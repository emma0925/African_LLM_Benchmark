Mike keeps in touch with 5 people by correspondence and then stops corresponding with 2 of them. Each of the others sends 2 letters of 5 pages each week. He receives the same response. If he could write one page every 6 minutes, how many hours would it take him to write one page a week?	3	"60 minutes equal 1 hour.
1 week has 7 days.
7 x 2 letters x 5 pages = 70 pages to write in a week.
