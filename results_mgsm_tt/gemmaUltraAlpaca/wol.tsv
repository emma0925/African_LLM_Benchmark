If a dance studio has 20 dancers, 20% of them are new dancers, 25% are jazz dancers, and the rest are hip hop dancers. How many of them are hip hop dancers?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of hip hop dancers in the dance studio, we can first subtract the percentage of new dancers (20%) from the total number of dancers (20). This gives us 18 dancers. Then, we can subtract the percentage of jazz dancers (25%) from the remaining number of dancers (18) to get 12 hip hop dancers. Finally, we can calculate 12/18 (which is 0.67) to determine that approximately 67% of the dance studio's dancers are hip hop dancers.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is not related to African languages. However, I will provide an answer to the math problem you have presented:

Let's say Uriah had x books, and after giving away 30 books, he has (x-30) books left. Since the number of books he gave away (30) is equal to the number of books he has left after giving them away, he will have (x-30) = x books left.

Therefore, if he had 30 books initially, he will have 0 books left after giving away 30 books.<eos>"

To complete the process of cutting bronze to make the statue, Poppy needs to cut 333 bronzes (2000 - 667 = 333).<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is not related to the African language, so it cannot be answered in that context. It requires a calculation based on the given information. 

To find the number of questions Marc did not answer, we can use the following formula:

Total number of questions = Number of hours worked x Average number of questions per hour

For the first test:

Total number of questions = 8 hours x 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

For the second test:

Total number of questions = 6 hours x 6 questions per hour = 36 questions

Therefore, the total number of questions Marc did not answer is:

Total number of questions - Number of questions per hour x Number of hours worked

= 40 - 36

= 4 questions

Therefore, Marc did not answer 4 questions on the second test.<eos>"

a number of dolls are displayed in a room: 5 red dolls, 3 dolls and a doll. the doll is worth 3 dolls, one red doll is worth $4. if it is clear that a doll is worth $5, how much will it cost to buy all the dolls?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the cost of buying all the dolls, we can first determine the value of the 5 red dolls and the single blue doll. 

Each red doll is worth $4, so the total value of the 5 red dolls is 5 x $4 = $20. 

The blue doll is worth 3 times the value of a red doll, so its value is 3 x $4 = $12. 

To find out the total cost of buying all the dolls, we need to add the value of the 5 red dolls and the single blue doll: 

$20 + $12 = $32. 

Therefore, to buy all the dolls, it will cost $32.<eos>"

Mandy owes Benedict $100. We're approaching a 2% interest rate. If Mandy can pay off that money in 3 months, how much should Benoit pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot provide answers in specific african languages. however, i can assist you in solving the math problem you have presented. 

to calculate the amount of money mandy should pay to benedict, we can use the simple interest formula: 

simple interest = principal x rate of interest x time

where 'principal' is the amount borrowed, 'rate of interest' is the interest rate charged, and 'time' is the time period for the loan.

in this scenario, the principal is $100, the rate of interest is 2%, and the time period is 3 months. 

to calculate the amount of interest, we can use the formula: 

interest = $100 x 2% x 3 months 

interest = $60 

so mandy owes benedict $60 in interest for the loan of $100.<eos>"

a salesman buys bags from a farmer for $20 each. If you take a bag from the farm to the store for $2, and all the bags are sold for $30 each to get a bonus of $400, how many bags do you sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The calculation is as follows: 

Total cost of bags from farmer = 20 x 100 = $2,000 

Total revenue from bags sold = 30 x 100 = $3,000 

Profit = $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000 

Therefore, 100 bags were sold.<eos>"

Marc is a mathematician. He calculates the number of hours per week for two different accounting firms that have different prices. The number of hours Marc spends with Accountant B is twice the number of hours Marc spends with Accountant A. Marc averages 1,000 hours per week.

Alternatively, Rose went to buy 4 cakes in one store. However, she bought 3 times more than she bought in another store. However, she went to another store and bought there 5 times more than she bought cakes. How much did she buy in a cake in 3 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Rose bought 4 cakes in one store and 3 times more cakes in another store. In a third store, she bought 5 times more cakes than she bought in the first store. To find out how much Rose bought in a cake in 3 days, we can use the following equation:

cakes_bought_in_store_1 = 4
cakes_bought_in_store_2 = 3 * more_cakes_in_store_2
cakes_bought_in_store_3 = 5 * more_cakes_in_store_3

Substituting the values given in the problem statement, we get:

cakes_bought_in_store_1 = 4
cakes_bought_in_store_2 = 3 * more_cakes_in_store_2 (i.e., 12)
cakes_bought_in_store_3 = 5 * more_cakes_in_store_3 (i.e., 20)

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought in 3 days is:

4 + (3 * 12) + (5 * 20) = 4 + 36 + 100 = 136

Thus, Rose bought 136 cakes in 3 days.<eos>"

The building has 3 entrances and exits A, B and C. If, for example, before an assembly, 30% of the students leave through door A, 3/5 exit through door B, the rest exit through door C, how many students leave through door C?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of students who leave through door C, we can use the percentage of students who exit through it.

Percentage of students who exit through door C = (30% + 3/5) = 33 1/3%.

Let's say the total number of students who attended the assembly was 100.

Then, the number of students who left through door C = 100 x 33 1/3% = 33.

Therefore, 33 students left through door C.<eos>"

Answer only. 
There are 4 fish in one tank and 32 in the other. The difference in the number of fish in each tank is twice the number of fish in the tank. How many fish are in each tank?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first find the number of fish in the smaller tank, which is 4. We can then use this information to find the number of fish in the larger tank. 

If there are twice as many fish in the larger tank as in the smaller tank, we can write:

2x fish in larger tank = 4 fish in smaller tank

x is the number of fish in the larger tank.

To solve for x, we can add the two equations together:

2x + 4 = 32

x = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in the larger tank and 4 fish in the smaller tank.<eos>"
