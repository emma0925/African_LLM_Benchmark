Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year he will grow seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. It will take how many years before he starts to make money from the lemon tree.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The calculation for the number of years it will take for Carlos to make money from the lemon tree is as follows:

Total cost of planting and maintaining the tree = $90 + ($3 x 7 x 15) = $90 + $561 = $651

Total revenue from selling 7 lemons per year = $1.5 x 7 x 10 = $105

Number of years needed to break even = $651 / $105 = 6.4 years (rounded up to the nearest whole number) = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 6 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.<eos>"	6

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, I am not able to answer the question in an African language as I don't have any knowledge about that language. However, I can answer it in English as follows: 

To find out how much water is left in 24 liters after adding 10 liters of orange juice and 15 liters of pineapple juice, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the mixture. 

Total water = Total amount of juice x (1 - ratio of water in juice)

Total water = 10 liters x (1 - 2/3)
Total water = 7 liters

Therefore, there are 7 liters of water left in the mixture.<eos>"	7

A giant dragon, Perg, sat atop Mount Farbo, breathing fire at anything within 1,000 meters. Polly could shoot a golden eagle, the only weapon capable of penetrating a dragon, at a distance of 400 meters, but within range of the dragon's flame. But when Polly held a sapphire stone, she could shoot the eagle three times as far as if she had not held the stone. If she held the stone, how far from reaching the flames could the dragon stop Polly and hit the golden eagle?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The dragon's flames were powerful enough to stop Polly within 40 meters of reaching the flames. With the sapphire stone, she could potentially shoot the eagle three times as far as without the stone, which would allow her to hit the dragon's weak spot and kill the beast.<eos>"	40

Answer only. 
John buys red ties twice as much as green ties. Red ties are 50% more expensive than green ties. He spends $200 on green ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the total cost of John's ties, we can first find the cost of one green tie by dividing the total cost ($200) by the number of green ties he bought ($40). This gives us the cost of one green tie is $5.

Then, we can find the cost of the red ties by subtracting the cost of the green ties from the total cost of the ties. This gives us the cost of one red tie is $10.

To find the total number of ties John bought, we can add the number of green ties and red ties. This gives us the total number of ties John bought is 5 (green) + 2 (red) = 7.

So, the total cost of John's ties is:

5 green ties x $40 each = $200
2 red ties x $10 each = $20

Total cost = $220

Therefore, John spent $220 on ties.<eos>"	220

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot answer questions that require calculations as it goes beyond my capacity to perform math operations. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve the problem. 

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the average weight of the bridge, we need to first find the total weight of the empty truck and the driver. This can be calculated by subtracting the combined weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight of the bridge.

Once we have found the total weight of the empty truck and the driver, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck by subtracting the total weight of the loaded boxes from the total weight of the bridge.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the average weight of the bridge is given by:

Max Boxes = (Total Weight of Bridge - Total Weight of Truck and Driver - Total Weight of Loaded Boxes) / Weight of each box

The calculation for the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry is as follows:

Raymond's amount of laundry = 2 x Sarah's amount of laundry

David's amount of laundry = 4 x Sarah's amount of laundry

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is:

(4 x Sarah's amount of laundry) - (2 x Sarah's amount of laundry)

= 3 x Sarah's amount of laundry

So if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then Raymond would have done 800 pounds of laundry and David would have done 400 pounds of laundry.<eos>"	400

I am sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot perform financial calculations. However, you can easily calculate the answer by subtracting the cost of 2 packs of flowers from the cost of 3 packs of flowers. This would give you the amount of money you save by buying 18 flowers at a better price.<eos>"	18

The hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and the hospital $200 per hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from visits?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the profit the hospital makes from visits, we can use the following formula:

Profit = (Revenue from patients x Number of patients per day x Number of hours per day) - Expenses

Assuming that the hospital charges $200 per hour for the patients and the doctors charge $150 per hour, we can estimate the following revenue and expenses:

Revenue = ($200 x 500) + ($150 x 24 x 500) = $300,000 + $360,000 = $660,000

Expenses = $150 x 24 x 500 = $360,000

Profit = $660,000 - $360,000 = $300,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $300,000 from visits.<eos>"	300000

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the shipping cost for Rory's order, we need to first add up the cost of the items ordered: $7.50 for the sandwich, $1.50 for two bags of matches, and $1.00 for two cakes, for a total of $9.50.

Then, we need to apply the 20% shipping fee to the subtotal: $9.50 x 1.20 = $11.40.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the shipping fee and the tax: $11.40 + $5 = $16.40.

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's order (including shipping and tax) is $16.40.<eos>"	16

Blake and Kelly have a competition to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a 10-yard long football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running on the 40-yard line and back. She does it 43 times. How much faster does the winner run than the loser?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The winner, Kelly, ran 43 times on the 40-yard line and back, while the loser, Blake, ran back and forth 15 times on the 10-yard long football field. Therefore, the difference in the distance covered between the two is (40-10) x 4 = 30 yards. However, we need to determine which one is faster. To do that, we can calculate the average speed of each of them.

Average speed of Blake:
Total distance covered = 15 x 10 = 150 yards
Total time taken = 15 minutes
Average speed = distance / time = 150 / 15 = 10 yards per minute

Average speed of Kelly:
Total distance covered = 43 x 40 = 1730 yards
Total time taken = (43 + 10) x 60 = 2870 minutes
Average speed = distance / time = 1730 / 2870 = 6.25 yards per minute

Since Kelly's average speed is faster, she is the winner. The winner runs 6.25 yards per minute faster than the loser.<eos>"	6

Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry, the question is not related to the African language. However, here's the solution to your math problem:

Let's say the number of red chickens is x and the number of white chickens is y.

The total number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens combined is 3x + 5x = 42.

To find the number of red chickens, we can use the fact that the red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day.

3x = 42 - 5x

-2x = -42

x = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 red chickens and 3 white chickens in Jerry's flock.<eos>"	3

The number of students in the school hall was 1000. The hall had three entrances A, B and C which also served as exits. If after the meeting an average of 30 percent of the students left the building using exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left using exit B, and the remaining students all left using exit C, count the number of students who left using exit C.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use algebra to calculate the number of students who left through exit C. 

Let x represent the number of students who left through exit C. 

We know that the total number of students in the hall at the beginning was 1000. 

After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A, which means 300 students left. 

3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, which means 240 students left. 

The remaining students left through exit C, so we can use the following equation to calculate the number of students who left through exit C: 

x + (3/5) * 240 = 250 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 250 - (3/5) * 240 

x = 110 

Therefore, 110 students left through exit C.<eos>"	110
