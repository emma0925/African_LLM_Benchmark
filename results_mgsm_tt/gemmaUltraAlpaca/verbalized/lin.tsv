Melanie works as a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, then sold two to the red house, then finally sold the rest to the orange house. If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is not related to the African language, so I will answer it in English.

To find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning, we can use the following steps:

1. Determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie sold to each house:
- Green house: one-third of her vacuum cleaners
- Red house: two vacuum cleaners
- Orange house: the rest of her vacuum cleaners (which is not specified, so we assume she sold all of them)

2. Calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:
- Green house: one-third of 3 = 1
- Red house: 2
- Orange house: however many vacuum cleaners were sold is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact number

3. Use the total number of vacuum cleaners sold to find the number at the beginning:
- Total number of vacuum cleaners sold = 1 + 2 + (however many were sold to the orange house)
- If we assume she sold all of her remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold = 6
- Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning = 6

Note that we cannot determine the exact number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning, since the information about the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house is not provided. However, we can estimate that she sold all of her remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house, and had 6 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.<eos>"	6

Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's. If Suzie's iPhone is a generation older, how old would Brandon's be?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, and Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's, then we can calculate the ages of Brandon's and Suzie's iPhones by subtracting the age of Ben's iPhone from the age of Suzie's iPhone. 

Let's say the age difference between Ben's and Suzie's iPhones is two generations. This means Suzie's iPhone is two generations newer than Ben's iPhone. 

To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can subtract the age of Ben's iPhone from the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

If the age difference between Ben's and Suzie's iPhones is two generations, then Suzie's iPhone is two generations newer than Ben's iPhone. 

If Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is 3 generations older than Ben's iPhone. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Brandon's iPhone is 3 generations older than Ben's iPhone.<eos>"	3

He has to read 4 pages of a science textbook, 20 pages of a social studies textbook, 7 pages of a history textbook and 8 pages of a geography textbook. This time, he has read 15 pages. If he has 4 days left to finish reading, how many pages does he have to read every day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out the number of pages he needs to read every day, we can use the following formula:

Total number of pages = 4x(science) + 20x(social studies) + 7x(history) + 8x(geography) = 69 pages
Total number of days = 4 + (20/24) + (7/365) + (8/365) = 29.5 days
Number of pages to read every day = Total number of pages / Total number of days = 69/29.5 = 2.3 pages (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, he needs to read 2.3 pages per day to finish all the textbooks within 4 days.<eos>"	4

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as Monday. His Monday-Wednesday mileage was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the answer, we need to first find out how many miles Walt walked on Monday. Since we know that he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can use that information as a starting point to find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

We know that on Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, we can multiply his Monday mileage by 6 to find the total number of miles he walked on Tuesday: 

4 miles x 6 = 24 miles 

Therefore, Walt walked 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to add the distance he walked on Monday and Tuesday. 

4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles 

So, Walt walked 28 miles on Wednesday.<eos>"	28

The calculation for the cost of each item after the 10% tax would be:

- Eggs: $3 + (3 x $3 x 10%) = $3.30
- Light bulb: $3 + (3 x $3 x 10%) = $3.30
- Cup: $3 + (3 x $3 x 10%) = $3.30
- Rat trap: $4 + (4 x $3 x 10%) = $4.30

Therefore, the total cost after tax would be:

$2.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.30 = $17.90<eos>"	17

If Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the rider to reach him before the rider finishes the race?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The rider on the skateboard (Tim) will reach Steve before the rider finishes the race, as Tim is skateboarding at a higher speed (264 feet per minute) than Steve's biking speed (440 feet per minute). The distance Steve has to ride is 3 miles, while Tim has to ride 2 miles. To calculate the time it will take for Tim to reach Steve, we can use the following formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, and the distance he needs to cover is 2 miles. So, the time it will take for Tim to reach Steve is:

Time = 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 7.32 minutes

Therefore, it will take Tim around 7 minutes to reach Steve from the school, assuming Steve is biking at a speed of 440 feet per minute.<eos>"	440

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Each friend would pay $27.50 for the entrance tickets and $22.50 for the food. ($33 - $4.50 = $28.50; $28.50 divided by 3 = $27.50 per person.) For the snowboarding tours, they would each pay $10.67 ($33 divided by 3 = $10.67 per person).<eos>"	10

<|user|>
Answer only. 
bats need 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects do you need per day to survive a pack of ten bats?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
You would need to provide more information to receive an accurate answer. The amount of food needed per day for a pack of ten bats will depend on various factors such as the species of bat, their age, and activity level. As a rule of thumb, it is estimated that one pound of insects per day can sustain a colony of about 500-1000 bats, but this can vary. Therefore, for a pack of ten bats, you may need to provide them with an appropriate amount of insects based on their individual needs.<eos>"	1000

Tom plants 10 seeds a year. He cuts PE 2 seeds a year. He starts with 50 seeds. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead. How many seeds are left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of seeds left, we can use the following formula:

Number of seeds left = (Total number of seeds planted) - (Number of seeds cut) + (Number of seeds that survived x 100%)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Number of seeds left = (50) - (2) + (30 x 100%)

Number of seeds left = 28

Therefore, after 10 years, there are 28 seeds left.<eos>"	28

Answer only. 
200 pounds of carrots should be distributed to 40 restaurants in Fulani Town. If each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The calculation is as follows:

Total weight of carrots: 200 pounds
Number of restaurants: 40

If each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, we can use the following formula to calculate the total weight of carrots that will not be used:

Total weight of carrots = Number of restaurants x Weight per restaurant

Total weight of carrots = 40 x 2

Total weight of carrots = 80

Therefore, 80 pounds of carrots will not be used.<eos>"	80

A classroom has 1,000 students. A classroom with 3 entrances A, B and C will be equally useful for exit. If, after the meeting, 30% of the students left the classroom on exit A, 3/5 on exit B and the rest on exit C, calculate the number of students who used exit C.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of students who used exit C, we can first find the total number of students who used exits A and B by multiplying the percentage by the total number of students (1,000).

Total students using exits A and B:
(30% x 1,000) + (3/5 x 1,000) = 600 + 600 = 1,200

To find the number of students who used exit C, we can subtract the total number of students using exits A and B from the total number of students:

Total students: 1,000
Total students using exits A and B: 1,200
Total students using exit C: 1,000 - 1,200 = 800

Therefore, 800 students used exit C.<eos>"	800

<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is not related to the African language, so I cannot answer it. However, to answer the question, we need to know the hourly rate at which Mike can write speeches. Let's assume that he can write a speech of 6 minutes at an hourly rate of $10. In that case, the number of hours he will spend writing in a week will be:

Number of hours = 40 hours (5 minutes per day * 5 days = 40 hours)

So, Mike will spend 40 hours in a week writing speeches.<eos>"	40
