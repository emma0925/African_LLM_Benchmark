There are twice as many sheep in Toulouse as there are in Charleston. There are four times as many in Charleston as there are in Seattle. If there are 20 sheep in Seattle, how many sheep are there in Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle combined?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined, we can use the following equation:

Toulouse = Charleston + Seattle

Substituting the values, we get:

Toulouse = 4 * Charleston + 2 * Seattle

Assuming that the number of sheep in Charleston and Seattle is the same, we can simplify the equation to:

Toulouse = 6 * Charleston

So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is six times the number of sheep in Charleston.<eos>"	6

In a dance school with 20 students, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% in Jazz dance and the rest in Hip-hop. How many students falsely enrolled in hip-hop?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of students who falsely enrolled in hip-hop, we can use the following formula:

Total number of students = 20 (contemporary) + 25 (jazz) + (hip-hop - number of students)

Let's substitute the values:

20 + 25 + (hip-hop - number of students) = 60

So, the formula simplifies to:

20 + 25 + (hip-hop - number of students) = 60

Adding 20 + 25 = 45, we get:

20 + 25 + (hip-hop - number of students) = 60

25 + (hip-hop - number of students) = 60

25 + (hip-hop - 25) = 60

So, the answer is:

25 + (hip-hop - 25) = 60

Or,

hip-hop - 25 = 35

Therefore, there are 35 students who falsely enrolled in hip-hop.<eos>"	35

A merchant is hesitating between two purchases: $5000 worth of jewelry or $8000 worth of art. His business consultant raised the price of jewelry by 2.5% and the price of art by 1.2% in the same month. If the merchant made the right bet that would get him so much money, how much would be in the tree?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The merchant would need to calculate the potential profit from each purchase and compare it. Assuming that the profit margin for the jewelry is the same as the consultant's suggested profit margin of 2.5%, and assuming that the profit margin for the art is the same as the consultant's suggested profit margin of 1.2%, the merchant can use the following calculations:

Profit on jewelry = $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit on art = $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,448

If the merchant decides to invest in the art, they will potentially earn more profit (8,448/5,250) x 100 = 163%. However, it's important for the merchant to consider the potential risks and uncertainties associated with each purchase before making a decision.<eos>"	163

Answer only. 
Marie sent a chicken for $12; 5 milk cartons for $3 each; 4 slices sold for $1.5 each; and some pizza boxes. Marie paid $50 in total. If the pizza boxes cost $8.50, how many pizzas did Marie send?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of pizzas that Marie sent, we can first subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Total cost of items: $50
Cost of other items: $8.50 + $3 + $1.50 = $13

So, the remaining amount paid for the pizzas is $37. 

Let's say each pizza costs $10 (this is just an estimate for the sake of example). Then, the number of pizzas Marie sent is:

$37 / $10 = 3.7

Since she cannot buy half a pizza, the number of pizzas she bought must be rounded up to the nearest one, which is 4. 

Therefore, Marie sent 4 pizzas, at a total cost of $40.<eos>"	40

Answer only. 
Aaron's bracelets are 2 times smaller than Siobhan's. Aaron's are half the size of Raymond's and 5 times smaller than Raymond's. If there are 40 of Raymond's, how many of Siobhan's would there be?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we can use the following equation:

Aaron's bracelets: 2 times smaller than Siobhan's
Raymond's bracelets: half the size of Aaron's
5 times smaller than Raymond's = 1/5 of a bracelet

Let's first find the number of bracelets each person has:

Aaron: 40 bracelets (as mentioned in the question)
Raymond: 400 bracelets (4 times 100)
Siobhan: 200 bracelets (as the size of Siobhan's bracelet is half that of Raymond's)

Now, we can use the equation:

1/5 of a bracelet = 40/4

1/5 of a bracelet = 10

So, to have the same number of bracelets, each person would need:

Aaron: 40 bracelets
Siobhan: 200 bracelets
Raymond: 400 bracelets

Therefore, the answer is 200 bracelets.<eos>"	200

Mike played ping-pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he played four holes. In the remaining 20 minutes, he played 25% more holes. How many holes did he play in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the unit of measurement used for the duration of Mike's game. Let's assume that the duration is measured in minutes. 

We can then use the following formula to calculate the total number of holes played:

Total number of holes played = (Number of holes played in the first 20 minutes) + (Number of holes played in the remaining 20 minutes)

Using the information provided, we can substitute the values as follows:

Total number of holes played = 4 + (25/100) * 40

Total number of holes played = 4 + 10

Total number of holes played = 14

Therefore, Mike played a total of 14 holes in the game.<eos>"	14

Ted Tyrannosaure decides to take a potato salad to the big meat dinners. He knows that each adult will need 10 Kg and the children half this weight. If 20 adults and 5 children come to the party, how many kilograms of salad will be prepared if everyone eats it?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
There are 25 adults and 5 children at the party. To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed, we can first find the total number of adults and then multiply by the weight per person. 

Total number of adults = 20 x 10 = 200 

Total weight of potato salad needed for adults = 200 x 10 = 2000 kg 

Total weight of potato salad needed for children = 5 x 5 = 25 kg 

Total weight of potato salad needed = 2000 kg + 25 kg = 2025 kg 

Therefore, 2025 kg of potato salad will be prepared for the party.<eos>"	2025

<|user|>
Answer only. 
200 kg of cartons will be distributed to 40 restaurants in a city. If each restaurant receives 2 kg of cartons, how many kg of cartons will not be used?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The calculation is as follows:

Total cartons distributed = 200 kg
Cartons used per restaurant = 2 kg
Number of restaurants = 40

Total number of cartons used = 2 x 40 = 80
Total number of cartons left unused = Total number of cartons distributed - Total number of cartons used = 200 - 80 = 120

Therefore, 120 kg of cartons will not be used.<eos>"	120

Mike keeps in touch with 5 people by correspondence and then stops corresponding with 2 of them. Each of the others sends 2 letters of 5 pages each week. He receives the same response. If he could write one page every 6 minutes, how many hours would it take him to write one page a week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is not related to the African language, so I cannot provide an answer specifically related to that. However, I can provide a general answer to the question.

To calculate the number of hours it would take Mike to write one page a week, we can use the following formula:

Total time = Time per page x Number of pages per week x Number of weeks

Let's assume that Mike takes 6 minutes to write one page. Then, the total time would be:

Total time = 6 minutes x 2 pages per week x 52 weeks

Total time = 150.4 minutes or approximately 2.5 hours

So it would take Mike approximately 2.5 hours to write one page a week.

Now, to answer the question related to the African language, we need more information about the question or the context in which it is being used.<eos>"	2
