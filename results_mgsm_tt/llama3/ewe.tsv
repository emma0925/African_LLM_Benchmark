15	A merchant is hesitating between two purchases: $5000 worth of jewelry or $8000 worth of art. His business consultant raised the price of jewelry by 2.5% and the price of art by 1.2% in the same month. If the merchant made the right bet that would get him so much money, how much would be in the tree?	125	"Wena wena, ngumntu wenza umntu! (Ah, ah, the merchant has made a good choice!)

If the merchant had chosen the jewelry, the new price would be $5000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5100.

If the merchant had chosen the art, the new price would be $8000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8120.

The merchant would have made a profit of $8120 - $5100 = $3020.

So, the merchant would have $5100 + $3020 = $8120 in his tree!"

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50 with a 25% discount on the total book sales. How much was the total book sales?	26	"Ngiyakuthandaza! (I'm happy to help!)

Ukuhweba lokho, ukuthandaza ukuba inkulu yokuqala, ukuthandaza ukuba 19.50. Ukuthandaza ukuba inkulu yokuqala ukuba 25% yokuqala. Ukuthandaza ukuba 19.50 ukuba 25% yokuqala, ukuba 19.50 ukuba 1/4 yokuqala. Ukuthandaza ukuba 1/4 yokuqala ukuba 4, ukuba 19.50 ukuba 4 x 19.50 = 78. Ukuthandaza ukuba inkulu yokuqala ukuba 78. (I'm happy to help!)

Translation: I'm happy to help! To solve this, we need to find the total book sales. The discount is 25% off the original price, which is $19.50. The original price is 25% of the total book sales.

25	Marie sent a chicken for $12; 5 milk cartons for $3 each; 4 slices sold for $1.5 each; and some pizza boxes. Marie paid $50 in total. If the pizza boxes cost $8.50, how many pizzas did Marie send?	2	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie sent:

Chicken: $12
Milk cartons: 5 x $3 = $15
Slices: 4 x $1.5 = $6
Pizza boxes: $8.50

Total cost: $12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50 = $41.50

Marie paid $50 in total, so the remaining amount is:
$50 - $41.50 = $8.50

This amount must be the cost of the pizzas. Since each pizza costs $8.50, Marie sent:

$8.50 ÷ $8.50 = 1 pizza

First, let's find the first half of eighty. Njengoko (half) of eighty is forty.

The second friend said twenty plus the first half, which is forty. So, twenty plus forty is sixty.

The third friend said twenty-five more than the first, which is eighty. So, twenty-five plus eighty is one hundred and five.

The correct answer is one hundred and five, njengoko!"

45	Mérédith is a freelance journalist and her job is to write a book on topics related to health and put it in her handbag every day. A book on a topic takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. The next week, she writes 5 books a day and on Tuesday she does 2/5 more. On Wednesday, she writes twice as much as the immortal. Consider how many hours she spent writing the books of the last three days.	104	"Wena, ngikubonga! (Hello, I'm happy to help!)

Mérédith wrote 5 books on Monday. Each book takes 4 hours, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more books than the previous day, which is 5 + (2/5) * 5 = 7 books. So, she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours writing on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as much as the previous day, which is 2 x 7 = 14 books. So, she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours writing on Wednesday.

In total, Mérédith spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours writing books on the last three days."

If he removed 30 magic books from the bag, how many toys would he have added?	15	Oya! (Ahaha!) Uriah's bag was too heavy, so he had to reduce its weight. He removed 30 magic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. So, he removed 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds of magic books. He also removed 15 kg, which is equal to 15 x 2.20462 = 33.06 pounds. So, in total, he removed 7.5 + 33.06 = 40.56 pounds. His toy, Isa, added 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he added, we can divide the weight of the toy by the weight of one toy: 1/2 pound = 0.5 pounds. 40.56 pounds / 0.5 pounds = 80.88 toys. So, Uriah would have added approximately 81 toys. Oya!

Jim spends 2 hours on the telescope initially. He spends half of that time, which is 1 hour, reading and watching. He does this 3 times a week. So, in a week, he spends 1 hour reading and watching. In 4 weeks, he will spend:

1 hour/week × 3 times/week × 4 weeks = 12 hours

So, Jim will spend 12 hours reading and watching in 4 weeks."
66	There are four schools that have qualified for a basketball tournament. Each school has qualified a women's team and a men's team with five members each.

74	Artie sells flowers in the village market. He sells three types of flowers: soucis, petunias and bégonias. He sells a basket of soucis for $2.74; a basket of petunias for $1.87 and a basket of bégonias for $2.12. Since he doesn't have a winner today, he decides to sell each item at the most appropriate dollar amount. If he sells 12 soucis, 9 petunias and 17 bégonias, how much money will he make?	88	"Nǐn hǎo! (Hello!) Let me calculate the total amount Artie will make:

12 soucis x $2.74 = $32.88
9 petunias x $1.87 = $16.83
17 bégonias x $2.12 = $35.84

Total amount: $32.88 + $16.83 + $35.84 = $85.55

Artie will make $85.55."
75	Luc used his time to build a loft with sand on the beach. He noticed that each floor of the loft took half the width of a summer house. What would be the same width of the loft if he built a 4-storey loft and the width of the last floor was 16 meters on peids?	60	"Kulula! (That's ""okay"" in Zulu)

If each floor takes half the width of a summer house, then the width of the last floor is 16 meters, so the width of the summer house is 16 x 2 = 32 meters.

If Luc builds a 4-storey loft, the width of the loft would be 32 meters."
76	Cécilia has now bought a puppy. Her veterinarian told her that she should feed it 1 bowl of dog food a day for 180 days. Now, she will feed it 2 bowl a day for the rest of her life. If there are 110 bowl of food in one bowl, how many bowl of food will she use in the first year?	5	"Nǐn mafé! (You're welcome!)

Cécilia's puppy will eat 1 bowl of food per day for 180 days, which is 180 bowls. For the remaining days, she will feed it 2 bowls per day. There are 365 days in a year, so she will feed it 2 bowls per day for 185 days (365 - 180 = 185). That's 370 bowls.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bowls she will use in the first year: 180 + 370 = 550 bowls.

So, Cécilia will use 550 bowls of food in the first year."
77	Raymond's messages weighed twice as much as Sarah's; Sarah's was 4 times as heavy as David's. When Sarah's message weighed 400 Kg, imagine the difference between Raymond's and David's messages.	100	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Raymond's message weighed 2 x 400 = 800 kg.
Sarah's message weighed 400 kg.
David's message weighed 400 / 4 = 100 kg.

So, the difference between Raymond's and David's messages is 800 - 100 = 700 kg."

How many greeting cards did he have left?	17	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Charlie had 10 greeting cards initially. He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31. He got 23 more on his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54. He gave 9 to his brother, so he had 54 - 9 = 45. He used 28 to write on a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

85	Gene collects old souvenirs in a red suit. He has a souvenir suit for each day of his vacation. Each suit is the square root of the width of the suit. The square root of the width of each suit is the square root of its height. Since he was twenty-three yards, he traveled four times a mile. Now he has thirty-four yards. How many square yards does his suit have?	44	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) I'll try to help you with that. Let's break it down:

* Gene has a souvenir suit for each day of his vacation, and he was on vacation for 23 yards (which is 4 times a mile).
* Each suit is the square root of its width. Let's call the width of each suit ""x"". Then, the square root of the width is √x.
* The square root of the width is also the square root of the height. So, we can write an equation: √x = √x (since height = width for a square).
* Since √x = √x, we can square both sides to get x = x.
* Gene now has 34 yards, which means the total area of all the suits is 34 square yards.

Now, let's get to the calculation:

* Since each suit is the square root of its width, we can write the area of each suit as √x × √x = x.
* Gene has 23 suits (one for each day of his vacation). So, the total area of all the suits is 23x.
* We know the total area is 34 square yards, so we can set up the equation: 23x = 34.
* To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 23: x = 34 ÷ 23 = 1.48 (approximately).

So, the width of each suit is approximately 1.48 yards. Since the suit is a square, the height is also 1.48 yards. The area of each suit is then:

Area = width × height = 1.48 × 1.48 = 2.19 square yards.

Since Gene has 23 suits, the total area is:

Total area = 23 × 2.19 = 50.17 square yards.

Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) I hope that helps!"
86	A Gregorian clock ticks three times a day. When it starts ticking, it ticks until the Grid stops. When it first ticks, it ticks four times slower; when it ticks a second time, it ticks three times slower; when it ticks a third time, it ticks two times slower than a second and a half.	22	Ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko si ko
87	One company pays its employees $600 a month. It also gives a 10% raise to all employees who have been with the company for at least five years. If Sylvie had completed five years of work last summer, what would her salary be if she had completed three more years of work?	9360	Siyenza! (That's right!) Sylvie's salary would be $660 (600 x 1.10) after the 10% raise. After completing three more years, her salary would be $660 x 1.10 x 1.10 x 1.10 = $800.

89	Christina planned to have a memorial service, and 0.75 cups were needed for each invitation and 1/4 of the invitations did not come. When she invited 16 people and each cup cost $2, how many cups would she use?	24	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* 0.75 cups are needed for each invitation
* Christina invited 16 people
* But 1/4 of the invitations did not come, so she only needs cups for 3/4 of the invitations
* 3/4 of 16 is 12 invitations
* For each of the 12 invitations, she needs 0.75 cups
* So, the total number of cups needed is 12 x 0.75 = 9 cups

Each cup costs $2, so the total cost would be 9 x $2 = $18.

93	Lee used to beat Gérald by two minutes in the 400-meter dash, but after changing his diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee ran the 400-meter dash in 38 laps, how long would Gérald have to run after the change in diet?	36	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Gérald's original time was 2 minutes behind Lee's. Lee's time is 38 laps. So, Gérald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 laps.

Gérald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time: 40 laps x 0.10 = 4 laps.

So, Gérald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 laps.

98	Some cars were stranded on the highway. Some were able to get off the highway in the first 15 minutes and 20 others in the last 15 minutes. 5 cars got off the highway to avoid being in the highway. There were 30 cars on the highway at the beginning of the highway; how many were able to get off first?	5	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) I'll help you with that. Let's break it down:

* 5 cars got off the highway to avoid being on the highway.
* 20 cars got off the highway in the last 15 minutes.
* Total cars that got off the highway = 5 + 20 = 25 cars.

Since there were 30 cars on the highway initially, the number of cars that got off the highway in the first 15 minutes is:
30 (initial cars) - 25 (cars that got off) = 5 cars.

So, 5 cars got off the highway in the first 15 minutes."

The first player played the game 20 times before Jérôme returned; the second player played the game 1/4 more times than the first player; and the third player played the game 10 times more than the fourth player. When the fourth player played the game 60 times, how many times did the game go down in a day?	175	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Here's the answer:

The first player played 20 times.
The second player played 20 + 20/4 = 25 times.
The third player played 10 more times than the fourth player, so if the fourth player played 60 times, the third player played 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The fourth player played 60 times.
Adding all the times, we get: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175 times.

So, the game went down 175 times in a day."

Poppy has 1,000 tiles. She places a quarter of them, which is 1,000 ÷ 4 = 250 tiles. That leaves 1,000 - 250 = 750 tiles.

The mother places a third of the remaining tiles, which is 750 ÷ 3 = 250 tiles. So, the mother places 250 tiles.

To find out how many tiles are left, subtract the number of tiles placed by Poppy and the mother from the total number of tiles: 1,000 - 250 - 250 = 500 tiles.

124	She helped me in my mother's womb. She was given sixty sets of cards to build the wheel and other sets that were already built. She climbed on one-third of the cards to build the wheel. There are now thirty cards in all. How many cards were used to build the wheel before Jennie got sick?	10	"Moo sibi yena! (That's a tough one!) 

Let's break it down: 
She was given 60 sets of cards, and she used 1/3 of them to build the wheel. 
So, 1/3 of 60 is 20. 
She used 20 sets of cards to build the wheel. 
Now, there are 30 cards in all. 
If she used 20 sets to build the wheel, that means she used 20 sets of cards to build the wheel and some other cards. 
Let's call the number of cards used for the wheel ""x"". 
Then, the number of cards used for something else is 30 - x. 
Since she used 20 sets of cards in total, we can set up the equation: 
x + (30 - x) = 20 
Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 20 
Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = -10 
Divide both sides by 2: 
x = -5 
Wait, what? That can't be right! 
Let's try again. 
x + (30 - x) = 20 
Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 20 
Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = -10

147	Debra observes a mountain of octopuses to see how many come and go in a day. She sees 30 octopuses come out in the first six hours, then sees an average return in the last six hours, then sees twice as many octopuses leave in the next six hours than the first time, and all eight that do not come and go are back in cages in the last six hours. How many octopuses do Debra see in cages in the last six hours of the day?	75	"Kulula, ngumntu ngoku, ngikuba ngokuthetha. (Okay, let me calculate this.) 

30 octopuses come out in the first six hours, and then an average return in the last six hours, so that's 30 octopuses again. Then, twice as many octopuses leave in the next six hours than the first time, so that's 60 octopuses. 

Total octopuses that come and go are 30 + 30 + 60 = 120. 

All eight that do not come and go are back in cages in the last six hours, so ngikuba ngokuthetha, 8 ngokuthetha. (I calculate, 8 are left.)"
148	Brittany and her mother went to the museum. The entrance fee was $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother told the cashier to donate $1 for adults and $1 for children. If she was given $8, how many dollars did the cashier get?	30	Nǐ sī! (That's correct!)

(That's easy!) Charlie has 12 friends, and Charlie has three times as many as Dorothée. So Dorothée has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends. Jacques has four times as many as Dorothée, so Jacques has 4 × 4 = 16 friends.
150	Steve and Tim decided to find someone to drive him home from school. As Steve's home was far away, he set a speed limit. Steve was two miles [3 km] from school and was riding 440 yards per minute. Tim was two miles [2 km] from school. If Tim was skateboarding at 264 rpm, how long would it take the winner to finish the race?	4	"Wena ukuthi ukuthola ngane? (What is the question again?)

Ah, I see! You want to know how long it would take the winner to finish the race. Let's break it down:

Steve is 2 miles (3 km) from school and is riding at 440 yards per minute. To find out how long it would take him to reach home, we need to convert the distance from miles to yards. There are 1760 yards in a mile, so:

2 miles x 1760 yards/mile = 3520 yards

Now, we can divide the distance by the speed to find the time:

3520 yards / 440 yards/minute = 8 minutes

Tim is 2 miles (2 km) from school and is skateboarding at 264 rpm. To find out how long it would take him to reach home, we need to convert the distance from miles to yards and then divide by the speed. Let's do that:

2 miles x 1760 yards/mile = 3520 yards

Now, we can convert the speed from rpm to yards per minute. There are 66 feet in a yard, so:

264 rpm x 3.14 (pi) x 3 feet/foot x 1 yard/3 feet = 264 yards/minute

Now, we can divide the distance by the speed to find the time:

3520 yards / 264 yards/minute = 13.3 minutes

So, it would take Steve 8 minutes to reach home, and it would take Tim 13.3 minutes to reach home. The winner would be Steve, and it would take him 8 minutes to finish the race."
151	Shawnda decided that a bicycle repair shop would be a good idea for the children in his village. He started charging them 25 cents for a pair of bicycles. On the first day, 5 people came with their bicycles, 3 came with their tricycles, and finally, someone came with a bicycle. How much did they earn?	5	Ndi nyingi! (That's a lot!) Shawnda earned 25 cents x 5 = 1.25 dollars from the bicycles, 25 cents x 3 = 0.75 dollars from the tricycles, and 25 cents from the bicycle, making a total of 2.00 dollars.
152	Carl bought ten packets of cookies. Each package contained six cookies. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much would Carl get if he bought with an extra $10?	4	"Ndi kubona! (I understand!)

Carl bought 10 packets of cookies. Each packet has 6 cookies, so he has 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.

If Carl has an extra $10, he will have $6.00 + $10.00 = $16.00.

Ndi kubona! (I understand!)"
153	Dave bought a large frit cake and ate fourteen of them before a sleeping bird came to kill him and gave him the cake. When the bird landed, it split the frit that Dave had eaten in half. Then three turkeys chased the bird away from the food and each of them ate three frit cakes. Then a cat ate the remaining three frit cakes. The remaining five frit cakes were scattered by the chickens and the fire. How many frit cakes were in the cake before Dave bought it?	48	"Wena ukuthi? (What's the question?)

Ah, ngicela ukuthetha. (I'll answer.)

Ngicela ukuthetha ukuthi, kakhulu frit cake ngicela ukuthetha ukuthi, 29 frit cake. (I'll answer that, there were 29 frit cakes.)

Wena ukuthi? (What's the question?)"
154	Student Kimo scheduled three one-hour lessons each day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Scheduled two-hour lessons on Tuesdays and Sundays, If 16 weeks in six months of school, how many hours did Kimo spend studying in one six-month period?	272	Kwaku, Kimo yɛn nyɛ 16 weeks. A week, Kimo study 5 days, 3 hours each day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and 2 hours each day on Tuesdays and Sundays. So, Kimo study 3 x 3 + 2 x 2 = 15 hours each week. In 16 weeks, Kimo study 15 x 16 = 240 hours.
155	Bill makes 300 pies a day, 120 croissants, and 60 pies. The pies are 4 cm long, the croissants are 6 cm long, and the pies are 2 feet long. If Bill used all the pies, how many feet would they make?	280	Hamba kahle! (Goodbye!)
156	If the monkeys are raised in a zoo, the gatekeeper sleeps a village every 2 months. If it takes 200 monkeys for the macaques, 400 for the monkeys, and 100 for the monkeys, how much sleep will they get in 2 months?	1400	"Moo ngwana, ngwana! (Let me calculate, okay!) 

200 monkeys for the macaques, 400 for the monkeys, and 100 for the monkeys, that's a total of 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 monkeys.

The gatekeeper sleeps a village every 2 months. So, if there are 700 monkeys, the gatekeeper will sleep 3 villages in 2 months (700 ÷ 200 = 3.5, but we can't have a fraction of a village, so it's 3 villages).

Moo ngwana, ngwana! (There you have it, okay!)"
157	Blake and Kelly trained to see who could run the fastest in 15 minutes. They planned to do it on a 100-yard court. Blake ran 15 times. Kelly ran once and refused to run with Blake. He started running at 40 yards. He ran 34 times. How many yards did the winner run over the loser?	80	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the distance each of them ran:

Blake ran 15 times, and each time was 100 yards, so Blake ran a total of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran 34 times, and each time was 40 yards, so Kelly ran a total of 34 x 40 = 1360 yards.

To find out how many yards the winner ran over the loser, subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance:

1500 (Blake) - 1360 (Kelly) = 140 yards

So, Blake ran 140 yards more than Kelly!"

161	Anakin and Locsin went on a hunting trip today. Anakin has 10 house stars, a hippopotamus 6, and a pigeon 3. Locsin has 5 house stars less than Anakin, a hippopotamus 3 less than Anakin, and 2 pigeons more than Anakin. How many pairs are there?	32	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Anakin has 10 house stars, Locsin has 5 less, so Locsin has 10 - 5 = 5 house stars.

Anakin has 10 house stars, Locsin has 3 less, so Locsin has 10 - 3 = 7 house stars.

Anakin has 6 hippopotamus, Locsin has 3 less, so Locsin has 6 - 3 = 3 hippopotamus.

Anakin has 3 pigeons, Locsin has 2 more, so Locsin has 3 + 2 = 5 pigeons.

So, the pairs are:
- 10 house stars and 5 house stars
- 6 hippopotamus and 3 hippopotamus
- 3 pigeons and 5 pigeons

There are 3 pairs. Ngiyabonga!"
162	If the price of a bag is $20 and the first one goes up 20% every two months, how much will the price of a bag be after 36 months?	92	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

163	In a room there are many toys: 5 red cars, 3 paintings, and a poupé. 3 paintings cost the poupé, and a red car costs $4. If a painting costs $5, how much are all the toys worth?	50	"Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha (I can show you). 

Mfano: 

* 3 paintings = poupé (3 x $5 = $15)
* 5 red cars = 5 x $4 = $20
* Poupé = $15 (since it's equal to 3 paintings)
* Total = $20 + $15 = $35

Hivyo, sababu ya kukuonyesha kuwa vyombo vyote vina thamani ya $35. (So, it's clear that all the toys are worth $35.)"

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than what they'll give her, how much will they pay in a year?	18000	"Hamba kahle, Jessica! (Goodbye, Jessica!)

Here's the calculation:

1. College tuition: $300/month
2. Tuition: $200/month
3. Mortgage: $500/month

Total monthly bills: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than what they'll give her, so she'll pay:

$1000 x 1.5 = $1500/month

In a year, she'll pay:

$1500/month x 12 months = $18,000/year"

Kuna wachezaji 240, na 80 yao ni Wa-Japani. Wengine ni Wa-China. Kuna wachezaji 60 wa kiume, je wanaume wengine ni nani?

(There are 240 athletes, and 80 of them are Japanese. The rest are Chinese. There are 60 boys, who are the others?)

Kwa kuamua, wachezaji wa China 240 - 80 = 160. Na wachezaji 60 wa kiume, hivyo wachezaji wa kike ni 160 - 60 = 100.

(To conclude, the Chinese athletes are 240 - 80 = 160. And the boys are 60, so the girls are 160 - 60 = 100.)

Hivyo, kuna wachezaji 100 wa kike Wa-China. (So, there are 100 Chinese girls.)"

211	Jerry raises chickens. Red hens lay 3 eggs a day and broilers lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry lays 42 eggs a day. If there are more broilers than broilers, how many broilers does Jerry have?	4	Ndiyo, njia ya kufanya hesabu ni kama hii: Red hens lay 3 eggs a day, so if Jerry lays 42 eggs a day, then 42 - 3 = 39 eggs are laid by broilers. Since broilers lay 5 eggs a day, the number of broilers is 39 / 5 = 7.8. Since you can't have a fraction of a chicken, Jerry must have 8 broilers.

227	At his lunch, Chad asked for a Burrito for his birthday. The Burrito cost $6.50. He asked for $2.00 worth of meat, $1.00 worth of cheese, $1.00 worth of pie, and $2.25 worth of broken noodles. He made the first choice of spending $3.00 more, which would give him a chance to win some extra cash and booze. He had a $5.00 gift card that he had used at the store. How much money was left to pay?	9	Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Chad's total bill is: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $2.25 = $12.75. He used a $5.00 gift card, so he still needs to pay: $12.75 - $5.00 = $7.75. If he spends $3.00 more, he'll have: $7.75 - $3.00 = $4.75 left.
228	Kalinda and her mother try to complete a puzzle game with 360 tiles. Kalinda moves 4 tiles in a minute, and her mother moves half as many tiles in a minute. How long would it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I like that!) 

Kalinda moves 4 tiles per minute, and her mother moves half as many, which is 2 tiles per minute. Together, they move 4 + 2 = 6 tiles per minute.

To find the total number of minutes it would take to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of tiles (360) by the number of tiles they move per minute (6):

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

So, it would take Kalinda and her mother 60 minutes to complete the puzzle. Ndiyakuthanda! (I like that!)"
229	Ashlyn went to the farm two months later and found that 30% of the eggs were ready to be eaten and she rejected them. When she returned two weeks later, she gathered the remaining 3/4 of the eggs ready and rejected them. How many eggs hadn't been eaten after those two weeks?	21	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi ingane elinjele ngoku. (Let me calculate this for you.)

Initially, there were eggs, and 30% were rejected. 30% of eggs is 0.3 x = 0.3x. So, 0.3x eggs were rejected.

The remaining eggs are 1 - 0.3 = 0.7x. After two weeks, 3/4 of these eggs were rejected. 3/4 of 0.7x is 0.525x.

So, the total number of eggs rejected is 0.3x + 0.525x = 0.825x.

The number of eggs that hadn't been eaten after those two weeks is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs rejected. This is x - 0.825x = 0.175x.

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi ingane elinjele ngoku. (Let me calculate this for you.)"

Answer: 23

Translation: 20 (Jessa's age) + 18 (Jeanne's age) + 16 (Mary's age) = 54. Since we want to know the total age when the ages were added together, we add 1 year to the total age, making it 54 + 1 = 55."

244	Griffin had 24 chickens and gave 5 to Kyle. He gave Billy Kyle twice as many. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her chickens, then Colby took Kyle's quantity. If Griffin finally had 27 food items, how many did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 chickens and gave 5 to Kyle, leaving him with 24 - 5 = 19 chickens.
2. Griffin gave Billy twice as many as he gave Kyle, so he gave Billy 2 x 5 = 10 chickens. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 chickens.
3. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her chickens. Let's call the number of chickens Ginger gave Griffin ""x"". After this, Griffin had 9 + x chickens.
4. Colby took Kyle's quantity of chickens, which is 5. Now Kyle has 5 - 5 = 0 chickens.
5. Griffin finally had 27 food items, which are chickens. So, we can set up the equation: 9 + x = 27 - 5 (since Colby took 5 chickens from Kyle). Simplifying the equation, we get: 9 + x = 22.
6. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us: x = 13.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 13 chickens."

After the film was completed, Jane would receive a 10% discount for her work. How much did Jane pay?	27000	"Wena wena, nguye kuthetha ukuthetha! (Let's calculate, let's calculate!)

First, calculate the total hours Jeanne worked: 6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

Then, calculate the total amount Jeanne would have earned without the discount: 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

Now, calculate the discount: 10% of $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, calculate the total amount Jeanne paid after the discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Wena wena, nguye kuthetha ukuthetha! (Let's calculate, let's calculate!) Jeanne paid $27,000."
