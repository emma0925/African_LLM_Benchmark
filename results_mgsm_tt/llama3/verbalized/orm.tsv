2	Josh decides to try copying a house. He buys it for $80,000 and leaves $50,000 for repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

R30,000 (Profit)

Here's the calculation:

Initial cost: $80,000
Cost of repairs: $50,000
Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000
Value of the house after repairs: $130,000 + (150% of $50,000) = $130,000 + $75,000 = $205,000
Profit: $205,000 - $130,000 = $75,000
Josh's profit after selling the house is $75,000."	75000

7	Carla is caching a 200 GB file. By default, she can cache 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the cache, Windows Update forces a restart to load, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla must restart to cache from the beginning. What cache is needed to cache the file?	160	"Kulani! (That's ""Okay!"" in Yoruba)

Carla needs 200 GB cache. She can cache 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 100 minutes to cache 200 GB. But, she will lose 40% of the way, which is 80 GB, and then she will have to restart. So, she will have to cache from the beginning. It will take her 20 minutes to restart. Then, she will have to cache 200 GB again, which will take 100 minutes. So, the total time needed is 20 + 100 = 120 minutes."	120
8	After driving for 3 hours at a speed of 60 km/h, John turned around as he realized that he had forgotten several important things at home. He tried to get home in 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours in traffic jams. He spent the next half hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before driving for the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. At the end of the 4 hours, how far was he from home?	45	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

John drove for 3 hours at 60 km/h, which means he covered a distance of:

3 hours x 60 km/h = 180 km

He then turned around and drove for 2 hours in traffic jams, which means he didn't cover any distance.

Next, he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, which is equivalent to:

0.5 hours x 30 mph x 1.60934 km/mile (conversion factor) = 4.545 km

Finally, he drove for 4 hours at 80 km/h, which means he covered a distance of:

4 hours x 80 km/h = 320 km

Adding up all the distances, John is now:

180 km - 4.545 km + 320 km = 495.455 km

away from home."	495
9	For the first 40 hours of work in a week, Eliza is paid $10 per hour, plus 1.2 times the overtime. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she get for the week?	460	Kwaku, ntumi nua! (That's 40 hours multiplied by $10 per hour, which is $400. For the 5 overtime hours, it's 5 hours multiplied by $10 per hour, which is $50, plus 1.2 times that, which is $60. So, $50 + $60 = $110. Adding the two amounts, $400 + $110 = $510.)	510
10	One new program had 60 outcomes in the first month. In the second month the number of outcomes in the first month dropped three times, but in the third month it decreased by 30%. What was the total outcome of the program in three months?	366	Ndiyo, ngwena! (Yes, okay!) In the first month, the program had 60 outcomes. In the second month, the number of outcomes dropped three times, so it became 60 ÷ 3 = 20 outcomes. In the third month, the number of outcomes decreased by 30%, so it became 20 - 20 x 0.3 = 14 outcomes. To find the total number of outcomes in three months, add the outcomes of each month: 60 + 20 + 14 = 94. Ndiyo, ngwena! (Yes, okay!) The total outcome of the program in three months was 94.	94
11	Toola went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastas.She bought 3 cans of donuts for $68 each, 2 cans of biscuits for $80, and 6 cans of biscuits for $55 each.How much was the total cost?	694	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye, friend!)

3 cans of donuts for $68 each = 3 x $68 = $204
2 cans of biscuits for $80 = 2 x $80 = $160
6 cans of biscuits for $55 each = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694"	694

15	A trader needs to choose between two buying plans: $5,000 worth of goods or $8,000 worth of electronics.His financial advisor predicts that the price of electronics will rise by 2.5% in the same month.If the trader chooses to make a profit at the end of the month, how much profit will it make?	125	"Sabi sabi, ngwana! (Ah, I understand, young one!)

Let's calculate the profit:

Option 1: $5,000 worth of goods

* Cost: $5,000
* Sell price: $5,000 (assuming no change in price)
* Profit: $0

Option 2: $8,000 worth of electronics

* Cost: $8,000
* Price increase: 2.5% of $8,000 = $200
* New price: $8,000 + $200 = $8,200
* Sell price: $8,200
* Profit: $8,200 - $8,000 = $200

So, the trader will make a profit of $200 if he chooses to buy $8,000 worth of electronics."	8000

19	Marisa walks the 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If you want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Marisa walks 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles per hour.

Then, she walks 2 miles in another hour, so her speed for the next 2 miles is also 2 miles per hour.

Total distance walked so far is 4 + 2 = 6 miles, and total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Average speed for the first 6 miles is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles, she should walk the remaining 6 miles in:

6 miles / (4 miles per hour - 3 miles per hour) = 6 miles / 1 mile per hour = 6 hours

So, she should walk the remaining distance at a speed of 1 mile per hour.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	1
20	I have 10 liters of vodka which is two thirds water, I would like to add 15 liters of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But if I pour one liter of vodka, how much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Mfana, ngikwazi ukuthi ukubonga ukuthi uthola amahlelo! (Young one, I will calculate for you!)

Let's break it down:

Initial mixture: 10 liters of vodka (2/3 water) + 15 liters of pineapple juice (3/5 water) = 25 liters

After pouring 1 liter of vodka, you have 24 liters left.

Vodka: 10 - 1 = 9 liters remaining
Pineapple juice: 15 liters remaining

Now, let's find the total water content:

Vodka: 2/3 water, so 9 liters x (2/3) = 6 liters water
Pineapple juice: 3/5 water, so 15 liters x (3/5) = 9 liters water

Total water content: 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters

So, there are 15 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters."	24

31	Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another 20 says more than half of the original. A third says 25% more than the original. What is their average estimate?	80	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

To calculate the average estimate, we need to find the original number of jelly beans. Let's call it x.

The first friend estimates 80, so x = 80.

The second friend says more than half of the original, which means x/2 + 10 = x. Solving for x, we get x = 60.

The third friend says 25% more than the original, which means x + 0.25x = x + 0.25x = 1.25x. Since 1.25x = 80, x = 64.

Now, we can calculate the average estimate:

(80 + 60 + 80) / 3 = 220 / 3 = 73.33

So, the average estimate is approximately 73.33. Ngiyabonga!"	73
32	John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to take care of their daily walks and chores. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. How many hours a week does it take to take care of dogs?	35	"Wena ukuthula! (Hello! In isiZulu)

36	Terry eats 2 cookies a day. Currently 4 cookies are sold for $5.00 each. How much does a cookie cost in 30 days?	75	Nǐ yóu shén me! (What's the matter?) Ah, math question! Okay, let's calculate... Terry eats 2 cookies a day, so in 30 days, Terry will eat 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. If 4 cookies cost $5.00, then 1 cookie costs $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25. So, in 30 days, 60 cookies will cost 60 x $1.25 = $75.00. Nǐ yóu shén me? (What's the matter?)	75
37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy a video game. He has 13 sets of Legos and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many Legos do I still have in my collection?	2	"Kwaku, wɔnka nkyɛm! (I'll answer!) 

John started with 13 sets of Legos. Each set is sold for $15, so he makes 13 x $15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 x $20 = $160. He has $5 left. To find out how much he has left, subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made: $195 - $160 = $35. Since each Lego set is worth $15, he has 35 / 15 = 2.33 sets of Legos left. Since you can't have a fraction of a set, he has 2 sets of Legos left."	2

First, we need to find out how many pounds of potato chips you can eat in a day. You need 2,000 calories, and you've already eaten 1,800. So, you have 200 calories left.

One pound of potato chips has 250 calories. To find out how many pounds you can eat, divide 200 by 250. That's 0.8 pounds.

Since one pound is equal to 453.59 grams, multiply 0.8 pounds by 453.59 grams per pound. That's approximately 362.87 grams.

So, you would eat around 363 grams of potato chips if you had 2,000 calories per day and had eaten 1,800 calories before. Ndiyakuthandile!"	1800

Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 x 60 = 120.

The total number of students is 300, and 120 are boys. So, the number of girls is 300 - 120 = 180.

Since there are 60 girls for every teacher, the number of teachers is 180 ÷ 60 = 3.

75	Luke is spending time building a sand tower on the shore, and he eventually figures out that each level of the sand tower is half a square foot on the lower level. If he built a 4-story sand tower instead of a 16-square-foot top level, what is the average square foot per level?	60	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ukuthula kwakho ukuthula! (Your calculation is correct!)

To calculate the average square foot per level, we need to find the total square footage of the sand tower and then divide it by the number of levels.

The total square footage of the sand tower is 16 square feet (since the top level is 16 square feet).

Since each level is half the size of the level below it, we can set up an equation to find the total square footage:

16 = 2^4

Where 2 is the factor by which each level is smaller than the level below it.

To find the average square foot per level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

16 ÷ 4 = 4

So, the average square foot per level is 4 square feet.

Vincent can buy 3 cans for $2.50, so the cost per can is $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83 per can. He can also buy 2 cans for $1, so the cost per can is $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per can. To buy 18 cans at the lower price, he would pay 18 x $0.50 = $9.00. At the higher price, he would pay 18 x $0.83 = $14.94. He would save $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94.	5

90	Ted T-Rex planned to bring the dinosaurs to the park. He knew that an adult dinosaur would eat 10 pounds of the dinosaur, and a child would eat half of the adult. If there were 20 adults and 5 children in the park, how many pounds of the dinosaur would he bring to the park if he hoped to have enough to feed them all?	225	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ngicela ukuthetha... (Let me calculate...)

Adults: 20 x 10 pounds = 200 pounds
Children: 5 x 5 pounds (half of adult) = 25 pounds

93	Lin used to run the 400 meters two seconds faster than Gerald in the 400 meters race, but Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lin ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how fast would Gerald, with a better diet, run the 400 meters?	36	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Lin ran 38 seconds, and Gerald used to run 2 seconds slower, so Gerald used to run 40 seconds. Gerald improved his speed by 10%, so his new time would be 40 - 0.1 * 40 = 36 seconds.	36
94	The number of donkeys in a neighbourhood is less than the number of dogs and donkeys put together. If there are two dogs for every dog, how many animals are there in the neighbourhood?	348	"Mfana, ngiyabonga! (Ah, my friend, thank you!) 

Kwathi kuthetha, kuthetha abantu abadala (Let's calculate, let's calculate the number of animals)... 

There are x donkeys, and 2x dogs. Since the number of donkeys is less than the number of dogs and donkeys put together, we can write the inequality: x < x + 2x 

Simplifying, we get: x < 3x 

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 < 2x 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 0 < x 

So, there is at least 1 donkey. 

Now, let's add the number of dogs and donkeys: x + 2x = 3x 

Since there is at least 1 donkey, the minimum number of animals is 3x = 3(1) = 3. 

Therefore, there are at least 3 animals in the neighbourhood. 

Mfana, ngiyabonga! (Ah, my friend, thank you!)"	3
95	Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in espionage. How many girls are not in espionage?	40	"Mfana, ngikhotha ukuthi kuthethwa ngokutholakala. (My friend, I'll calculate it for you.)

Let's break it down:

* 2/5 of 200 fifth graders are boys, which means 80 boys.
* 2/3 of 200 fifth graders are girls, which means 133 girls.

Since 133 girls are in espionage, the remaining girls who are not in espionage are:

* Total girls - Girls in espionage = 200 - 133 = 67

So, mfana, there are 67 girls who are not in espionage. (Ngiyabonga, mfana!)"	67

98	Vehicles clashed on the motorway. Some vehicles passed through the first 15 minutes of the traffic closure, and then 20 more vehicles passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. 5 vehicles took the exit from the line and did not drive through the traffic closure. If there were initially 30 motorcycles on the motorway, how many vehicles passed through the traffic closure in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Total vehicles = 30 (motorcycles) + unknown number of vehicles
5 vehicles took the exit and did not pass through the traffic closure
So, the unknown number of vehicles = Total vehicles - 5

Vehicles passed through in the first 15 minutes + Vehicles passed through in the remaining 15 minutes = Total vehicles - 5

Vehicles passed through in the first 15 minutes + 20 = Total vehicles - 5

Subtract 20 from both sides:
Vehicles passed through in the first 15 minutes = Total vehicles - 5 - 20

Substitute 30 for Total vehicles:
Vehicles passed through in the first 15 minutes = 30 - 5 - 20
Vehicles passed through in the first 15 minutes = 5

So, 5 vehicles passed through the traffic closure in the first 15 minutes!"	15

100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a given day. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's first friend. If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, which is 20 + 20/4 = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's first friend, which is 20 + 10 = 30 times.

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

In total, the doorbell rang 20 + 25 + 30 + 60 = 135 times.

If he had 4 more days to finish all his reading, on average, how many pages would he need to read in a day?	6	"Mfana, ngikubonga! (My friend, I understand!)

Solon has to read: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

He has already read 15 pages, so he still needs to read 39 - 15 = 24 pages.

He has 4 days left, so he needs to read 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.

103	It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles from the coast to the opposite side of the country, how many minutes would it take to cover the entire city?	140	"Ndi a ku ngwana! (That's a good question!) 

To calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city, we need to multiply the distance by the time it takes to cover 3 miles.

Distance = 42 miles
Time to cover 3 miles = 10 minutes
Time to cover 42 miles =?

First, let's convert the distance to 3-mile intervals:
42 miles / 3 miles = 14 intervals

Now, multiply the number of intervals by the time it takes to cover 3 miles:
14 intervals × 10 minutes = 140 minutes

Ndi a ku ngwana! (That's the answer!) It would take 140 minutes to cover the entire city."	140

Poppy puts a quarter of 1000 holes, which is 250 holes. So, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 holes left.

Then, her mother puts a third of the remaining holes, which is 750 / 3 = 250 holes. So, there are 750 - 250 = 500 holes left.

Ndi yina, 500 holes ndi yina! (That's a lot, 500 holes!)"	500

107	Frank watches TV every night after he finishes his homework. On Monday and Tuesday nights, he watches his favorite one-hour program. On Tuesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. On Fridays, he watches two one-hour episodes because he can get up for the weekend. In total, he watches 7 hours of TV, so how many 30-minute episodes does he watch on Wednesdays?	3	"Wena! (Hello!) 

Let's break it down:

* Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours (1 hour each)
* Tuesday: 30-minute episodes (unknown number)
* Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 hours

Total hours: 2 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours

He watches 7 hours of TV, so he must watch 7 - 6.5 = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes on Wednesdays.

Since each 30-minute episode takes 0.5 hours, he watches 1 episode on Wednesdays."	1

110	Marcel and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most fruit in the cluster, so they interpret what they find. It is interesting that someone made a mistake: Beatrice's is 2 inches high and 24 inches long, and Marcel's is 3 inches high and 14 inches long. If they both ate as much as they wanted, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Ngiyamuhle! (I'm happy to help!)

The total length of the fruit is Beatrice's length + Marcel's length = 24 + 14 = 38 inches.
The total height is Beatrice's height + Marcel's height = 2 + 3 = 5 inches.

Since they ate as much as they wanted, we can assume they ate the entire fruit. So, the total volume of the fruit is 38 inches long x 5 inches high = 190 cubic inches.

To find the average, we divide the total volume by 2 (since there are 2 of them): 190 cubic inches / 2 = 95 cubic inches per person.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures. Since it can hold 6 times as many pictures as the British phone, the British phone can hold 1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures.

Since the British phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds Jamal photographed at the zoo, the number of birds he photographed is 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

115	Sasha, after buying some wood, realizes that the price of the wood has gone up by 50% in the last few months. She decides to sell because she has left over. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left over, each of which she paid her $10 for. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each of which she bought for $16 each. How much profit would she make if she sold them all?	90	"Moo-oo-oo! (That's ""Okay!"" in Yoruba)

Sasha has 10 x 2 x 4 x 10 = 800 square inches of 2x4 wood, which she bought for $10 each, so that's 10 x $10 = $100. She also has 5 x 4 x 4 x 10 = 1600 square inches of 4x4 wood, which she bought for $16 each, so that's 5 x $16 = $80. In total, she spent $100 + $80 = $180. 

Now, if she sells them all, she'll get 10 x $10 = $100 for the 2x4 wood and 5 x $16 = $80 for the 4x4 wood. That's a total of $100 + $80 = $180. She'll make a profit of $180 - $180 = $0. She won't make any profit because she bought the wood at the same price she's selling it for!"	0

If Adrienne and Leah's salary had increased at the same time, and Adrienne had earned $40,000 four years earlier, what would their total salary have been four years later?	95200	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Adrienne's salary 4 years earlier = $40,000
Adrienne's salary increase = 30% of $40,000 = $12,000
Adrienne's salary 4 years earlier = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000

Adrienne's salary increase 4 years later = 40% of $52,000 = $20,800
Adrienne's salary 4 years later = $52,000 + $20,800 = $72,800

Leah's salary 4 years later = Adrienne's salary 4 years earlier + 30% of Adrienne's salary 4 years earlier
= $40,000 + 30% of $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000

Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can cycle 440 miles per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can skateboard 264 miles per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before finishing the race?	4	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Steve's distance is 3 miles, and he can cycle 440 miles per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we can divide the distance by the speed: 3 miles / 440 miles per minute = 0.0069 minutes. To convert this to hours, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.0069 minutes * 60 = 0.414 hours. Steve will get home in approximately 0.414 hours.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, and he can skateboard 264 miles per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we can divide the distance by the speed: 2 miles / 264 miles per minute = 0.0076 minutes. To convert this to hours, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.0076 minutes * 60 = 0.456 hours. Tim will get home in approximately 0.456 hours.

Since Steve will get home first, the winner will wait at home for approximately 0.456 - 0.414 = 0.042 hours. This is equivalent to 2.52 minutes. Ndiyabonga!"	2

153	Dave bought a large packet of french fries and ate fourteen, before a hungry seagull snatched the packet from his hand. When the seagull landed, he ate less than half of the french fries Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons threatened him away from the food, each eating three pieces of french fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. The rabbits took the last five french fries and left. How many french fries were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'll try my best to answer!)

Let's break it down:

* Dave ate 14 french fries.
* The seagull ate less than half of what Dave ate, so it ate 7 french fries (since 14 ÷ 2 = 7).
* The three pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 9 french fries in total.
* After the pigeons, there were 14 (Dave's) + 7 (seagull's) - 9 (pigeons') = 12 french fries left.
* The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries, which is 2/3 × 12 = 8 french fries.
* The rabbits took the last 5 french fries, leaving none.

To find the total number of french fries, we add up what everyone ate:

* Dave: 14
* Seagull: 7
* Pigeons: 9
* Raccoon: 8
* Rabbits: 5

That's a total of 14 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 43 french fries.

So, when Dave bought the packet, there were 43 french fries in it."	43

171	Jake is walking through the Entomology Museum. He sees 80 rodents each with 8 feet, 90 insects each with 6 feet, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates each with 10 feet. How many feet does Jake see in total?	1210	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthula! (I love to chat!)

 Jake is walking through the Entomology Museum and sees:

* 80 rodents with 8 feet each, so that's 80 x 8 = 640 feet
* 90 insects with 6 feet each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 feet
* 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 feet each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 feet

In total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 feet!"	1210
172	There are four birds on a caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is equal to Sally Thirty-two and Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old, what is the total age of the four birds?	51	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Sizophila ukuthi... (Let me calculate...)

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Sally Four is equal to Sally Thirty-two, and Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

The total age of the four birds is: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years.

Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy!)"	51
173	Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay off all of her loans each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300 per month, her credit cards have a minimum payment of $200 per month, and her husband's loans have a minimum payment of $500 per month. If Jessica wanted to pay 50% less than that, how much would she pay off in a year?	18000	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Student loans: $300 x 0.5 = $150 per month
Credit cards: $200 x 0.5 = $100 per month
Husband's loans: $500 x 0.5 = $250 per month

Total monthly payment: $150 + $100 + $250 = $500

In a year, Jessica would pay off: $500 x 12 = $6,000"	6000
174	Billie barbecues the skin of the rabbit and has a few to prepare to make the rabbit salad for his large family gathering. Because of its size, he has 60 rabbits to pass through. Since the rabbits are roughly the same size, each takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut. Billie takes about a minute and a half to peel a rabbit, but for some it only takes about 5 seconds. How long does it take to finish making the rabbit?	95	Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Billie needs to peel and cut 60 rabbits. He takes 1.5 minutes to peel one rabbit, so for 60 rabbits, it will take him 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes. But, for some rabbits, it only takes 5 seconds, so we need to subtract the time it takes to peel those rabbits. Since there are 60 rabbits, and some take only 5 seconds, let's assume 10 rabbits take 5 seconds each. That's 10 x 5 = 50 seconds. To convert 50 seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 50 / 60 = 0.83 minutes. So, Billie saves 0.83 minutes. Now, let's subtract this from the total time: 90 minutes - 0.83 minutes = 89.17 minutes. Therefore, it will take Billie approximately 89.17 minutes to finish making the rabbit salad.	89
175	Juan and his brother Carlos are selling a gallon of beets for $3.00 and a gallon of sugar for $2.00 each, so they sell 20 coconuts for $0.50 each.

177	Zayed spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and donates half of the rest to his favorite charity. $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses, and $700 for his wife's shopping and other household expenses. If Zayed earns $6,000 a month, how much money would he still have after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm going to answer!)

Zayed earns $6,000 a month. He spends:

* 1/4 of his salary on rent = $1,500
* 1/3 on car fuel = $2,000
* Half of the rest on charity = $1,000 (since $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $3,500, and half of that is $1,750, but he also spends $200 on his daughter's expenses, so he has $1,750 - $200 = $1,550 left, and half of that is $1,000)
* $700 on his wife's shopping and other household expenses

Total expenses: $1,500 + $2,000 + $1,000 + $700 = $5,200

Zayed has $6,000 - $5,200 = $800 left."	800

183	Two teams of track runners compete in the 4 and 400 meter races; each race team consists of four members who each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a fixed track area. One of the two teams is very agile, with each member running their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less agile; their first run is their 400 meters in 60 seconds and after each lap they run the next race 3 seconds faster than the previous race. Using this information, which team is the fastest second winner?	2	Moo nkhondo! (That's the answer!) The first team is the fastest, with a total time of 4 x 55 = 220 seconds. The second team's total time is 60 + (60 - 3) + (60 - 6) + (60 - 9) = 246 seconds.	246

Jenna's mother had 20 flowers. Jenna picked half of her mother's flowers, which is 20 ÷ 2 = 10 flowers. So Jenna picked 10 flowers. If they picked a few flowers together, that means they picked 20 (her mother's flowers) + 10 (Jenna's flowers) = 30 flowers."	30

188	If a merchant buys a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and if the merchant sells each sack for $30 and makes a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Ko si nini? (What's the question?)

Let's break it down:

Cost of buying a sack: $20
Cost of transporting a sack: $2
Selling price of a sack: $30

Profit per sack: $30 - ($20 + $2) = $8

Total profit: $400

Number of sacks sold: $400 ÷ $8 = 50 sacks

So, the merchant sold 50 sacks!"	50

190	John collects peaches for 3 hours. He can collect 2 peaches in a minute. How many peaches can a peach collect?	360	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye!) Ah, I think there's a mistake in the question. John collects peaches, not a peach collects peaches. If John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he can collect 2 peaches in a minute, then we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, John can collect:

60 minutes/hour x 3 hours = 180 minutes

In 180 minutes, John can collect:

180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John can collect 360 peaches!"	360

198	Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. A month later she collected three times that number. In the second month she collected fewer than 20 cards than in the first month. In the third month she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuba nginguqu! (I love answering in Zulu!)

Let's break it down:

1. Elaine had 20 cards initially.
2. A month later, she collected 3 times that number, which is 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected fewer than 20 cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the first and second months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has:

20 (initial) + 60 (second month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

199	Mark is a copywriter. He sends the same amount of articles per week to two different publishers, who each pay him differently for each article. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. If Mark publishes a total of 1,000 articles per week, Publisher A pays him 5 cents per article. In a week, how much money does Mark make?	7500	Ndiyo, Mark anaenda kwa shilingi 5 za kila makala na Publisher A, na anaenda kwa shilingi 10 za kila makala na Publisher B. Kwa wiki, anaenda kwa shilingi 5 za kila makala kwa makala 500, na shilingi 10 za kila makala kwa makala 500. Kwa hiyo, anaenda kwa shilingi 5 x 500 + 10 x 500 = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 shilingi.	7500

214	Jerry had two barrels, each of which made 4 gallons of water per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big barrel held twice as much water as the smaller barrel. Now the big barrel holds four times as much water as the smaller barrel. How much water does the smaller barrel hold?	8	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'll answer!)

Let's break it down:

Let the amount of water in the smaller barrel 4 minutes ago be x.

Since the big barrel held twice as much water as the smaller barrel, the big barrel held 2x water 4 minutes ago.

Now, each barrel makes 4 gallons of water per minute, so in 4 minutes, the smaller barrel will make 4x gallons of water, and the big barrel will make 8x gallons of water.

The problem states that now the big barrel holds four times as much water as the smaller barrel. So, the amount of water in the big barrel now is 4x, and the amount of water in the smaller barrel now is x.

We know that the big barrel held 2x water 4 minutes ago, so it has 2x + 8x = 10x water now.

We also know that the smaller barrel held x water 4 minutes ago, so it has x + 4x = 5x water now.

The problem asks for the amount of water in the smaller barrel now, which is 5x.

After losing 8 water cards, James has 40 - 8 = 32 water cards.

After buying 14 rain cards, James has 20 + 14 = 34 rain cards.

James now has 30 fire cards, 34 rain cards, and 32 water cards.

The total number of cards is 30 + 34 + 32 = 96.

The number of water cards is 32.

To find the percent chance of drawing a water card, divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:

(32 / 96) x 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percent chance of drawing a water card is 33%."	33

228	Kalinda is making a 360-degree puzzle game with her mother. Kalinda can add 4 puzzles per minute by default. Her mother can add half as many puzzles per minute to Kalinda by default. How many hours will it take them to finish this puzzle game?	1	"Wena ukuthula! (What a wonderful question!)

Kalinda can add 4 puzzles per minute, and her mother can add half as many, which is 2 puzzles per minute. Together, they can add 6 puzzles per minute.

The total number of puzzles is not specified, but let's assume it's x. To find the time it takes to finish the game, we can set up the equation:

6 puzzles/minute × time (in minutes) = x

To find the time, we can divide both sides by 6:

time (in minutes) = x / 6

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

time (in hours) = x / 360

Now, let's say the total number of puzzles is 3600 (which is a reasonable number for a 360-degree puzzle game). Then:

time (in hours) = 3600 / 360 = 10 hours

Wena ukuthula! (What a wonderful answer!) It will take Kalinda and her mother 10 hours to finish the puzzle game."	10

249	On Monday, Sue ate four times her sister's cookie, on Tuesday she ate twice her sister's cookie, on Monday she ate five cookies, and the next day she ate 13 cookies. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

Sue ate 4 times her sister's cookie on Monday, which means her sister ate 1 cookie and Sue ate 4 cookies. Then Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday, which means she ate 5 - 4 = 1 cookie more than her sister.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 13 cookies and her sister ate half of that, which is 6.5 cookies. So Sue ate 13 - 6.5 = 6.5 cookies more than her sister.

In total, Sue ate 1 + 6.5 = 7.5 cookies more than her sister.

Since one cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 7.5 x 200 = 1500 calories more than her sister."	1500
