8	He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours standing in a traffic jam. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. At the end of those 4 hours, how far away is he from home?	45	"Kwaku, kofi yɛn nyinaa! (Ah, my friend, let's do the math!)

First, he spends 2 hours in traffic jam, so he doesn't cover any distance.

Next, he drives at 30 miles per hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles.

Now, he drives at 80 miles per hour for 4 hours. Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles.

Total distance = 15 miles + 320 miles = 335 miles.

Kofi, kofi! (Ah, my friend!) He is still 335 miles away from home."	335

Eliza worked 40 hours at $10 an hour, so she earned $400. For the 5 overtime hours, she earned 1.2 x $10 = $12 an hour, so she earned $60. In total, she earned $400 + $60 = $460."	460

Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, which is 5/3 = 1 vacuum cleaner. She sold 2 more in the red house, so that's 1 + 2 = 3 vacuum cleaners. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which she sold in the orange house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners she started with, we add the number of vacuum cleaners she sold in the green and red houses to the number she has left in the orange house: 3 + 5 = 8 vacuum cleaners."	8

15	A trader wants to make a choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. The financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% in the same month and the electronics market will increase by 1.2%. If the trader wants to increase his profit by making a choice at the end of this month, how much profit will this be?	125	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

If the trader chooses jewelry, the value will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is $125. The total value will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

If the trader chooses electronics, the value will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is $96. The total value will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

The difference in profit between the two options is $8,096 - $5,125 = $2,971.

So, the trader will make a profit of $2,971 if they choose electronics."	2971

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

2/3 of 10 liters of orange juice is water, which is 6.67 liters (approximately). 3/5 of 15 liters of pineapple juice is water, which is 9 liters. Total water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

You pour out 1 liter of orange juice, which means 1 liter of water is also poured out. So, the remaining water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

29	While shopping for shoes, Gloria found a pair that fit her shoe budget. However, she had to choose between the shoes and two pairs of heels, which together cost five dollars more than the shoes. If one pair is $33 and the other is twice as much, how much are the shoes worth?	104	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

Let's break it down: 

Shoes + Heels = Shoes + (33 + 2 * 33) = Shoes + 99

Since Heels cost 5 dollars more than Shoes, we can set up an equation:

Shoes + 99 = Shoes + 5

Subtracting Shoes from both sides:

99 = 5

Now, subtract 5 from both sides:

94 = Shoes

So, the shoes are worth 94 dollars!"	94

39	Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, but she can jump half as fast as she runs. She can leap three miles an hour. If she runs a third of the time and walks two thirds of the time, how many miles can she cover in six hours?	18	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Kwaku! (Let me calculate!)

If she can leap 3 miles per hour, and she jumps half as fast as she runs, then she runs 6 miles per hour.

Since she runs a third of the time, she runs for 2 hours out of 6 hours.

In 2 hours, she can run 2 x 6 = 12 miles.

Since she walks two thirds of the time, she walks for 4 hours out of 6 hours.

In 4 hours, she can walk 4 x 1 = 4 miles.

In total, she can cover 12 + 4 = 16 miles in 6 hours.

43	According to the nutrition guide, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag has 5 portions, how many grams could you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you already eat 1,800 calories?	48	"Wena ukuthetha! (I understand!)

Let's calculate the total daily calorie intake allowed: 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories

Since one serving has 250 calories, you can have:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since there are 5 portions in the bag, you can eat:

0.8 servings x 60 grams per serving (assuming 300 grams bag has 5 portions) = 48 grams

So, you could eat 48 grams of chips."	48
44	Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 spiral candles. A pound of beeswax and wikis costs $10.00 in supply. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?	20	"Moo nkhono! (That's the answer!)

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total revenue = 20 candles x $2.00 per candle = $40.00
Total cost = 1 pound beeswax + 1 wiki x $10.00 per pound/wiki = $10.00
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00"	30
45	It takes an average of 4 hours to research and write a blog article. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Monday. She wrote twice as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Wednesday.	104	"Wena ukuthi? (What's the question?)

Ah, I see! Let's break it down:

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times as many articles as she did on Monday. To find this out, we multiply 5 by 2/5, which gives us:

5 x (2/5) = 5 x 0.4 = 2

So, on Tuesday, she wrote 2 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote half as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2 articles on Tuesday, we divide 2 by 2, which gives us:

2 ÷ 2 = 1

So, on Wednesday, she wrote 1 article.

In total, she wrote 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 articles.

How many hours did she spend writing these articles? She spent 4 hours per article, so:

8 articles x 4 hours/article = 32 hours

Wena ukuthi? (What do you think?)"	32

47	The red ones are 50% more expensive than the blue ones. He spent $200 on the blue ones, which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the blue ones?	800	"Ndiyo, njawulo! (Yes, I understand!) 

If the blue ones cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them, that means he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ones.

The red ones are 50% more expensive, so the red ones cost $60 each (40 x 1.5).

Let's say he bought x red ones. Then, the total cost of the red ones is 60x.

Since he spent a total of $400 (200 on blue ones and 200 on red ones), we can set up the equation:

200 + 60x = 400

Subtracting 200 from both sides gives:

60x = 200

Dividing both sides by 60 gives:

x = 3.33

So, he bought 3 red ones."	3

51	Tom's boat can travel at 10 miles per hour. It travels from 1 to 4 hours a day. Then it travels back at 6 miles per hour. How long does it take to return?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Tom's boat travels from 1 to 4 hours a day, which means it travels 10 x 4 = 40 miles.

It travels back at 6 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to return, we divide the distance by the speed: 40 miles / 6 miles per hour = 6.67 hours.

So, it takes Tom's boat approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes to return. Ngiyabonga!"	40
52	Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. 15 pounds needs to be taken out of him: his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each; his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he takes out 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to take out?	15	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds from his book bag. 30 comic books weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. So, he needs to take out 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to take out 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. Ndiyakuthanda! (I love you!)	15

54	The Dotfire sisters were driving home with seven cats from a local animal shelter when their mother called to tell them that two of their cats had kittens. The first cat, Patsy, says she has three times as many cats, and the other, Trixie, says she has 12. How many cats does the Dotfire family have now?	40	"Wena ukuthi? (What's the question?)

Let's count the cats:

Initially, the Dotfire sisters had 7 cats.
Patsy has 3 times as many cats as the initial 7, which is 3 x 7 = 21 cats.
Trixie has 12 cats.
In total, they had 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 cats.

Now, their mother told them that two of their cats had kittens. Let's assume each of these two cats had kittens. If each cat had 3 kittens, that's 6 kittens in total.

So, the total number of cats now is 40 (initial cats) + 6 (kittens) = 46 cats.

Wena ukuthi, 46! (And that's the answer!)"	46

57	A wooden bridge can't carry more than 5000 kg. A freight truck filled with the same boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the fuel and empty car is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the truck when it does not exceed the weight limit of the bridge?	83	"Moo nkhondo! (That's the answer!)

Let's break it down:

1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms (approx.)
1 box = 15 pounds = 15 x 0.453592 kg ≈ 6.804 kg

Combined weight of fuel and empty car = 3755 pounds ≈ 1704.5 kg

Total weight capacity of the bridge = 5000 kg

Remaining weight capacity = 5000 kg - 1704.5 kg ≈ 3295.5 kg

Number of boxes that can be loaded = 3295.5 kg / 6.804 kg ≈ 484.5 boxes

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is approximately 484 boxes."	484

59	A fruit bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruits each and 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush. How many fruit bushes are there in total?	187	"Kwaku, nipa wɔn ɛnne wɔn nipa. (I don't understand the question)

 Wait, let me calculate... Ah, ah, ah! Nnipa wɔn ɛnne wɔn nipa! (I understand now!)

The fruit bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruits each, so that's 6 x 20 = 120 fruits. Add the 67 individual fruits, and you get 120 + 67 = 187 fruits. Since you didn't specify the number of fruit bushes, I'll assume you want to know the minimum number of fruit bushes required to produce 187 fruits. Since each fruit bush has at least 20 fruits in each cluster, we can divide 187 by 20 to get the minimum number of fruit bushes. 187 ÷ 20 = 9.4, so we need at least 10 fruit bushes."	10

78	Vincent buys 3 bouquets for $2.50 or 2 bouquets for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at a lower price?	6	"Vincent, ngumzi wena! Ukuthetha ngokuthetha, ukuthetha ngokuthetha! (Vincent, my friend! Buying 18 flowers at a lower price, buying 18 flowers at a lower price!)

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at $2.50 per bouquet, that's 18 ÷ 3 = 6 bouquets. 6 bouquets at $2.50 each is $15.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at $1 per bouquet, that's 18 ÷ 2 = 9 bouquets. 9 bouquets at $1 each is $9.

Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at a lower price."	18

Kwaku kwa ku kwa ku! (Let me calculate!)

Two women gathered one-sixth of a gallon, which is 24 L / 6 = 4 L each. So, they gathered 4 L + 4 L = 8 L.

One boy gathered 6.5 L.

Total water gathered is 8 L + 6.5 L = 14.5 L.

There are 24 L in total. So, the water left is 24 L - 14.5 L = 9.5 L.

84	One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win?	15	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

If the team won 8 more games than they lost, and they played 22 games in total, then let's say they lost x games.

The number of games they won is x + 8, since they won 8 more games than they lost.

The total number of games is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games."	15

When he puts the 5 cookies in the refrigerator, he throws them away, and now there are 110 cookies in total.	50	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Henry baked 5 cookies more than double what he baked last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year ""x"". Then, the number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 5.

He threw away 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 2x + 5 - 5 = 2x.

We know that the total number of cookies is 110, so we can set up the equation 2x = 110.

Solving for x, we get x = 55.

So, Henry baked 55 cookies last year. This year, he baked 2x + 5 = 2(55) + 5 = 115 cookies.

But wait, he threw away 5 cookies, so the actual number of cookies he has is 115 - 5 = 110 cookies.

If Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photos in the zoo?	6	"Ndi m'nyama! (I'll answer!)

Let's break it down:

Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos.
Since Jamal's phone can hold six times as many photos as Brittany's, Brittany's phone can hold 1,800 / 6 = 300 photos.

The maximum number of photos Brittany can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photos of ducks in the zoo. So, let's call the number of ducks ""x"". Then, 300 = 50x.

To find the number of ducks, divide both sides by 50: x = 300 / 50 = 6.

Sese (Sez) is twice as old as Brooke, so let's call Brooke's age ""x"". Then, Sez's age is 2x.

In 2 years, their combined age will be 28. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide by 3:

x = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Sez is twice as old, Sez is 16 years old.

If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have after all these expenses and help?	350	Mzuri sana! (That's great!) Let me calculate for you. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500. He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000. The other half on his beloved charity is $6,000 x 1/2 = $3,000. He gives $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses and $700 for his wife's groceries and other household items, which is $200 + $700 = $900. So, his total expenses are $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $900 = $7,400. He earns $6,000 a month, so he will have $6,000 - $7,400 = -$400. Oh no! Zaid has overspent! He will have a deficit of $400.	400

There are 3 rooms with equal groups of rats. So, each room has 6/3 = 2 rats. 2 rats * 6 pieces of straw = 12 pieces of straw per room. Since there are 3 rooms, 12 pieces of straw * 3 rooms = 36 pieces of straw for the rats. For the small animals in the 10 rooms, each gets 5 pieces of straw. So, 10 rooms * 5 pieces of straw = 50 pieces of straw. In total, Russell is giving out 36 + 50 = 86 pieces of straw.	86

Month 3: 2% of $104.04 = $2.0808, so the new balance is $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

188	A merchant bought some bags from a farmer for $20 a bag. If each bag cost $2 to transport from the field to the warehouse, and the merchant sold all the bags for $30 each and made a total profit of $400, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I can help you with that. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bags: $20 per bag x number of bags =?

Let's call the number of bags ""x"". Then, the total cost is $20x.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is $2x.

The total cost to the merchant is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The merchant sold each bag for $30, so the total revenue is $30x.

The merchant made a profit of $400, so we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by $8, we get:

x = $50

So, the merchant sold 50 bags. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	50

The total cost of the pencils and the pen is $1.20 + $0.30 + x.

We know that the total cost is $1.50, so we can set up the equation:

$1.20 + $0.30 + x = $1.50

To solve for x, we can subtract $1.20 and $0.30 from both sides of the equation:

x = $1.50 - $1.50

x = $0.00

So, the pen costs nothing!"	0
196	200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a particular city. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots are not used?	120	"Waa ka kele! (That's a math problem!)

If each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots, the total amount of carrots distributed is:

40 restaurants x 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots initially, the amount not used is:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Waa ka kele! (That's the answer!)"	120

198	In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month; in the third month, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokémon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Igama lamancane wena ukuthola ngamabili ngamabili ngamabili (Let me calculate for you)

First month: x
Second month: x - 20
Third month: 2(x + x - 20) = 2x + 2x - 40 = 4x - 40

Total: x + (x - 20) + (4x - 40) = 6x - 60

Ngicela ukuthola (Let me calculate again)

x = 100 (for example)
Total: 6x - 60 = 6(100) - 60 = 600 - 60 = 540

Igama lamancane wena ukuthola ngamabili ngamabili ngamabili (You now have 540 Pokémon cards)"	540
199	Mark is a proofreader. He proofreads an equal number of sentences each week for two different printers, each paying a different amount for each sentence. Printer B pays twice as much for Mark as Printer A. Mark proofreads a total of 1,000 sentences each week, and Printer A pays 5 cents per sentence.	7500	Ko ko ko! Ndi ndi ndi! Printer A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns 5 cents x 500 sentences = $25 for Printer A. Printer B pays twice as much, so 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 10 cents x 500 sentences = $50 for Printer B. Total earnings per week, 25 + 50 = $75.	75
200	Every morning he gets 5 buckets of water and every afternoon 6 buckets of water. If each bucket contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get per day?	55	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ekhaya kubantu! (Good day!) 

Ngicela ukuthola! (Let me calculate!) 

Every morning, he gets 5 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters. So, 5 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 25 liters.

Every afternoon, he gets 6 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters. So, 6 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 30 liters.

Total liters of water per day = 25 liters (morning) + 30 liters (afternoon) = 55 liters.

209	Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates that sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the total purchase cost of each cup	145	"Wena! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates that sold for $6,000 each.

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost of 6 plates = 6 x $6,000 = $36,000

Cost of 20 dozen cups = $36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

Cost of 1 dozen cups = $34,800 / 20 = $1,740

Cost of 1 cup = $1,740 / 12 = $145

So, the total purchase cost of each cup is $145. Wena!"	145
210	Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, the jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, and she's getting $5 for each child she watches. Every time she mows the lawn, her parents pay her $4, and if Sarah saves $10 before she starts babysitting, how long before she buys her jacket and shoes?	10	"Wena ukuhlonipha! (Let me calculate!)

Sarah needs $30 for the jacket and $20 x 2 = $40 for the shoes, so she needs a total of $30 + $40 = $70.

She earns $5 for each child she watches, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20 after watching the neighbor's kids 4 times.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so if she mows the lawn 3 times, she'll earn $4 x 3 = $12.

Sarah already has $10 saved, so she'll have a total of $20 + $12 + $10 = $42 after watching the kids and mowing the lawn.

She still needs $70 - $42 = $28 to buy the jacket and shoes. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she'll need to mow the lawn 7 more times to earn the remaining $28.

Wena ukuthula! (That's the answer!)"	28

230	Mark bought 12 cars for the company. Each car sold for $20,000. He paid a 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for each one. How much did he pay for everything?	276,000	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungenisa indlela yokuthola amathini. (Hello! I'm glad you're trying to find the answer.)

First, calculate the total amount Mark got from selling the cars: 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, calculate the tax: 10% of $240,000 = $24,000

Then, add the additional $1000 for each car: 12 cars x $1000 per car = $12,000

Add the tax and the additional cost to the total amount from selling the cars: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

235	John has ordered some of our pizzas to share with his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each of them can have 4 pieces. The pizzas are only sold in 8 pieces. How many pizzas does John need to order?	10	"Hamba kahle! (That's ""goodbye"" in Zulu, but I'll answer your question instead!)

To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of pieces his friends want (20 friends x 4 pieces each = 80 pieces) by the number of pieces per pizza (8 pieces). So, we divide 80 by 8, which gives us 10 pizzas. John needs to order 10 pizzas."	10

245	In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?	7	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthula! (I love to chat!)

Kwakunje, ngiyabonga ukuthi ngiwa ngicabanga ukuthi ngicela ukuthula ngokuthula. (Ah, I see! I'm happy to help you with that.)

Let's break it down. The difference in the number of cormorants is 32 - 4 = 28. This difference is twice the number of fish, so the number of fish is 28 / 2 = 14.

Since both pools have the same number of fish, we can divide the total number of fish by 2 to find the number of fish in each pool. 14 ÷ 2 = 7.

So, ngiyabonga ukuthi ngicela ukuthula ngokuthula, ngicela ukuthula ngokuthula ukuthula! (I'm happy to help you with that, and I'll help you with that again!) There would be 7 fish in each pool."	7
246	Jane's makeup artist charged her $250 per hour. For the film she starred in, she required very expensive makeup and it took her 6 hours to do it every day and 4 times a week. The film took 5 weeks to complete. After the film was made, the makeup artist gave Jane a 10% discount for the work done.	27000	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Here's the calculation:

$250 per hour x 6 hours per day x 4 days per week = $6,000 per week
$6,000 per week x 5 weeks = $30,000

With the 10% discount, Jane's total bill would be:
$30,000 - (10% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Ndiyabonga!"	27000

249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister ate. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister ate. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, and the next day 13. How many more calories did Sue eat than her sister, since 1 cookie has 200 calories?	5,600	"Ndi mawu! (I understand!)

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies eaten by Sue: 20 + 26 = 46

Total cookies eaten by her sister: 5 + 13 = 18

Total calories eaten by Sue: 46 x 200 = 9200

Total calories eaten by her sister: 18 x 200 = 3600

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister."	5600
