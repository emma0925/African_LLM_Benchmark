13	Melanie is a door-to-door salesperson. She sold half and a quarter of the vacuum cleaners to the green house, two more to the red house, and the remaining half to the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many to start with?	18	"Moo le maa, Melanie ke lebogang. (Answer: Melanie, let's do the math.)

Melanie sold half (1/2) and a quarter (1/4) of the vacuum cleaners, which is 3/4. She sold 3/4 to the green house.

She sold 2 more to the red house, so that's 3/4 + 2 = 7/4.

The remaining half (1/2) she sold to the orange house.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners x.

We can set up the equation: x - (3/4)x - 2 - (1/2)x = 5

Combine like terms: (1/4)x = 7

Multiply both sides by 4: x = 28

So Melanie started with 28 vacuum cleaners."	28
14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% will learn synchronized dance, the remaining 25% will learn jersey dance, the rest will learn hip-hop dance, What percentage of all students will learn hip-hop dance?	60	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I can help you with that.

20% of 20 students will learn synchronized dance, which is 4 students. The remaining 16 students will learn either jersey dance (25% of 20) or hip-hop dance. 25% of 20 is 5 students, so 5 students will learn jersey dance. The rest, 11 students, will learn hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who will learn hip-hop dance, divide the number of students who will learn hip-hop dance (11) by the total number of students (20), and multiply by 100:

(11 ÷ 20) x 100 = 55%

So, 55% of all students will learn hip-hop dance. Ngiyabonga!"	55
15	The seller wants to choose between two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8000. His financial advisor sees that the jewelry market will rise 2.5% while the electronics market will rise 1.2% in the same month. If the seller wants to increase profits at the end of the month with his decision, what will be the profit?	125	"Ndi ndi! (Ahah! Let me think)

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Jewelry market will rise 2.5%, so the value will increase to $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Electronics market will rise 1.2%, so the value will increase to $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Conclusion: Electronics worth $8,000 will give a higher profit of $96 compared to jewelry worth $5,000, which will give a profit of $125."	125

20	I have 10 quarts of orange juice and I want to add 15 quarts of pineapple juice. But when I poured them, I spilled 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Ah, ngikhuluma ngicela ukuthi... (Let me calculate...)

First, let's combine the orange juice and pineapple juice: 10 quarts (orange juice) + 15 quarts (pineapple juice) = 25 quarts.

Since 1 liter is equal to 0.25 quarts, the amount of orange juice spilled is: 1 liter = 0.25 quarts.

So, subtract the spilled orange juice from the total orange juice: 10 quarts - 0.25 quarts = 9.75 quarts.

Now, add the pineapple juice to the remaining orange juice: 9.75 quarts (orange juice) + 15 quarts (pineapple juice) = 24.75 quarts.

Finally, convert the total quarts to liters: 24.75 quarts ≈ 19.31 liters.

So, ngicela ukuthi... (I think...) there are approximately 19.31 liters of juice left. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	19

40	Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. If Suzy's iPhone is one year older, how old is Brandon's iPhone?	8	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Suzy's iPhone is x years old.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old, so it's 2x years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so it's 4(2x) = 8x years old.

Since Suzy's iPhone is one year older, x = x + 1. So, x = 1.

Brandon's iPhone is 8x = 8(1) = 8 years old.

41	The great dragon Perg, sitting high on the summit of the mountain Farbo, breathed fire on everything within 1000 yards. Polly could throw a golden javelin, a well-known weapon that could cut a dragon, at a distance of 400 yards, but at the end of the dragon's flame. But while Polly was holding the stone, she could throw the javelin three times farther if she did not catch the stone. If you hold the stone, how far is it to reach the flame of the dragon Polly is standing and again hit the dragons with the javelin's gold?	200	"Ndi nku! (I understand!)

Polly can throw the javelin 400 yards, but at the end of the dragon's flame. If she doesn't hold the stone, she can throw it 3 times farther, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 yards. So, she can reach the dragon's flame at 1200 yards.

Now, if she holds the stone, she can only throw the javelin 400 yards. But she needs to reach the dragon's flame again, which is 1000 yards away. So, she needs to throw the javelin 1000 - 400 = 600 yards to reach the flame again.

Ndi ndi! (I've got it!)

Answer: 600 yards."	600

44	Charlie wants to sell honey cake candles. For every pound of honey cake he can make 10 candles. A pound of honey cake and string can cost $10 to the vendors. If he sells each candle for $2.00 what is the direct profit if he sells 20 candles?	20	"Moo nna, Charlie a yaa kɔmɔlɛ. (My answer is, Charlie will gain.)

To find the direct profit, first, calculate the cost of making 20 candles:

1 pound of honey cake makes 10 candles, so to make 20 candles, Charlie needs 2 pounds of honey cake (20/10 = 2).

The cost of 2 pounds of honey cake and string is $10.

Now, calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:

Each candle sells for $2.00, so 20 candles sell for $40.00.

The direct profit is the revenue minus the cost:

$40.00 (revenue) - $10.00 (cost) = $30.00

Moo nna, Charlie a yaa kɔmɔlɛ $30.00. (Charlie will gain $30.00.)"	30
45	Meredith is a freelance writer who writes about health topics and delivers them to clients every day as part of her job. A topic takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Monday. On Wednesday she wrote twice as many papers as she wrote on Tuesday. Count the total number of hours she spent writing papers in three days.	104	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Meredith spent 4 hours researching and writing each article. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles, so that's 4 hours x 5 articles = 20 hours. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 as many articles as she did on Monday, which is 5 x 2/5 = 2 articles. So that's 4 hours x 2 articles = 8 hours. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 articles. So that's 4 hours x 4 articles = 16 hours. In total, she spent 20 hours + 8 hours + 16 hours = 44 hours.	44

Candice started with 80 note stickers. She put 220 note stickers in cups of coffee. That's 80 + 220 = 300 note stickers. Since she had 23 note stickers left, she must have used 300 - 23 = 277 note stickers. She bought note stickers in a pack, so we need to find the number of note stickers in that pack. Let's call it x. Since she used 277 note stickers, we can set up the equation: x + 80 = 277. To solve for x, subtract 80 from both sides: x = 277 - 80 = 197. Ndiyakuthanda! (I like that!) Candice bought 197 note stickers in that pack."	197
47	John buys twice as many red ties as green ties. Red ties cost 50% more than green ties. He spent $200 on green ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the tie?	800	"Ngiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Since John spent $200 on green ties that cost $40 each, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 green ties.

Since he buys twice as many red ties as green ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of green ties is $40 each, so the total cost of green ties is 5 x $40 = $200.

The cost of red ties is 50% more than green ties, so the cost of red ties is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 x $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (for green ties) + $600 (for red ties) = $800.

57	A wooden bridge can carry more than 5,000 pounds. A truck carrying a load of identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the trailer and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes of maximum value can be loaded onto the truck before it exceeds the weight limit of the bridge?	83	"Moo naa, eeh! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

The combined weight of the truck and trailer is 3,755 pounds. Add the weight of the boxes (15 pounds each). The maximum weight limit of the bridge is 5,000 pounds. Subtract the combined weight of the truck and trailer from the maximum weight limit: 5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box: 1,245 ÷ 15 = 82.5 boxes. Since you can't load a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 82."	82

She has driven 100 miles for the last fill-up and needs to put in 4 gallons of gas for the next fill-up. Her owner's manual says that her gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive with one gas tank?	300	"Nǐ wà shén me? (What's the matter?) Ah, Sophia wants to know how far she can drive with one gas tank? Hmmm... Let me calculate for you! 

If Sophia has driven 100 miles already and needs to put in 4 gallons for the next fill-up, that means she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank. According to her owner's manual, her car gets 3 miles per gallon. So, with 8 gallons left, she can drive 8 x 3 = 24 miles more. Add that to the 100 miles she's already driven, and she can drive a total of 100 + 24 = 124 miles with one gas tank!

93	Lee was able to run the 40-meter hurdles in two minutes faster than Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his eating habits, which increased his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 minutes, how fast can Gerald, having changed his eating habits, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	Hamba kahle! Lee ran the 40-meter hurdles in 2 minutes faster than Gerald, so Gerald took 2 minutes + 38 minutes = 40 minutes. Gerald's speed increased by 10%, so his new time is 40 minutes - 10% of 40 minutes = 36 minutes. 36 minutes is 2160 seconds.	2160

95	Of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are girl scouts. How many girls are not in the scouts?	40	"Kwaku, 2/5 of the boys are girl scouts. Since there are 200 students, there are 200/5 = 40 boys. 2/5 of 40 is 16. So 16 boys are girl scouts.

2/3 of the girls are girl scouts. Since there are 200 students, there are 200 - 40 = 160 girls. 2/3 of 160 is 106. So 106 girls are girl scouts.

There are 160 girls, and 106 are girl scouts, so 160 - 106 = 54 girls are not girl scouts."	54

98	Cars are lined up on the road. Some cars drive past the traffic jam in 15 minutes, and 20 cars drive past the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. 5 cars in the line have pulled out to avoid the traffic jam. If there were 30 cars on the road, how many cars were driven past the traffic jam in 15 minutes?	5	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!) 

Let's break it down:

There were 30 cars initially.
5 cars left to avoid the traffic jam, so we subtract 5 from 30: 30 - 5 = 25
The remaining 25 cars are divided into two groups: those that drove past the traffic jam in 15 minutes and those that drove past in the remaining 15 minutes.
20 cars drove past in the remaining 15 minutes, so the remaining cars that drove past in the initial 15 minutes are: 25 - 20 = 5

So, 5 cars drove past the traffic jam in 15 minutes!"	15

Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180 

Now, calculate the total revenue: 
10 x $10 = $100 (for the 2x4x10 boards) 
5 x $16 = $80 (for the 4x4x10 boards) 
Total revenue: $100 + $80 = $180

Morisette brought back 5 apples and 8 oranges, so that's 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought back 2.5 times as many apples as Morisette, so that's 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 apples. Since you can't have half an apple, we'll round it up to 13 apples. Kael also brought back some oranges, but we don't know how many. Let's assume he brought back the same number as Morisette, which is 8. So Kael brought back 13 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 13 + 8 = 21 fruits.

129	The clinic sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the clinic and at the clinic patients charge $200 an hour. How much profit does the clinic make from visits?	10000	"Moo na kwa! (Let me calculate!)

The clinic sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, so the total time spent by doctors is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent by doctors is 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours.

Doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total revenue from doctor's time is 200 x $150 = $30,000.

Patients charge $200 an hour, so the total revenue from patient's time is 200 x $200 = $40,000.

The total revenue is $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Since there is no cost mentioned, the profit is the total revenue, which is $70,000.

138	Mark wrote a questionnaire yesterday which had 75 questions. He finished the questionnaire in a hurry which indicates that he answered 5 questions in an hour. Today, he wrote another questionnaire with 100 questions in the same way. If Mark had 8 hours to finish the questionnaire and 6 hours to finish the second one, how many questions did he leave unanswered?	105	"Oya! (Okay!) Let me calculate this for you.

For the first questionnaire, Mark answered 5 questions in an hour. Since he has 8 hours, he can answer 5 x 8 = 40 questions.

For the second questionnaire, Mark can answer 5 x 6 = 30 questions in 6 hours.

For the first questionnaire, Mark has 75 - 40 = 35 unanswered questions.
For the second questionnaire, Mark has 100 - 30 = 70 unanswered questions.

In total, Mark has 35 + 70 = 105 unanswered questions."	105

Kwa kuwa vifaa vya kuua wadudu ni vifaa vya kazi, John akapima taxi 10%. Kwa hiyo, John akapima $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $11 kwa chakula, na $4 + $4 (tax) = $8 kwa vifaa vya kuua wadudu. Kwa hiyo, John akapima $11 + $8 = $19.	19
144	Kim has already started his housecleaning business and calculated how much profit he will make for his people. He still has 3 people, but he is talking to five potential people and feels completely confident to include them in his calculations. Each of his people's homes will need 2 bottles of bleach and a good cleaning cloth. The bleach bottles cost $2 each and the cloths will cost $5 each. Those are his expenses. He calculates that his salary for one week is $92. The profit is the difference between the salary and all the expenses, so what is the profit, in dollars, would Lucasou make each week?	20	"Kwaku, Lucasou na yɛn nyinaa! (Lucasou, let's calculate this!)

Lucasou has 3 people already, and he's talking to 5 more potential people, making a total of 8 people.

Each person's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a cleaning cloth. So, the total number of bleach bottles needed is 2 x 8 = 16, and the total number of cloths needed is 8.

The cost of bleach bottles is 16 x $2 = $32, and the cost of cloths is 8 x $5 = $40. The total expense is $32 + $40 = $72.

Lucasou's salary is $92. To find the profit, subtract the total expense from the salary:

$92 - $72 = $20

So, Lucasou's profit would be $20 per week."	20

Steve lives 3 miles away from school and the bike is 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Steve's distance = 3 miles = 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 1760 feet)
Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed = 5280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes

Tim's distance = 2 miles = 3520 feet
Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed = 3520 feet / 264 feet/minute = 13.3 minutes

How many fried potatoes were in the bag that Dave bought?	48	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (Hello! How are you?)

Let's calculate the number of fried potatoes:

Dave ate 14, the seagull smashed 7 (half of 14), the pigeons ate 9 (3 x 3), and the raccoon stole 10 (2/3 of 14). That leaves 5 fried potatoes.

So, the original number of fried potatoes was 14 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 5 = 45.

Kgale ke kgale, let's calculate! (K-gah-leh keh k-gah-leh, leh-t's kah-kuh-lyoo-tay!) 

Each roll is 4 inches, so 300 rolls is 300 x 4 = 1200 inches. 

Each croissant is 6 inches, so 120 croissants is 120 x 6 = 720 inches. 

Each baguette is 2 feet, so 60 baguettes is 60 x 2 = 120 feet. 

Total length: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 120 feet = 1200 + 720 + 144 = 2064 inches. 

2064 inches is equal to 172 feet.

A doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so a doll costs 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.

A red car costs 4 dollars.

Total value of toys: 5 red cars = 5 x 4 = 20 dollars
+ 3 action figures = 15 dollars
+ 1 doll = 15 dollars
Total value = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 dollars

So, the total value of the toys is 50 dollars, which is equal to 10 action figures."	10

166	Sandra's neighbors give her nine baskets of eggs every time she babysits. To make Spanish flan, she needs three eggs. If Sandra is asked to make 15 Spanish flan for school money, how many times must Sandra babysit?	5	"Wena, Sandra ke nako e ba tsamaya hantle! (Ah, Sandra, she must babysit many times!)

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Since Sandra needs 5 Spanish flan, she needs 5 x 3 = 15 eggs. Since she gets 9 baskets of eggs each time she babysits, she needs to babysit:

15 ÷ 9 = 1.67 (round up to 2, since you can't babysit a fraction of a time!)

So, Sandra must babysit 2 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flan."	15

172	There are 4 birds in Caboose. Sally the second is three years older than Grandma Red. Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally the fourth. If Sally the fourth is thirty-two years old, and Sally the twenty-second is eight years old, how many of the four birds are young?	51	"Kwaku, nna wo ne yɛ! (Ah, my friend, I'll answer!) 

Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally the fourth, so Grandma Red is 32 x 2 = 64 years old. Sally the second is three years older than Grandma Red, so Sally the second is 64 + 3 = 67 years old. 

Since Sally the second is 67 years old and Sally the twenty-second is 8 years old, we can conclude that Sally the second and Sally the twenty-second are not young. 

So, only two birds, Sally the fourth and Sally the second, are not young."	8
173	Jessica tries to figure out how much she pays monthly on each bill. The mortgage has a starting balance of $300 a month, her credit card has a balance of $200 a month, and a starting balance of $500 a month for buying and maintaining property. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this, how much does she pay per year?	18000	"Moo sika! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

Jessica pays:

* Mortgage: $300 + 50% of $300 = $450 per month
* Credit card: $200 + 50% of $200 = $300 per month
* Property: $500 + 50% of $500 = $750 per month

Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1,500

Per year: $1,500 x 12 = $18,000"	18000
174	Billy peels the potatoes and grinds them in preparation for making a potato salad for his large family at a barbecue party. The big event, he has 60 potatoes to finish. The potatoes are the same size, it takes the same time to peel and grind each one. It takes Billy a minute and a half to peel, but it is 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take him to prepare the potatoes ?	95	"Kulani, ukuthetha ingxaki! (Ah, let me calculate this!)

It takes Billy 1 minute and 30 seconds (90 seconds) to peel one potato. Since he has 60 potatoes, it will take him:

60 potatoes x 90 seconds/potato = 5400 seconds

to peel all the potatoes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to grind one potato. Since he has 60 potatoes, it will take him:

60 potatoes x 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds

to grind all the potatoes.

In total, it will take Billy:

5400 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (grinding) = 5700 seconds

to prepare all the potatoes.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice, each lemon they make for $3 of lemon and sugar and $2 of sugar. They sell one glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses from one jar. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemonade?	15	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungenisa isimo esingqinile. (Goodbye! Thank you for the clever question.)

Let's break it down:

* Cost of lemon and sugar per lemon: $3
* Cost of sugar per lemon: $2
* Total cost per lemon: $3 + $2 = $5
* Number of lemons in a jar: 20
* Total cost per jar: $5 x 20 = $100
* Revenue per jar: $0.50 x 20 = $10
* Profit per jar: $10 - $100 = -$90 (wait, this can't be right!)
* Profit: $25
* Number of jars: $25 / $10 = 2.5 (round up to 3, since you can't sell a fraction of a jar)
* Total cost: $100 x 3 = $300

So, Juan and Carlos spent $300 on lemonade."	300

If Zaid receives $6000 a month, how much will he have left after these expenses and donations?	350	"Kwaku, ntama nante! (Let me calculate, my friend!)

Zaid spends 1/4 of his income on rent, which is $1500 (1/4 of $6000).
He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is $2000 (1/3 of $6000).
He gives the other half, which is $3000 (half of $6000).

Total expenses: $1500 + $2000 + $3000 = $6500

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so total donations are $900.

Total expenses and donations: $6500 + $900 = $7400

Zaid has $6000 income, so he will have left:

Mice: 3 cages, each with equal groups. Each mouse gets 6 pieces of grass. So, 6 x? = 18.? = 3. Each cage has 3 mice. 3 x 3 = 9 mice per cage. 9 mice per cage, 3 cages, so 9 x 3 = 27 mice. 27 mice, each gets 6 pieces of grass, so 27 x 6 = 162 pieces of grass for the mice.

Hamsters: 10 cages, each hamster gets 5 pieces of grass. So, 5 x? = 50.? = 10. 10 hamsters per cage, 10 cages, so 10 x 10 = 100 hamsters. 100 hamsters, each gets 5 pieces of grass, so 100 x 5 = 500 pieces of grass for the hamsters.

Rabbits: 20 pieces of grass are distributed among the rabbits.

189	Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 round-trip tickets. They also spent less than $4.50 on food and tickets. They also traveled to two different places that cost $33 each. If they agreed to split the price equally, how much did each person pay?	34	"Moo-oo-oo! (That's ""Okay, let me calculate that for you!"")

The total cost of the round-trip tickets is $20.25. Since there are 3 tickets, the cost per ticket is $20.25 ÷ 3 = $6.75 per ticket.

The cost of food and tickets is less than $4.50, so let's assume it's $4.00. The total cost so far is $20.25 + $4.00 = $24.25.

The cost of traveling to two different places is $33 each, so the total cost is $33 × 2 = $66.00. Adding this to the previous total, we get $24.25 + $66.00 = $90.25.

Since there are 3 friends, the total amount each person needs to pay is $90.25 ÷ 3 = $30.08.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years, he will have 50 + 10*10 = 150 trees. But he cuts down 2 trees a year, so after 10 years, he will have 150 - 2*10 = 130 trees.

Then, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 is 0.3*130 = 39. So, Tom is left with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Let's calculate the total weight of carrots distributed: 200 pounds = 90.72 kilograms (1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms)

Each restaurant receives 2 kilograms, so the total amount of carrots distributed is: 40 restaurants × 2 kilograms = 80 kilograms

Now, let's subtract the used carrots from the total amount: 90.72 kilograms - 80 kilograms = 10.72 kilograms

So, 10.72 kilograms of carrots will not be used."	10

199	Mark is a copy editor. He schedules an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, each paying him a different price for each sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark schedules a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make per week, in cents?	7500	"Moo nkhono! (Let me calculate!) 

Since Mark schedules an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's say x is the number of sentences for each publisher. Since the total number of sentences is 1000, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence (twice as much). So, Mark makes:

Publisher A: 500 sentences x 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
Publisher B: 500 sentences x 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings per week: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

Baldur gets 5 pears of water every morning and 6 pears every afternoon. That's a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pears of water per day.

If he made $2000 a week, every week of the year and received a medal on the first day of the year how much would he have made that year?	114,200	"Habari gani? (What's the news?) Ah, John wins a prize! Mzuri sana! (Very good!) Let me calculate...

First, the one-time cash award of $5000. That's a nice bonus!

Second, the 5% salary increase. Ah, that's a nice raise! So, his weekly salary increases to:

$2000 x 1.05 = $2100 per week

Now, let's calculate his total salary for the year:

$2100 per week x 52 weeks per year = $109,200 per year

Adding the one-time cash award of $5000, his total salary for the year becomes:

$109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

And, of course, he received a medal on the first day of the year, which is a nice keepsake!

Habari gani? (What's the news?) John's salary increased, and he received a nice prize!"	114200

203	Carl's favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days a week using 1 slice of each omelet instead of 1 slice of each sandwich. He made a large macaroni and cheese dish to save him several dinners a week and used 8 slices of cheese on it. Did you use slices of cheese?	31	Sawubona! (Hello!) Ah, Carl used 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches, 3 slices of cheese for omelets, and 8 slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese. That's a total of 25 slices of cheese! (Ngiyabonga!)	25
204	Janet had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 bags of green pencils and 2 bags of red pencils. There were 9 pencils in each blue bag and 6 pencils in each red bag. How many pencils does Janet have now?	98	Janetu waka 22+10 = 32 pencils. Waka 6 bags of green pencils, Janetu waka 6 x 9 = 54. Waka 2 bags of red pencils, Janetu waka 2 x 6 = 12. Janetu waka 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pencils.	98
205	If Brinley scores 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does he need on the sixth test to get a score of 93?	98	"Hamba kahle! Ndiyakuthanda ukuba ngisithandi isimo. (Goodbye! I love to calculate scores.)

Brinley's total score so far is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

To get a total score of 93, Brinley needs a total score of 93 x 6 = 558.

Since he has already scored 438, he needs 558 - 438 = 120 on the sixth test.

Hamba kahle! (Goodbye!)"	120

207	Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 layers of chocolates and 80 candy apples. Each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each candy apple. If each chocolate weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?	2600	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Igama elithandayo: 25 layers of chocolates and 80 candy apples.

Izinto elithandayo: Each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each candy apple, and each chocolate weighs 40g.

Izinto elithandayo: 25 layers of chocolates = 25 x 40g = 1000g
Izinto elithandayo: 80 candy apples = 80 x (40g / 2) = 1600g

Igama elithandayo: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

(I understand!) On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many, which is 4 x 3 = 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times as many as on Tuesday, which is 12 x 5 = 60 cakes. In total, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes. Ndi mboni!	76
209	Twenty-two cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $6,000 each.	145	"Nini! (That's ""How much?"" in Yoruba, a Nigerian language.)

Let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates: 6 plates x $6,000 each = $36,000

The problem states that 22 cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, so:

$36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

This is the cost of the 22 cups."	22
210	Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the shoes each $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, gets paid $5 for each time she hides them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can buy a jacket and shoes?	10	Moo! Sarah yen a kha kele, 2 kha kele taa. Kha kele yen $30, kha kele taa yen $20, kha kele taa yen $20. Sarah yen 5 kha kele taa, yen $5 kha kele taa. Sarah yen 4 kha kele taa, yen $4 kha kele taa. Sarah yen 10 kha kele, yen 10 kha kele. Sarah yen 2 kha kele taa, yen $60 kha kele taa. Sarah yen 30 + 60 = 90. Sarah yen 90 kha kele taa, yen 4 kha kele taa. Sarah yen 90/4 = 22.5. Sarah yen 23 kha kele taa.	23
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two chickens that are whiter than the red ones, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Ndiyo, njia ya kufanya hii hesabu ni kama hii:

Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so let's say Jerry has x red chickens.
White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, and he has 2 white chickens that are whiter than the red ones, so let's say Jerry has y white chickens.

Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5y = 42

We know that y = 2, since he has 2 white chickens. So we can substitute y with 2:

3x + 5(2) = 42

3x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3x = 32

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 10.67

But Jerry can't have a fraction of a chicken, so we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens."	10
212	Gary likes to walk along the edge of the local park, a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

213	While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. The next day, he counted 50 more, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers. On the third day, he counted 500 customers. To find out how many customers he counted on the third day, subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on all three days:

500 (third day) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250

Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day. Ngiyabonga!"	250

Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, and her mother adds half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. To find the total number of minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces they add per minute (6). 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes. To find the number of hours, we can divide the total number of minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour. So, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

239	The number of pupils in the school ward was 1000. The ward had 3 entrances A, B and C for entrance and exit. If more than 30% of the pupils left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B, then the rest left through door C, count the number of pupils who left through door C.	280	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* 30% of 1000 is 300, so more than 300 pupils left through door A.
* 3/5 of 1000 is 600, so 600 pupils left through door B.
* Total pupils who left through door A and B is 300 + 600 = 900.
* Since the total number of pupils is 1000, the number of pupils who left through door C is 1000 - 900 = 100.

So, 100 pupils left through door C. Ndiyakuthandala!"	100

243	Jason has a cell phone schedule of 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes a day to call his boss, and he has had 300 minutes a month to call other people. How many minutes did Jason have left if there are 30 days in the month?	250	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Jason has 1000 minutes a month. He uses 15 minutes a day to call his boss, so that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. He also used 300 minutes to call other people. So, in total, he used 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

He has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left."	250
244	Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took several more than Kyle did. Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries, and Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Kwaku! Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. So Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left. Billy took several more than Kyle did, so Billy took 5 + x fries. Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries, so Ginger gave Griffin x fries. Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did, so Colby gave Griffin 5/3 fries. Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so we can set up the equation:

19 + x + x + 5/3 = 27

Combine like terms:

19 + 2x + 5/3 = 27

Subtract 19 from both sides:

2x + 5/3 = 8

Multiply both sides by 3:

6x + 5 = 24

Subtract 5 from both sides:

6x = 19

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 19/6

x = 3.17

Since you can't give a fraction of a fry, Ginger gave Griffin 3 fries."	3
245	There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. There is a difference in the number of snails in these two aquariums and in the number of fish present in both aquariums.

246	The cost of the makeup artist's jeans is $250 per hour. She needs expensive makeup to make a movie isn't it and it takes six hours to do it a day and she needs to do it four times a week. The movie takes five weeks to finish. After the movie is over the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Nǐ sī, Jean a 10% discount kwa makeup artist's jeans. 

Calculation:

$250 per hour x 6 hours per day = $1500 per day
$1500 per day x 4 days per week = $6000 per week
$6000 per week x 5 weeks = $30,000

10% discount = $30,000 x 0.10 = $3,000

Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000"	27000
247	Isabelle bought supplies for her younger sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on baby gifts. She divided the cost equally between the three of them and the parents. How many dollars did each person spend?	32	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha! (Yes, I can show you!)

Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

Since there are 6 people (3 children and 3 parents), each person will spend:

$96 ÷ 6 = $16

Kwa heri! (Goodbye!)"	16
248	The cook bought 4 bags of onions. One bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions costs $1.50. How much did the cook spend?	300	"Ndi ndi! (I'll calculate!) 

4 bags x 50 pounds per bag = 200 pounds
200 pounds x $1.50 per pound = $300

Ndi ndi! (I've calculated!) The cook spent $300."	300
249	On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue and her sister eat?	5,600	"Moo na keeng! (Let me calculate!)

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cakes as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cakes.
On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cakes as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cakes.

Total cakes eaten by Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cakes
Total cakes eaten by her sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cakes

Total calories eaten by Sue: 46 x 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories

Moo na keeng! (I've calculated!)"	3600
