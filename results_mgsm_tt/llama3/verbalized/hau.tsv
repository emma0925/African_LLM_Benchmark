4	Every day Wendi feeds three cups of raw chicken feed, containing seeds, protein and vegetables for good health. She feeds the chickens three times. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens 25 cups. How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	Kwa nini? (Why not?) Ah, okay! Let me calculate for you. Wendi feeds 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Since she feeds 3 cups three times a day, that's 3 x 3 = 9 cups for each chicken. If she has 20 chickens, she'll need 9 x 20 = 180 cups. But wait! She already fed 40 cups, so she'll need 180 - 40 = 140 cups at the end of the day. Ndiyo! (Yes!)	140

13	Melanie was a door-to-door salesperson. She sold three-quarters of her garbage disposal in the green house, 2 in the red house, half of the remainder in the lemon-water house. If Melanie had 5 garbage disposal machines, how many did she start with?	18	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem. Let's say Melanie started with x garbage disposal machines.

She sold 3/4x machines in the green house, which is 0.75x.

She sold 2 machines in the red house, which is 2.

She sold half of the remainder in the lemon-water house, which is (x - 0.75x - 2)/2 = 0.125x.

The total number of machines sold is 0.75x + 2 + 0.125x = 0.875x + 2.

We know that the total number of machines sold is equal to the total number of machines she started with, which is x.

So, we can set up the equation 0.875x + 2 = x.

Subtracting 0.875x from both sides gives us 2 = 0.125x.

Dividing both sides by 0.125 gives us x = 16.

So, Melanie started with 16 garbage disposal machines. Ngiyabonga!"	16
14	In a dance class of 20, 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest were involved in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

I calculate that 20% of 20 is 4, and 25% of 20 is 5. So, 4 + 5 = 9 students were enrolled in modern and jazz dance. That leaves 20 - 9 = 11 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, I divide 11 by 20 and multiply by 100, which gives me 55%. 

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	55
15	A businessman wants to make a purchase choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will rise by 2.5 percent while the electronics market will rise by 1.2 percent this month. If the businessman is looking to increase his profit margin at the end of this month by making a choice, what is this profit margin?	125	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) 

If he buys jewelry, it will be worth $5,000 + 2.5% of $5,000 = $5,125. His profit will be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

If he buys electronics, it will be worth $8,000 + 1.2% of $8,000 = $8,064. His profit will be $8,064 - $8,000 = $64.

The profit margin is the profit divided by the cost, expressed as a percentage. For jewelry, the profit margin is ($125 / $5,000) x 100% = 2.5%. For electronics, the profit margin is ($64 / $8,000) x 100% = 0.8%.

So, the businessman should choose the jewelry to increase his profit margin."	0

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what would her annual salary be?	57500	"Kwaku, kwa kwa! (That's 50 weeks, my friend!) 

50 weeks * 35 hours/week = 1750 hours (as a teacher)
50 weeks * 15 hours/week = 750 hours (as a coach)
Total hours worked per year = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours

Annual salary = 2500 hours * (average hourly wage, let's assume $50) = $125,000"	125000
18	Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast. How many dozen can she eat in 4 weeks?	7	Ndi mawu!

21	Raymond and Samantha are blood brothers. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son aged 23. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how long ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!)

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 37 years old (31 + 6).

Raymond's son is 23 years old, so Raymond's son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago."	14

29	Gloria went shoe shopping when she came across a pair of sauciki shoes that fit her shoe budget. However, she had to choose between a sauciki and two polished shoes that together cost five dollars less than the cost of a sauciki. If one polished shoe cost $33 and one polished shoe cost twice as much, how much was the sauciki?	104	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha! (Yes, I can show you!)

Let's break it down:

* One polished shoe costs $33.
* The other polished shoe costs twice as much, so it costs $33 x 2 = $66.
* Together, the two polished shoes cost $33 + $66 = $99.
* The question states that the polished shoes cost $5 less than the sauciki, so the sauciki costs $99 + $5 = $104.

Therefore, the sauciki costs $104."	104

31	Gunter is trying to count the beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many beans they think there will be in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. The third says 25% more than the first half. What is their average guess?	80	"Nǐn wèi, Gunter! (You want to know, Gunter!)

Let's calculate the average guess:

1. The first friend says 80 beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 40 (since 80/2 = 40). So, the second friend says 40 + 20 = 60 beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 10 (since 80/2 = 40 and 25% of 40 is 10). So, the third friend says 40 + 10 = 50 beans.

The average guess is: (80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33

So, the average guess is approximately 63 beans."	63

52	Uriah's book bag was heavy. He had to remove 15 pounds of it. His comic books weighed a quarter of a pound each and his toys weighed a half pound each. If he collected 30 comic books, how many children's toys did he need to remove?	15	Wena ukuthi Uriah's book bag was heavy, ke? Uriah had to remove 15 pounds of it. Comic books weighed a quarter of a pound each and his toys weighed a half pound each. If he collected 30 comic books, that's 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds. So, he had 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds left to remove. Since toys weigh a half pound each, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. Uriah needs to remove 15 children's toys.	15

The top level has 16 squares. Since each level has half the square of the level below, we can calculate the number of squares for each level:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16/2 = 8
Level 3: 8/2 = 4
Level 4: 4/2 = 2
Level 5: 2/2 = 1

To find the average, we add up the number of squares for each level and divide by the total number of levels:

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31

There are 5 levels. To find the average, divide the sum by 5:

31 ÷ 5 = 6.2

So, the average level of one square is 6.2."	6

Each tishat has a different type of area, and each row on the knife is sewn with the areas of the tishat he has from different ages. Therefore, the total number of areas is the total number of rows on the knife, which is equal to the total number of vacations Gene has taken, which is 44.

So, Gene has 44 areas in total."	44
86	Greg has an alarm set to go off three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it keeps ringing until Greg turns it off. The first time it goes off today, it rings four times. The second time it goes off, it rings three times as much as the first time. The third time, it rings for half the time it rings the second time. How many times does the alarm go off all at once?	22	"Kwaku, kofi nua! (That's the answer, my friend!) 

First time: 4 times

88	Marilyn's first record sold for 10 cents more than Harald's, so if 88,000 copies were sold, how many copies did Harald sell?	8000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Harald's record sold for x cents, and Marilyn's record sold for x + 10 cents. Let's say the total number of copies sold is 88,000. We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 10) = 88,000

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 88,000

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 87,990

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 43,995

So Harald's record sold for 43,995 cents, which is 43,995 copies."	43995

97	When Freda cooks canned tomatoes in the sauce, they lose half their size. Each of the 16 cans of tomatoes she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda's last tomato sauce weighed 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuba ngicela! (I love helping!)

Let's break it down:

Each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, and there are 16 cans. So, the total number of tomatoes is:
3 tomatoes/can × 16 cans = 48 tomatoes

When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes, they lose half their size, which means the number of tomatoes is halved. So, the number of tomatoes used is:
48 tomatoes ÷ 2 = 24 tomatoes

Freda's last tomato sauce weighed 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from cooked tomatoes, we can assume the weight of the sauce is proportional to the number of tomatoes used. Therefore, the number of tomatoes used is:
24 tomatoes

110	Marcell and Beatrice compete to see who can eat the most rol-op, so they open as many as they can get. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake, Beatrice's rol-op is two inches wide and 24 inches long while Marcell's is 3 inches wide and 14 inches tall. If they ate all together, what was the average amount they ate?	45	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ungenisa isimo. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking the question.)

To find the average amount they ate, we need to find the total amount of rol-op they ate and then divide it by the number of rol-op they ate.

Beatrice's rol-op is 2 inches wide and 24 inches long, so its area is 2 x 24 = 48 square inches.

Marcell's rol-op is 3 inches wide and 14 inches long, so its area is 3 x 14 = 42 square inches.

Together, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 square inches of rol-op.

Since they ate 2 rol-op, the average amount they ate is 90 / 2 = 45 square inches per rol-op.

In inches, the average amount they ate is 45 / 12 = 3.75 inches per rol-op.

Let's calculate the water leaked by the shell:

* The shell takes 16 seconds to sail 20 feet, so it takes 64 seconds to sail 80 feet (20 x 4) to reach shore.
* The shell takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it sails, so it takes 8 liters of water for every 40 feet (10 x 4) it sails.
* Since it sails 80 feet to reach shore, it takes 16 liters of water (8 x 2).

So, the shell leaked 16 liters of water when Julia reached the shore."	16

(Thank you!) 

Igama eli: Profit ezingeni. (The name is: Profit calculation.)

Ngoku, Sasha yenza i-wood yini? (So, Sasha bought the wood how much?)

Ngoku, i-wood yini $20 + (50% * $20) = $30. (So, the wood cost $20 + (50% * $20) = $30.)

Ngoku, Sasha yenza i-wood yini 15. (So, Sasha bought the wood for $15.)

Ngoku, Sasha yenza i-boards yini? (So, Sasha has the boards how many?)

Ngoku, i-boards yini 10 + 5 = 15. (So, Sasha has 10 + 5 = 15 boards.)

Ngoku, Sasha yenza i-boards yini $10 * 10 + $16 * 5 = $100 + $80 = $180. (So, Sasha sold the boards for $10 * 10 + $16 * 5 = $100 + $80 = $180.)

Ngoku, Sasha yenza i-profit yini $180 - $15 = $165. (So, Sasha made a profit of $180 - $15 = $165.)

Igama eli: Sasha yenza i-profit ezingeni $165. (The name is: Sasha made a profit of $165.)"	165

If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary they both receive after the next years?	95200	"Wena ukuthula! (How are you?)

Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40000
Adrien's salary increase: 30%
Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40000 + (30% of $40000) = $52000

Adrien's salary increase again: 40%
Adrien's salary now: $52000 + (40% of $52000) = $72800

Lylah's salary is 30% less than Adrien's: $52000 - (30% of $52000) = $36400

Adrien's salary now: $72800
Lylah's salary now: $36400

Total salary: $72800 + $36400 = $109200

* The price of the pepper is $15.
* The price of the pepper is three times that of the pepper, so the price of the pepper is $15 ÷ 3 = $5.
* The price of the pepper is less than 5 times the price of the melon, so let's call the price of the melon x. Then, the price of the pepper is less than 5x, so it's 5x - ε (where ε is a small positive value). Since the price of the pepper is $5, we can set up the equation: 5x - ε = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 1 + ε/5.
* The total cost is the sum of the costs of the melons, peppers, and oranges: 4x + 20(5) + 10(15) = 4(1 + ε/5) + 100 + 150 = 4 + 4ε/5 + 250 = 254 + 4ε/5.
* Since ε is a small positive value, the total cost is approximately 254 + 4ε/5.

So, the total cost would be approximately $254.20."	254
129	The hospital sees about 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges 200 dollars an hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?	10000	Ndi ndi! (Ahah, listen!) The hospital sees 500 patients a day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent by doctors is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, that is 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour, so the total cost is 200 x 150 = 30,000 dollars. The hospital charges 200 dollars an hour, so the total revenue is 200 x 200 = 40,000 dollars. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 dollars. Ndi ndi! (Ahah, that's it!)	10000
130	Nissa hires 60 employees to play the elves in her Santa's village shop. Three-quarters of the elves quit after children threw up on them, and 10 percent of the remaining elves quit after the children died. How many elves are left?	30	"Kwaku, nnaa! (Okay, let me calculate!) 

60 employees initially. Three-quarters quit, so that's 60 x 0.75 = 45 elves who quit. Remaining elves are 60 - 45 = 15. 10% of 15 elves quit, so that's 15 x 0.1 = 1.5 elves. Since you can't have half an elf, I'll round down to 1 elf. So, 15 - 1 = 14 elves are left."	14
131	In May, Joseph's expenses were $500; by June, they had dropped to $60.	940	Ndiyo, Joseph's expenses zina ukubwa wa $500 mwezi wa Mayi, na zina ukubwa wa $60 mwezi wa Juni.	60
132	Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred four times, and then each decided to ride the sled twice. If each sled cost six tickets, how many tickets were used that day?	60	Ndi nyalani! (I understand!) Pam and Fred used 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10 times the roller coaster and sled. Each sled cost 6 tickets, so they used 10 x 6 = 60 tickets.	60
133	Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, Tuesday, 6 times the distance he walked on Monday. His total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, and 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. So, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday. Since his total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles, he walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.	13
134	Tom goes to his car wash four times a month. If each car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?	720	Ngiyakuthetha! (I'll answer!) Tom pays $15 per car wash, and he goes 4 times a month. That's $15 x 4 = $60 per month. In a year, he pays 12 x $60 = $720. Ngiyakuthetha!	720
135	Brian's friend Bobby has 3 video game gems instead of 5 as much as Brian has. If Brian has 20 video gems but suddenly loses 5 of them before comparison, how much does Bobby have?	40	Kwaku, Bobby na 3 video game gems. Brian na 20 video gems, but lose 5, so Brian na 20 - 5 = 15 video gems. Bobby na 3, Brian na 15, so Bobby na 3/15 = 1/5 of Brian's video gems.	5
136	There are only 27 horseshoes left in the world. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish horseshoes are female. How many female horseshoes are there in Scotland?	6	"Kwaku! (That's ""Okay!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language)

Let's break it down:

1/3 of the 27 horseshoes are in the Scottish Highlands, so there are:

27 x 1/3 = 9 horseshoes in the Scottish Highlands

Two-thirds of the Scottish horseshoes are female, so the number of female horseshoes in Scotland is:

9 x 2/3 = 6 female horseshoes in Scotland

So, Kwaku! There are 6 female horseshoes in Scotland."	6
137	Rory ordered 2 cupcakes for $7.50 each, 2 sacks of potatoes for $1.50 each and 2 biscuits for $1.00 each as a delivery charge. There is a 20% delivery charge on the bill and she would like an additional $5.00. What is the cost of her order?	29	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Here's the calculation:

Cupcakes: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Potatoes: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
Biscuits: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total before delivery charge: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Delivery charge: 20% of $20.00 = $4.00
Additional charge: $5.00
Total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00"	29
138	Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today he took another test with 100 questions similar to his time yesterday. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he have left to complete?	105	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Mark completed 75 questions in 8 hours, which is 75 / 8 = 9.375 questions per hour. He had 5 questions per hour, so he had 4.375 hours of unfinished work, which is 4.375 * 5 = 21.875 questions left.

For the second test, Mark completed 100 questions in 6 hours, which is 100 / 6 = 16.67 questions per hour. He had 6 hours to complete the test, so he had 0 questions left.

Answer: 21.875 questions."	21

144	Kim started a housekeeping business and calculated how much profit he would make from his customers. He has 3 customers now, but he is talking to 5 other potential customers and feels strongly about getting them to include them in his calculations. The house of each customer would need 2 bottles of detergent and a foam area to clean one house. The bottles of detergent would cost $2 each, and the foam area would cost $5 each. These were the only costs he would have. He calculated that the total income per week would be $92.	20	Ndiyo, Kim anaona kuwa atajiriwa $92 kwa wiki. Lakini anaona kuwa atajiriwa zaidi kwa kuwa anaongea na wengine 5. Kwa sasa ana wateja 3, lakini anaona kuwa atajiriwa zaidi kwa kuwa atajiriwa na wengine.	3
145	John has 10 hectares of banana plantation. There are 100 bananas per hectare. John can harvest bananas every 3 months. How many bananas can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!) 

John has 10 hectares of banana plantation. Each hectare has 100 bananas. So, in total, John has 10 x 100 = 1000 bananas per harvest.

John harvests every 3 months, which means he harvests 4 times a year (since there are 12 months in a year, and 12 ÷ 3 = 4).

So, John can harvest 1000 bananas x 4 = 4000 bananas in a year."	4000
146	Johnny is picking up toys in the middle of his living room. He throws a box of 500 legos on the floor, another one with 3 more than 500 pieces in one, and another one with 1/4 the number. How many bricks does Johnny carry if he picks up all the legos?	2,125	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) Okay, let's count those legos!

First box: 500 legos
Second box: 500 + 3 = 503 legos
Third box: 500 / 4 = 125 legos

Total legos: 500 + 503 + 125 = 1128 legos

Johnny carries 1128 legos! Ndiyakuthandile!"	1128
147	Debra monitors the hive to see how many bees come and go during the day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then sees 1/2 of the many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as she first saw leave the hive, from the hive and leave it in the next 6 hours. Then all the bees she left behind that had not yet returned return in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

I calculate that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 30/2 = 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. Then, 2 x 30 = 60 bees left the hive in the next 6 hours. Finally, all the remaining bees (30 - 15 = 15) returned in the last 6 hours. So, Debra saw 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours. Ndiyabonga!"	6
148	Brittany and her mother used to go to the museum. Admission was $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gave the cashier one child's ticket and one adult's ticket. If she found $8 change, how much in dollar bills would she give the cashier?	30	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Mama Brittany ngoku yithola $12 + $10 = $22. Ngoku yithola $8, ngoku yibonga $22 - $8 = $14. Mama Brittany ngoku yibonga $14. (Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14.)"	14
149	Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many Facebook friends does James have?	16	Hamba kahle! Charlie eka 12, Dorothy eka 12 ÷ 3 = 4, James eka 4 x 12 = 48.	48
150	Steve and Tim decided to see who could get home from school faster. Steve lives three miles from the school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives two miles from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes his race?	4	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let's calculate!)

Steve's distance is 3 miles = 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 1760 feet). He rides at 440 feet per minute, so:

Time = Distance / Speed = 5280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles = 3520 feet. He rides at 264 feet per minute, so:

Time = Distance / Speed = 3520 feet / 264 feet/minute = 13.3 minutes

Steve finishes first, so he will wait for Tim at home for:

13.3 minutes - 12 minutes = 1.3 minutes

Wena, ukuthetha! (That's it! The answer is 1.3 minutes.)"	1
151	Shawnda decides that the kids in her neighborhood can use the bicycle service. She decides the best way to charge is by pressing air tires. Each tire costs 25 cents to do the service. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles come to be pressed on two tires. 3 people come to keep their tires pressed to adjust their speed. Finally, one person comes on a motorcycle. How many dollars did she make that day?	5	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Shawnda made $1.25 that day.	1
152	Carl bought ten packs of biscuits. Each packet had six biscuits in it. Each pack of biscuits cost $0.10. How much change would Carl get if he paid $10?	4	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Carl bought 10 packs of biscuits, each with 6 biscuits. So he bought 10 x 6 = 60 biscuits. Each pack cost $0.10, so the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6. If he paid $10, he would get $4 in change. Ngiyabonga!	4
153	Dave bought a giant french fries, eating fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. When the seagull landed, it spilled half of the amount of french fries Dave had eaten. Three pigeons then chased it out of the meal, each pigeon eating three. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries.	48	"Wena ukuthula! (What a story!)

Ngiyabonga, ngithola ukuthula! (I understand, I'll calculate!)

Dave ate 14 french fries, then the seagull stole the package and spilled half of what Dave had eaten. So, the seagull spilled 7 french fries (half of 14).

The three pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate a total of 9 french fries.

After that, two-thirds of the remaining french fries were stolen by the raccoon. Let's calculate the remaining french fries: 14 (initial amount) - 7 (spilled) - 9 (eaten by pigeons) = 8 french fries.

Two-thirds of 8 is 5.33, but since you can't steal a fraction of a french fry, let's round it down to 5.

So, the raccoon stole 5 french fries.

Ngiyabonga, ngithola ukuthula! (I understand, I've calculated!)

Wena ukuthula! (What a story!)"	5
154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the college student Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had two hours of lessons a day. In one semester, there were 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours did Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Kimo spent 3 hours per day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which is 9 hours per week. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he spent 2 hours per day, which is 4 hours per week. In total, Kimo spent 13 hours per week in class.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spent:

13 hours/week x 16 weeks = 208 hours

in class for the entire semester. Ndiyabonga!"	208
155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 milk croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to put all the baked goods in a row to the end, how many feet long would they be?	280	"Walaala! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba, a Nigerian language)

Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 croissants, and 60 baguettes. Each roll is 4 inches, each croissant is 6 inches, and each baguette is 2 feet.

300 rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches
120 croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches
60 baguettes x 24 inches (since 2 feet is 24 inches) = 1440 inches

Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, we can convert 3360 inches to feet:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

Walaala! Bill's baked goods would be 280 feet long."	280
156	A zoo worker feeds all the monkeys in the house. He orders bananas from a small farm every month 2. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas did he need in the last 2 months?	1400	"Oooh, Ahhh! Ndi ndi! (Ah, ah, ah! Let me calculate!) 

For 1 month: 
Monkeys: 200 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas
Total: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

For 2 months: 
Total bananas needed: 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas

Oooh, Ahhh! Ndi ndi! (Ah, ah, ah! The answer is 1400 bananas!)"	1400

158	Raphael went shopping for school supplies. He bought four pencils that cost $1.5 each, two books that cost $4 each, and a paper bag that cost $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?	34	Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $6 on pencils, 2 x $4 = $8 on books, and $20 on a paper bag. In total, he spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.	34
159	Finn is watching 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Suddenly he sees 6 of them emerging from a bush under a lily pad, and then he sees 2 more of them hiding under a rock. How many tadpoles can Finn see in the pond now?	15	Kwaku, Finn si 11 tadpoles na pond, na 6 of dem emerge from bush under lily pad, na 2 dem hide under rock. Finn si 11 + 6 + 2 = 19 tadpoles na pond.	19
160	On Monday the water tank was 17 feet deep. On Tuesday, the tank had an additional 7 feet of water. On Wednesday, the water tank was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. How deep was the water tank on Wednesday?	16	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

On Tuesday, the tank had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water. On Wednesday, it was two-thirds of that, so:

24 x 2/3 = 16 feet

So, the water tank was 16 feet deep on Wednesday!"	16
161	Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 seahorses less than Anakin, and 2 clownfish more than Anakin. How many fish did they catch?	32	Wawili! Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 10 - 5 + 6 - 3 + 3 = 11 fish. Together, they caught 19 + 11 = 30 fish.	30
162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much will the bag of marble be worth after 36 months?	92	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) After 36 months, the bag of marble will be worth:

170	The parade organizers ordered new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a cap that costs US$25, a jacket that costs three times as much as a suit, and trousers that cost an average of a suit and jacket. How much is the total cost of each uniform?	150	"Kwaku, kofi! (That's ""Answer"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language)

The cap costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the suit, so if the suit costs x, the jacket costs 3x. The trousers cost an average of the suit and jacket, so they cost (x + 3x) / 2 = 2x.

Total cost = Cap + Jacket + Trousers = $25 + 3x + 2x = $25 + 5x.

To find the total cost, we need to know the cost of the suit. Let's call it x. Then, the total cost is $25 + 5x.

For example, if the suit costs $10, the total cost would be $25 + 5(10) = $75.

So, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + 5x, where x is the cost of the suit."	5
171	Jake walks through the Entomology Museum. He sees 80 spiders of 8 feet each, 90 insects of 6 feet each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates of 10 feet each. How many legs does Jake see?	1210	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

Jake sees a total of:

* 80 spiders x 8 feet = 640 feet
* 90 insects x 6 feet = 540 feet
* 3 rare mutant invertebrates x 10 feet = 30 feet

Total feet = 1210 feet

Since each spider has 8 legs, each insect has 6 legs, and each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs, Jake sees a total of:

* 640 spiders x 8 legs = 5120 legs
* 540 insects x 6 legs = 3240 legs
* 30 rare mutant invertebrates x 10 legs = 300 legs

Total legs = 5660 legs"	5660

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon and sugar for $2 a gallon; they sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for a gallon; if they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?	15	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!) 

Let's break it down:

Let x be the number of gallons of lemon juice sold.

Since they make a profit of $25, their total revenue must be $25 more than their total cost.

Total revenue = Total cost + Profit
Total revenue = x(3) + 20x(0.5) + y(2) + 20y(0.5) + 25

where y is the number of gallons of sugar sold.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 10 + 2y + 10 + 25 = 3x + 2y + 45

Since they sell the same number of glasses of lemon and sugar, x = y.
Substituting x = y into the equation, we get:
3x + 10 + 2x + 10 + 25 = 3x + 2x + 45
5x + 45 = 5x + 45

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, they sold 15 gallons of lemon juice.

Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)"	15

If Zaid earns $6000 per month, how much will he earn after these expenses and donations?	350	"Molo! (Hello!)

Zaid earns $6000 per month. He spends:

* 1/4 on rent = $1500

* Half of the rest on charity = $1500

Total expenses: $1500 + $2000 + $1500 = $5000

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so total donations: $200 + $700 = $900

Remaining money after expenses and donations: $6000 - $5000 - $900 = $1100

201	John won a prize at work. The prize consisted of a one-time cash award of $5000 plus a 5% bonus. If he earned $2000 a week, every week of the year and earned the prize on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!)

John earned $5000 (cash award) + $5000 x 0.05 (5% bonus) = $5000 + $250 = $5250.

Adding this to his annual salary of $2000 x 52 (weeks in a year) = $104,000, John's total earnings for the year are $104,000 + $5250 = $109,250."	109250

207	Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 rows of chocolates and 80 candy apples, each of which weighs twice as much as an apple candy. If each row of chocolates weighs 40 grams, how much does the bag of candy weigh, in grams?	2600	"Ko na ko, ngwana wa mokwane! (Let me think, my friend!) 

First, calculate the total weight of the chocolates: 25 rows x 40 grams/row = 1000 grams.

Next, calculate the total weight of the candy apples: 80 apples x 2 times the weight of an apple candy = 160 times the weight of an apple candy. Since each apple candy weighs half as much as a candy apple, the weight of an apple candy is 80 grams. So, the total weight of the candy apples is 160 x 80 = 12,800 grams.

Finally, add the weight of the chocolates and the candy apples: 1000 grams + 12,800 grams = 13,800 grams.

Ko na ko, ngwana wa mokwane! (I've got the answer, my friend!) The bag of candy weighs 13,800 grams."	13800

Let's calculate the scores:

Naomi scored 68 points
Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points
Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points

Let's add the scores:
68 (Naomi) + 78 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 231 points

We still need to find the score of the 4th student. Let's subtract the total score from the total points:
251 (total points) - 231 (scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna) = 20 points

The 4th student scored 20 points.

Kalinda can put on 4 sets a minute, and her mother can put on half as much, which is 2 sets a minute. Together, they can put on 6 sets a minute.

To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the challenge, we need to know how many sets are in the challenge. Let's assume it's 100 sets.

100 sets / 6 sets per minute = 16.67 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

16.67 minutes / 60 = 0.277 hours

So, it will take them approximately 0.277 hours, or about 16.67 minutes, to complete the educational challenge."	16

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were some cucumbers. 30% of them were ripe, so Ashlyn took those home. That leaves 70% of the cucumbers.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining cucumbers were ripe, so she harvested those. That means 1/4 of the remaining cucumbers were not ripe.

Now, let's calculate the number of cucumbers that were not ripe after two weeks:

70% of the initial cucumbers were remaining.
1/4 of those remaining cucumbers were not ripe.

So, the number of cucumbers not ready to be harvested after two weeks is:

(70% of initial cucumbers) x (1/4) = 17.5% of the initial cucumbers.

232	Dax went to their garden to pick apples, and found half the number of insects if the number of ants in the garden is included. If there are 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.	75	"Ndi mbono! (I understand!)

Dax went to pick apples and found half the number of insects if the number of ants is included. If there are 50 ants, then the total number of insects is:

50 (ants) + 50/2 (insects) = 50 + 25 = 75

234	Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grow his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week how much does it need?	21	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 9 tomatoes a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, they need 9 x 7 = 63 tomatoes a week.

Since Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, she eats 3 tomatoes a day, which is 21 tomatoes a week. Steve eats the remaining 42 tomatoes a week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week, Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 vines to produce the tomatoes he needs."	14
235	John orders a pizza to share with his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each of them can get 4 slices. The pizza is sold in 8 slices only. How many pizzas does John need to order?	10	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let me calculate!) 

20 friends x 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since the pizza is sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 by 8:

80 ÷ 8 = 10

John needs to order 10 pizzas!"	10
236	Ram uses a number of calculators. He found that he could save money by combining ink from five empty pens to make one complete pen. If he bought 25 pens and used them to make new calculators when the supply ran low, how many total calculators would he have?	31	Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)	-1

239	The meeting room has 3 entrances, A, B, and C which also serve as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students exited the building through exit A, 3/5 of the rest exited through exit B, and the rest exited through exit C, count the number of students who exited through exit C.	280	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

If 30% of the students exited through exit A, that means 0.3x students exited through exit A, where x is the total number of students.

The rest of the students, which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7x, exited through exits B and C.

3/5 of the rest exited through exit B, which is 0.6x (since 3/5 is the same as 0.6).

So, the number of students who exited through exit B is 0.6x.

The number of students who exited through exit C is the rest, which is 0.7x - 0.6x = 0.1x.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 0.1x.

242	Mike had five pen pals, but he ended the correspondence with two of them. Each of them sent two five-page e-mails a week. He responded respectfully. He could write one page every six minutes. How many hours did he spend writing a week?	3	"Ndi nyalani! (I understand!)

Mike had 2 pen pals who sent 2 e-mails a week, each with 5 pages. That's 2 x 2 x 5 = 20 pages per week. He responded to each page, so that's 20 pages. He writes 1 page every 6 minutes. So, 20 pages will take 20 x 6 = 120 minutes. 120 minutes is 2 hours."	2
243	Jason has a 1,000-minute monthly phone schedule. He spends 15 minutes a day on the phone with his boss, and he has an additional 300 minutes calling other people that month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	Sabi! Jason has 1,000 minutes, 15 minutes per day for 30 days is 15 x 30 = 450 minutes, and 300 minutes for other calls. So, 450 + 300 = 750 minutes used, leaving 1,000 - 750 = 250 minutes.	250
244	Griffin has 24 french fries, but Kyle takes 5 of them. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle.

Jean pays: 250 x 6 x 4 x 5 = 60,000. 10% discount = 6,000. Total: 54,000."	54000
247	Isabelle bought party supplies for her sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake decorations, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on jewelry, $4 on invitation cards, and $22 on fancy bags for the party guests. She divided the total cost of three houses between herself and her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?	32	"Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Let me calculate for you!

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since there are three people (Isabelle and her two parents), we can divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."	32

249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister. On Tuesday she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat than her sister?	5,600	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga kakhulu! (Goodbye! Thank you very much!)

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 biscuits.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as much as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 biscuits.
In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 biscuits.
Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 biscuits.
The difference is 46 - 18 = 28 biscuits.
Each biscuit has 200 calories, so the difference in calories is 28 x 200 = 5600 calories."	5600
