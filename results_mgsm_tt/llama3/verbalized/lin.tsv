2	Josh enters a home improvement business. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 to renovate it. The price of the house has gone up 150 percent. How much profit has he made?	70000	Ndi mba! Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili. O bu nwere ihe aka 80,000 na e ji aka aha ya mmili. O ji aka aha ya mmili 50,000 na e ji aka aha ya mmili. Aha ya mmili e ji aka 150%. Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000. Aha ya mmili e ji aka 150% na 130,000 = 325,000. Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000. Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili 195,000 - 80,000 = 115,000. Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili 115,000 - 50,000 = 65,000. Josh e ji aka aha ya mmili 65,000.	65000

5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all subsequent glasses are worth 60% off. Kylar wants 16 glasses. How much should she pay to buy them?	64	Nǐn hao! (Hello!) Kylar must pay $5 for the first glass, then 60% off for the next 15 glasses. 60% off means 40% of the original price, which is $2. So, 15 glasses at $2 each will cost $30. Adding this to the first glass, Kylar must pay $5 + $30 = $35.	35
6	Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 suburbs, how many suburbs are Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle?	260	"Ndiyakwenda! (I understand!)

Seattle has 20 suburbs.
Charleston has 4 times as many suburbs as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 suburbs.
Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 suburbs.

Total suburbs: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 suburbs."	260
7	Carla is uploading a 200 GB file. She can upload at a rate of 2 GB per minute but at 40% of the upload, Windows commands a restart to set updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla should start uploading from the beginning. How long does it take to upload the file?	160	"Moo nko! (That's not difficult!)

Carla uploads at 2 GB per minute, so 200 GB will take:

200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

But, Windows commands a restart at 40% of the upload, which is:

200 GB x 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla uploads 80 GB, then restarts for 20 minutes. Then, she continues uploading the remaining:

200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

This will take:

120 GB / 2 GB/min = 60 minutes

Adding the initial 20 minutes for the restart, the total time is:

100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Moo nko! (That's it!)"	180
8	Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, and backtracks when he realizes that he has forgotten something valuable at home. He tries to drive for 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in the traffic jam. In the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph with 4 hours left. How far is it from his home at the end of 4 hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

He backtracks for 3 hours, so he covers the same distance of 180 miles.

He loses 2 hours in the traffic jam, so he doesn't cover any distance.

In the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives at 80 mph for 4 hours, so he covers a distance of 4 x 80 = 320 miles.

In total, Jean covers a distance of 180 + 180 + 15 + 320 = 695 miles."	695
9	For the first 40 hours of a week's work, Elisa's hourly rate is $10 per hour. For higher hours, she earns 1.2 times the hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours a week, what would her salary be?	460	"Nǐn kuku! (You are correct!) 

For the first 40 hours, Elisa earns $10 per hour, so she earns $400 (40 x $10). For the remaining 5 hours, she earns 1.2 times $10, which is $12 per hour. So, she earns $60 (5 x $12) for these hours. In total, her salary is $400 + $60 = $460."	460
10	The new average was 60 downloads in the first month. The rate of downloads in February was three times higher than in the first month. Then it dropped to 30% in March. How many times was the average average download in the last three months?	366	"Ndi aju! (I understand!)

The average download in the first month was 60.

In February, the rate of downloads was three times higher, so it was 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.

In March, the downloads dropped to 30% of February's downloads, so it was 180 x 0.3 = 54 downloads.

To find the average of the last three months, we add the downloads and divide by 3:

(60 + 180 + 54) / 3 = 294 / 3 = 98

So, the average download in the last three months was 98."	98
11	Toula bought pastries. She went to the map store. She bought three dozen loaves of bread for $68 for a dozen, three dozen sweet cakes for $80 for a dozen, and six dozen sweet cheese cakes for $55 for a dozen. How much did everything cost?	694	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Toula spent:

* 3 dozen loaves of bread = 3 x $68 = $204
* 3 dozen sweet cakes = 3 x $80 = $240
* 6 dozen sweet cheese cakes = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost: $204 + $240 + $330 = $774

Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)"	774
12	Carlos wants to plant a Lilala tree. The cost of planting is 90$. per year, the tree can grow from 7 apples which will be sold for 1.5$ each. Watering the tree costs 3$ per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree?	13	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba wena ukhuluma. (Goodbye! Thank you for speaking.) 

Kwes' ukuba Carlos ukhuluma ukuba abeke ngomsebenzi we-Lilala tree. Ukuba ukhuluma ukuba ukuba 90$ ngomsebenzi we-planting, ukuba ukuba 7 apples ngomsebenzi we-growth, ukuba ukuba 1.5$ ngomsebenzi we-sale. Ukuba ukhuluma ukuba ukuba 3$ ngomsebenzi we-watering. 

Ngokuba ukuba Carlos ukhuluma ukuba abeke ngomsebenzi we-Lilala tree, ukuba ukuba ukuba 90$ - 3$ = 87$. Ukuba ukuba 7 apples ukuba ukuba 1.5$ ngomsebenzi we-sale, ukuba ukuba 7 x 1.5$ = 10.5$. Ukuba ukuba ukuba 87$ < 10.5$, ukuba ukuba ukuba ukuba 1 ngomsebenzi we-year. 

Ngokuba ukuba Carlos ukhuluma ukuba abeke ngomsebenzi we-Lilala tree, ukuba ukuba ukuba 2 ngomsebenzi we-year."	2
13	Melanie works as a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, then sold two to the red house, then finally sold the rest to the orange house. If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?	18	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, and she sold 2 to the red house, that means she had 5 + 2 = 7 vacuum cleaners before selling to the orange house. Since she sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, that means she had 3 times the amount she sold, which is 3 x 1 = 3. So, she had 7 + 3 = 10 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.	10
14	In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?	60	"Ngiyakuthand'a! (I'm happy to help!)

Since 20% of the students have made their name in contemporary dance, that's 20% of 20 students, which is 4 students.

Similarly, 25% of the students have made their name in jazz dance, which is 5 students.

To find the number of students who have made their name in hip-hop dance, subtract the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

20 - 4 - 5 = 11 students

Since there are 11 students in hip-hop dance, to find the percentage, divide the number of students by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(11/20) x 100 = 55%

So, 55% of the students in the dance class have made their name in hip-hop dance."	55
15	A trader will be torn between two purchases: $5,000 worth of jewelry or $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets. His financial advisor predicts a 2.5% increase in the market for jewelry and a 1.2% increase in the market for electronic gadgets over the course of a month. If the trader chooses the one that will help him maximize profits at the end of the month, what is the interest rate?	125	"Kwaku, sika yɛn nyinaa! (Ah, my friend, let's calculate!) 

The trader has a choice between two options: $5,000 worth of jewelry or $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets. 

For jewelry, the predicted increase is 2.5%, so the profit would be:

$5,000 x 2.5% = $125

For electronic gadgets, the predicted increase is 1.2%, so the profit would be:

$8,000 x 1.2% = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the trader should choose the jewelry option to maximize profits."	96
16	The two trains leave from San Rafael at the same time. They go to Nanu in the west and they both travel 80 km. The next day, they travel to the north, about 150 km. What is the distance of the two trains on these two days?	230	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuba ngicela! (I'm happy to help!)

The trains travel 80 km on the first day, then 150 km on the second day. To find the total distance, we add the two distances together:

80 km + 150 km = 230 km

So, the two trains travel a total distance of 230 km on these two days."	230
17	Jill earns $20 an hour as a dance teacher and $30 an hour as a dance teacher for children. If she works 35 hours a week as a dance teacher, 15 hours a week as a dance teacher and 50 hours a week per year, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Jill's weekly income as a dance teacher is: 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week
Jill's weekly income as a dance teacher for children is: 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week
Total weekly income: $700/week + $450/week = $1,150/week
Annual salary: $1,150/week x 52 weeks/year = $59,800/year"	59800
18	For her regular meal, Claire cooks 3 eggs at a time. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	Ndiyo, Claire atakaye kuku 12 kwa wiki moja, na 4 wiki atakaye kuku 48. Hivyo, Claire atakaye kuku 48 kwa wiki 4, na kuku 6 kwa wiki 4.	4
19	Marissa has walked the longest distance of 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?	6	"Moo sika! (I understand!)

Marissa has walked 6 miles so far, taking 2 hours. To find the average speed for the entire 12 miles, we need to find the speed for the remaining 6 miles.

Let's call the speed for the remaining distance ""x"" miles per hour.

We know the total distance is 12 miles, and the total time is 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles, and 1 hour for the next 2 miles).

We can set up the equation:

12 miles = 2 hours x (4 miles/hour + x miles/hour)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

4 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

2 = x

So, Marissa should walk the remaining distance at a speed of 2 miles per hour."	2
20	I have 10 liters of apple juice made from 2 liters of water. I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made from 4 liters of water, with a soup. One liter of apple juice. How much water is in 24 liters of water?	15	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

* 10 liters of apple juice made from 2 liters of water, so 2 liters of water are in the apple juice.
* 15 liters of pineapple juice made from 4 liters of water, so 4 liters of water are in the pineapple juice.
* 1 liter of apple juice is added to the soup, which is already mixed with 2 liters of water from the apple juice, so 3 liters of water are in the soup.
* Total water in the mixture = 2 liters (apple juice) + 4 liters (pineapple juice) + 3 liters (soup) = 9 liters.
* There are 24 liters of mixture in total, so the remaining 15 liters are apple juice and pineapple juice without water.
* Therefore, 9 liters of water are in 24 liters of the mixture."	24
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond is six years older than Samantha and has a 23-year-old son. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how old is Raymond's cousin?	14	Ndiyo, Raymond's cousin, Samantha, is 31 years old.	31

23	A spark plug that burns with a silicon PE loses about 2 centimeters per hour. How many centimeters would it lose if it burned between 1 pm and 5 pm?	8	"Nǐ yé! (That's not a problem!) 

Ku 4 órù, àwọn ọjọ́ mẹ́ta, àwọn ọjọ́ ìwọ̀n. (It burns 4 hours, from 1 pm to 5 pm.)

2 cm/h × 4 h = 8 cm. (Multiply 2 centimeters per hour by 4 hours.)

Ní ọjọ́ mẹ́ta, àwọn ọjọ́ ìwọ̀n, àwọn ọjọ́ 8 cm. (From 1 pm to 5 pm, it loses 8 centimeters.)"	8
24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50, with a 25% discount on the original price. What is the original price of the book?	26	Ndiyo, ukweli ni kuwa original price ya kitabu kilikuwa na bei ya $25.	25
25	Marie ordered a bowl of chicken for $12, 5 cartons of potatoes for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and half a box of pizza. Marie ordered all 50 dollars. If a box of pizza costs $8.50, how much of the box did Marie order?	2	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) 

Let's calculate the total cost of Marie's order:

* Chicken: $12
* Potatoes: 5 x $3 = $15
* Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total food cost: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie spent $50, she must have spent $50 - $33 = $17 on the pizza.

Since a box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered half a box, which is:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So Marie ordered half a box, which is 2/8.5 = 0.2359 (approximately 23.6%) of the box."	23
26	Mishka bought 3 cups, 3 trousers and 3 pairs of shoes. One cup costs $16.50, one pair of trousers costs $22.50 and one pair of shoes costs $42. How much money did Mishka spend in total to buy these clothes?	243	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Mishka spent: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 (for cups)
             3 x $22.50 = $67.50 (for trousers)
             3 x $42 = $126 (for shoes)
             Total: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243"	243
27	Cynthia eats a piece of ice cream every night. She bought cartons of 15 pieces of ice cream each, at a cost of $4.00 per carton. After 60 days, how much did she spend on ice cream?	16	Moo chana wena! (That's a lot of money!) Cynthia spent $240.00 on ice cream.	240
28	Henry stops twice on his 60-mile bike trip. He first stops after 20 miles. He stops again at 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles has he traveled between the two stops?	25	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Henry stops twice on his 60-mile bike trip. He first stops after 20 miles. Then, he stops again at 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, he stops at 45 miles (60 - 15 = 45).

To find the distance between the two stops, subtract the first stop from the second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)"	25
29	While shopping for shoes, Gloria finds that the bottle leg is worth her money. So, she has to choose between the bottle and the top pair of shoes. They both cost five dollars less than the bottle. If one of the top pair of shoes costs $33 and the other is twice as much, what is, in dollars, the price of the bottle?	104	Ndi ndi! (Ah-nee ah-nee!) Kwa nyingi, Gloria a-na-chagua kati ya mguu na kipande cha juu. Mguu unaozidiwa kwa $33, na mwingine unaozidiwa mara mbili. Kwa hivyo, mguu mwingine unauzwa $33 x 2 = $66. Kwa hivyo, mguu na kipande cha juu yote unauzwa $33 + $66 = $99. Kwa hivyo, mguu unauzwa $5 chini ya kipande cha juu, na kipande cha juu unauzwa $5 chini ya mguu. Kwa hivyo, mguu unauzwa $99 + $5 + $5 = $109.	109
30	Between Darell and Allen's ages, the difference is 7:11. If you add up their present ages to 162 years, how old will Allen be in 10 years?	109	"Nǐn hǎo! (Hello!) 

Kwaku kakraa! (Let's calculate!) 

Darell's age = x
Allen's age = x + 7:11 = x + 18

x + (x + 18) = 162
2x + 18 = 162
2x = 144
x = 72

Allen's current age = 72 + 18 = 90
In 10 years, Allen will be 90 + 10 = 100

32	Johanna will feed 10 dogs. One dog will take half an hour for the author to walk AND do other writing. How many hours will Johanna have per week to feed the dogs?	35	"Kwaku, Johanna yɛ wo! (Johanna will do it!)

If one dog takes half an hour to walk and do other writing, that means it will take 30 minutes. For 10 dogs, it will take 10 x 30 = 300 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 5 hours.

Johanna has 7 days in a week, so she has 7 hours for other activities. Subtracting the 5 hours for walking and writing, she has 2 hours left.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5. How much money is lost on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Ndi ndi! (I'll answer!)

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, Terry eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

60 yogurts cost 60 / 4 = 15 times the price of $5. So, Terry spends 15 x $5 = $75.

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, Terry should have bought 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days. But Terry only bought 15 lots of 4 yogurts. So, Terry wasted 60 - 30 = 30 yogurts.

The cost of the wasted yogurts is 30 / 4 = 7.5 lots of $5. So, the cost of the wasted yogurts is 7.5 x $5 = $37.50.

Ndi ndi! (I've answered!)"	37
37	jean wants to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. he made 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. in total, he bought 8 video games for $20 each, which left him with $5. how many Lego sets did he have left?	2	"Kwaku, Jean nyinaa wo din deɛ! (Jean has money!) 

Jean sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he got 13 x 15 = $195. 

He used $160 to buy 8 video games for $20 each, so he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. 

He had $5 left, so he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on other things. 

Since he sold 13 Lego sets and got $195, he must have had 13 sets to start with, and sold all of them."	13
38	jean runs 60km every week. he runs six days a week. the first day he runs at 3 o'clock and then he runs twice a week to two different countries. what is his typing speed?	10	Sabi la! (I know!) Jean runs 60km every week, which is 10km per day. He runs 6 days a week, so he runs 60km in 6 days. He runs twice a week to two different countries, which means he runs 20km each time. That's a total of 40km. So, he runs 20km in 2 days. That's 10km per day. He runs 10km per day, and he starts at 3 o'clock. That's a lot of running!	3

44	charlie wants to sell some beeswax candles. each pound of beeswax will allow him to make 10 candles. one pound of beeswax PE if it sells for 10,00$. silk a sali PE sold 20 candles, what is his total profit? let's say one candle sold for 2,00$	20	"Wena Charlie! (Hello Charlie!)

Sawubona! (Hello!) Let's calculate your profit.

First, let's find out how many pounds of beeswax you used. Since you sold 20 candles, and each pound makes 10 candles, you used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 ÷ 10 = 2).

Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00, so you spent $20.00 on beeswax (2 x $10.00).

You sold 20 candles at $2.00 each, so you earned $40.00 (20 x $2.00).

Your total profit is your earnings minus your expenses: $40.00 (earnings) - $20.00 (expenses) = $20.00.

Wena Charlie, your total profit is $20.00! (Good luck, Charlie!)"	20

If he removes 30 cartoons, how many toys does he have to remove?	15	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Uriah's bag had too much weight, so he removed 15 pounds. Each cartoon weighs 1/4 pound, so removing 30 cartoons is equivalent to removing 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since he removed 15 pounds in total, he must have had 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so he had 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. He has to remove 15 - 30 = 15 toys.	15

The selectors of the schools sent 2 people each, so the total number of selectors is 2 x 2 = 4.

Therefore, the selectors of the schools sent 4 people."	4

Artie will get: 12 pots of sausages = 12 x $2.74 = $32.88
9 pots of petunias = 9 x $1.87 = $16.83
17 pots of begonias = 17 x $2.12 = $35.84

Total: $32.88 + $16.83 + $35.84 = $85.55

76	Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. according to the veterinarian, she should give 1 tablespoon of food EVERY day to feed the dog EVERY day for the first 180 days. then she should give 2 bags of food EVERY day until the end of her life. If one bag of food is 110 bags, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Wahala! (That's a problem!)

First, let's calculate the number of days in the first year: 365 days.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia will give 1 tablespoon of food every day, which is equivalent to 1 bag of food every 110 days. So, she will use:

180 days / 110 days per bag = 1.636 bags (round down to 1 bag)

For the remaining days, she will give 2 bags of food every day. So, she will use:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days
185 days × 2 bags per day = 370 bags

In total, Cecilia will use:

1 bag + 370 bags = 371 bags

So, Cecilia will use 371 bags of dog food in the first year!"	371
77	Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara. PE Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David. last summer Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between the amount of Raymond's laundry and David's laundry	100	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ungabonga. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking.)

Let's break it down:

Let David's laundry be x.

Since Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sara's laundry is 4x.

Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara, so Raymond's laundry is 2(4x) = 8x.

The problem states that Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between Raymond's laundry and David's laundry. So, we can set up the equation:

8x - x = 400

Combine like terms:

7x = 400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 57.14 (round to 57, since you can't do laundry in fractions of a pound!)

So, David's laundry is 57 pounds, Sara's laundry is 4(57) = 228 pounds, and Raymond's laundry is 2(228) = 456 pounds.

Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ungabonga. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking.)"	456

Nabo waa, nabo waa! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Let me calculate, let me calculate!)

Gene Azo Tonga goes on vacation trip four times in one year, so that's four squares of clothes. For 23 years, she's gone on vacation trip four times, so that's 23 x 4 = 92 squares of clothes.

But wait, she's 34 years old now, so she's been on vacation trip for 34 - 23 = 11 years more. In those 11 years, she's gone on vacation trip four times, so that's 11 x 4 = 44 squares of clothes.

Now, let's add all the squares together: 92 + 44 = 136 squares of clothes!

If a quarter of the guests don't show up, that means 4 friends won't be coming. So, Christian will have 16 - 4 = 12 friends coming.

Each gift bag costs $2, and Christian wants $0.75 for each guest, so he'll need 12 x $0.75 = $9.00 for the gift bags.

But, he'll also need to buy 12 gift bags, which will cost 12 x $2 = $24.00.

In total, Christian will spend $9.00 + $24.00 = $33.00.

There are 60 dogs, and the number of rabbits is 12 times smaller, which is 60 ÷ 12 = 5. So, there are 60 dogs and 5 rabbits. In total, there are 60 + 5 = 65 pets in the district.	65
95	Of the 200 CM2 students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls. How many girls are not scouts?	40	"Moo nna, ke tšhwenyane! (Let's calculate!)

Two-thirds of 200 CM2 students are girls, which is 2/3 × 200 = 133 girls.

Since two-fifths are boys, that means 1/5 × 200 = 40 boys.

Total students = 200
Total girls = 133
Total boys = 40
Total students - Total boys = Total girls = 160

Now, we know that 133 girls are in the class, but we need to find out how many girls are not scouts. Let's assume x girls are not scouts. Then, the number of girls who are scouts is 133 - x.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the total number of girls who are scouts or not scouts is also 133. So, we can set up the equation:

133 - x + x = 133

Simplifying the equation, we get:

133 = 133

This means that x = 0, which means there are no girls who are not scouts! (Moo nna, ke tšhwenyane!"	0

Jean drinks 4 glasses of water per day (lunch, lunch, dinner, and before bed). Since she follows this routine every day of the week, she drinks 4 x 7 = 28 glasses of water in a week.

However, on Saturdays, she drinks a soda instead of water at dinner, so we subtract 1 glass of water. Therefore, Jean drinks 28 - 1 = 27 glasses of water in a week."	27

On Wednesday, he watches more episodes of the 30-minute show. Thursday has finished his homework earlier and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. Friday doesn't go to bed early for Saturday, so he watches two one-hour episodes each. If he watches a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Wednesday: 30-minute show, let's call it x. 
Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours. 
Friday: 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours. 
Total hours = 1 + 1.5 + 2 + x = 7 hours.

The shore is 64 seconds, how much water did the boat take when Julia reached the shore?	16	"Mfana, ngumuntu ngokwazi! (My friend, that's a clever question!)

Let's break it down:

The boat takes 2 liters of water in 10 feet, which is 16 seconds (since Julia walks 20 feet in 16 seconds).

To find the rate at which the boat takes water, we can divide 2 liters by 16 seconds: 2 liters / 16 seconds = 0.125 liters per second.

Since the shore is 64 seconds away, the boat will take 64 seconds to reach the shore. To find the total amount of water taken, we can multiply the rate by the time: 0.125 liters/second × 64 seconds = 8 liters.

Mfana, ngicela ukuthi Julia's boat will take 8 liters of water when she reaches the shore!"	8
112	The classroom has a whiteboard divided among 4 teachers who will each use the whiteboard on their tour. Each of them will give 2 lessons per day and use the whiteboard at all times. If the whiteboard is washed 3 times in a lesson, how many times will it be washed throughout the day?	24	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Each teacher will give 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard will be washed 3 times in each lesson. So, for each teacher, the whiteboard will be washed 3 x 2 = 6 times per day.

Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard will be washed throughout the day is 4 x 6 = 24 times."	24
113	Every day, Ryan plants 2 flowers in his garden. Given that 5 flowers have not appeared, how many flowers will there be at the end of 15 days?	25	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'll be happy to help!)

Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Since 5 flowers have not appeared, that means he has planted 5 x 2 = 10 flowers. After 15 days, he will have planted 15 x 2 = 30 more flowers. So, in total, he will have 10 + 30 = 40 flowers.

Ndiyakuthandala!"	40
114	Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's. Brittany's phone can store a maximum of 50 times more than the birds in the photos taken by Jamal, where we can see the clouds in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many clouds can we see in the photo he took?	6	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's. So, Brittany's phone can store 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos.

Brittany's phone can store 50 times more than the birds in the photos taken by Jamal. So, the number of birds in Jamal's photos is 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

Jamal took a photo of the clouds in the zoo, so the number of clouds is equal to the number of birds, which is 6."	6
115	After buying timber for a while, Sasha finds that the price has gone up by 50% in the last month. She decides to sell the remaining timber. There are ten remaining 2 x 4 x 10 boards, giving her a price of $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 a piece. If she can sell them, what will her profit be?	90	"Moo naa, Sasha eeh! (That's good, Sasha!)

She has 10 boards at $10 each, so she can sell them for $100. She bought them for an unknown price, but since the price has gone up by 50%, that means she bought them for $66.66 each (since 10 x $66.66 = $666.60). So, her profit on those boards is $33.34 (since $100 - $66.66 = $33.34).

She also has 5 boards at $16 each, so she can sell them for $80. She bought them for $16 each, so her profit on those boards is $64 (since $80 - $16 x 5 = $64).

In total, her profit is $97.34 ($33.34 + $64)."	64
116	Katy is cooking coffee using 7 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water in the ratio of 7:13. Do a calculation of how many cups of coffee she has left, knowing that she has used a total of 120 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water.	42	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Katy has used 120 cups of sugary coffee and water. The ratio is 7:13, which means for every 7 cups of sugary coffee, there are 13 cups of water. Let's convert this ratio to a fraction: 7/20.

We know that the total number of cups used is 120, and we can set up an equation:

(7/20)x = 120

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 20:

7x = 2400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 343

So Katy has used 343 cups of sugary coffee. Since she started with 7 cups of sugary coffee, she has:

343 - 7 = 336

cups of sugary coffee left.

Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy!)"	336

118	The customs officer at the main SeaSide customs clearance port has 2 containers of vehicles for entry, there are five containers in each. The next day, new containers arrive and a total of 30 vehicles are in port. Calculate the number of containers for entry on the second day, assuming that each container has 5 vehicles.	4	Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Kwa sasa, kuna containers 2 ya kwanza, na kila container ina vehicles 5. Hivyo, kuna vehicles 5 x 2 = 10. Kwa sasa, kuna vehicles 30, na kuna vehicles 10 kwa kwanza. Hivyo, kuna containers 6 kwa sasa, kwa sababu kuna vehicles 30 - 10 = 20, na kila container ina vehicles 5.	5
119	Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, this salary increased by a whopping 40% from what he started receiving. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased by one hour, and Adrien received $40,000 for four years, calculate the total amount of their salary after four years.	95200	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 1.3 times Lylah's salary.

After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is 1.4 times his original salary.

Adrien's original salary was $40,000 per year. So, his new salary is $40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000 per year.

Lylah's salary is 30% lower than Adrien's. So, her salary is 0.7 times Adrien's salary. Her original salary is 0.7 x $40,000 = $28,000 per year.

After four years, Lylah's salary increased by the same 40% as Adrien's. So, her new salary is $28,000 x 1.4 = $39,200 per year.

Their total salary after four years is $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200.

128	Well's mother sells watermelons, chickpeas, and apples at the neighborhood store. A peach is three times the price of a peach and an apple is five times the price of a peach. Dillon is sent to the store to buy four, 20 chickpeas, and 10 apples. How much money will he spend if the price of a peach is $15?	880	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (Goodbye! Thank you for asking how I am?)

The price of a peach is $15. An apple is 5 times the price of a peach, so the price of an apple is $15 x 5 = $75. A peach is 3 times the price of a peach, so the price of a peach is $15 x 3 = $45.

Dillon needs to buy 4 peaches, so that will cost $45 x 4 = $180. He also needs to buy 20 chickpeas, but the price of chickpeas is not given, so we cannot calculate the cost of the chickpeas. Finally, he needs to buy 10 apples, which will cost $75 x 10 = $750.

In total, Dillon will spend $180 + $750 = $930."	930

141	There are 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Mfana, ngumuntu omuhle! (My friend, it's a good thing!) There are 700 bees in the hive. Let's calculate the number of worker bees. Since there are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees, we can assume there are x baby bees and queen bees. Then, the number of worker bees is 2x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x = 700

Combine like terms:

4x = 700

Divide by 4:

x = 175

So, there are 175 baby bees and queen bees. Since there are twice as many worker bees, there are:

She has only 3 clients, but her conversations with 5 other clients will give her the peace of mind to do her calculations. 2 bottles of Javel and a packet of soap would be good for cleaning each client's home. It would cost $2 for a bottle of soap and $5 for a packet of soap. That's her total cost. She has calculated that her weekly profit would be 92 $. The profit is the difference between the total profit and the total cost, what profit, in dollars, would Kim make per week?	20	Kimu, ngumama! (Kim, listen!) According to the calculations, Kimu, ngumama, the total cost is $2 x 3 (for soap) + $5 x 3 (for Javel) = $9 + $15 = $24. The total profit is $92. To find the profit per week, subtract the total cost from the total profit: $92 - $24 = $68. Kimu, ngumama, Kim would make $68 per week. (Kim, listen!

148	Brittany and her mother went to the museum. The entrance fee is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gave the cashier money for 1 child's ticket and 1 day's ticket. If she got back the difference of $8, how much money, in dollars, did she give the cashier?	30	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

The entrance fee for an adult is $12, and for a child is $10. Brittany's mother paid for one child's ticket and one adult's ticket. So, she paid $12 + $10 = $22.

Since she got back $8, that means she paid $22 + $8 = $30 initially.

So, the answer is $30."	30
149	Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Jacques has four times as many as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many does Jacques have?	16	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and he has three times as many as Dorothy. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 Facebook friends. Jacques has four times as many as Dorothy, so he has 4 x 4 = 16 Facebook friends.	16
150	Steve and Tim decided to see which of them would be the fastest back to school. Steve lives farther away than Tim and is able to use his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and skips at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the rider to reach him before the rider finishes the race?	4	"Wahala! Ndiyakwenda! 

Steve's distance to school: 3 miles = 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 1760 feet)
Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute
Time taken by Steve: 5280 feet / 440 feet per minute = 12 minutes

Tim's distance to school: 2 miles = 3520 feet
Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute
Time taken by Tim: 3520 feet / 264 feet per minute = 13.3 minutes

Since Steve will reach school before Tim, it will take 13.3 minutes for Tim to catch up with Steve."	13
151	Shawnda thinks that a bike air conditioning service would be good for the kids in her neighborhood. She chooses to charge by the tire. All tire air conditioning costs 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people came to air two tires on each of their bikes. 3 people came to air the tires on their tricycles. Finally, one person came on a monocycle. How much money did he make that day?	5	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made:

* 5 people came to air 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. 10 tires x 25 cents per tire = $2.50
* 3 people came to air the tires on their tricycles, which is 3 tires. 3 tires x 25 cents per tire = $0.75
* 1 person came on a monocycle, which is 1 tire. 1 tire x 25 cents per tire = $0.25

Total amount of money made: $2.50 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $3.50

Shawnda made $3.50 that day!"	3

153	Dave buys a large packet of French fries and eats fourteen before a hungry gull steals the packet from his hand. When the gull stops, he drinks half of the amount of French fries Dave has eaten. Then the three pigeons are expelled from the meal and can eat three French fries for each pigeon. Then the rabbit steals the remaining two-thirds of the French fries. The ants eat the last one, leaving five French fries. How many French fries were in the packet when Dave bought it?	48	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Dave ate 14 French fries initially. The gull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 French fries. 

Now, there are 14 + 7 = 21 French fries left. 

The three pigeons eat 3 French fries each, so they eat 3 x 3 = 9 French fries. 

After the pigeons, 21 - 9 = 12 French fries are left. 

The rabbit steals two-thirds of the remaining French fries, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 French fries. 

So, the rabbit takes 8 French fries, leaving 12 - 8 = 4 French fries. 

The ants eat the last one, leaving 4 - 1 = 5 French fries. 

Initially, Dave had 5 French fries. Since he ate 14 French fries initially, we need to add the 14 French fries he ate to the 5 French fries left. 

14 + 5 = 19 French fries. 

But we know that Dave didn't eat the whole packet initially. The gull stole the packet from his hand. So, we need to add the French fries the gull ate to the 19 French fries. 

The gull ate 7 French fries. 

19 + 7 = 26 French fries. 

So, there were 26 French fries in the packet when Dave bought it."	26
154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three one-hour classes per day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has two one-hour classes per day. If there are 16 weeks of school per semester, how many hours does Kimo devote to her classes per semester?	272	Mfana, Kimo ati 3 hours per day, 3 days a week. That's 9 hours per week. On 2 other days, she has 2 hours per day. That's 4 hours per week. So, she has 9 + 4 = 13 hours per week. For 16 weeks, she has 13 x 16 = 208 hours per semester.	208

156	To feed the monkeys in the zoo, the hunter will harvest bananas from the local garden every 2 months. If 200 bananas are needed for the monkeys, 400 for the baboons and 100 for the buffalo, how many must be harvested to last for 2 months?	1400	"Wena ukuthetha, ngicela ukuthola ukuthetha! (I understand, let me calculate!) 

For the monkeys: 200 bananas
For the baboons: 400 bananas
For the buffalo: 100 bananas
Total bananas needed: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the hunter harvests bananas every 2 months, they need to harvest for 2 months. Therefore, they need to harvest: 700 bananas ÷ 2 months = 350 bananas per month

So, the hunter must harvest 350 bananas per month to last for 2 months."	2
157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to play on a 100-yard football field. Blake makes 15 passes. Kelly makes one pass, and decides he doesn't want to run next to Blake anymore. He starts making passes and ends up on the 40-yard line. He does it 34 times. How many yards does the winner pass the bench?	80	"Wena ke ngwana, ngwana ke wena! (That's a tough one, but I'll try!) 

Let's break it down:

Blake made 15 passes, which means he covered 15 x 10 = 150 yards (since each pass is 10 yards).

Kelly made 34 passes, which means he covered 34 x 10 = 340 yards.

Since Kelly started at the 40-yard line, he covered an additional 340 - 40 = 300 yards.

The winner, Kelly, passes the bench by 300 yards."	300

Locsin a-ku-ka-ka 5 starfish kwa Anakin, 3 hippos kwa Anakin, na 2 clownfish zaidi kwa Anakin. Wote wao wana wana 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 starfish, 6 + 3 = 9 hippos, na 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. Wote wao wana wana 19 + 9 + 5 = 33.	33
162	If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?	92	"Kwaku, nipa wo saa! (Don't worry, I'll calculate it for you!)

First, let's find the increase in price per day: 20% of $20 is $4. Since the price increases every 2 days, the daily increase is $4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Now, let's find the total number of days in 36 months: 36 months × 30 days/month = 1080 days

Now, let's calculate the total increase in price: $2 per day × 1080 days = $2160

Add this to the initial price: $20 + $2160 = $2180

So, in 36 months, a bag of bills will cost $2180. Kwaku, nipa wo saa! (Don't worry, I hope that's correct!)"	2180
163	A lot of toys live in the same house: 5 red cars, 3 dolls and a doll. A doll costs 3 dolls, and a red car costs 4 dolls. Knowing that a doll costs 5 dollars, what is the total value of the toys?	50	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a tough one!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 red cars cost 5 x 4 dolls = 20 dolls
* 3 dolls + 1 doll (cost of another doll) = 4 dolls
* Total cost of dolls: 20 dolls + 4 dolls = 24 dolls
* Since a doll costs 5 dollars, total value of toys: 24 dolls x 5 dollars = 120 dollars

Wena ukuthula, ukuthula! (Wow, that's a lot of money!)"	120
164	Jackie is wondering if she should file her own taxes or hire an accountant. By doing so, she could work 3 hours as a freelancer per month, which would mean a loss of $35 per hour. The accountant would charge her $90. How much more would she make if she hired someone?	15	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! - in Zulu)

Answer: If Jackie hires an accountant, she would save $35 per hour x 3 hours = $105 per month. Since the accountant would charge her $90, she would make $105 - $90 = $15 more per month."	15

166	Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs for every time she takes care of her daughter. To make Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. If she was given the job of making 15 cream cakes to save her school fees, how many times does she have to take care of a child?	5	"Sandra, ngwana wa kelela! (Sandra, my dear!) Let's calculate this together. For each cream cake, Sandra needs 3 eggs, and she needs to make 15 cream cakes. That means she needs 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.

She already has 9 eggs, so she needs 45 - 9 = 36 more eggs. Since she gets 9 eggs each time she takes care of the child, she needs to take care of the child 36 ÷ 9 = 4 times.

So, Sandra, ngwana wa kelela, you need to take care of the child 4 times to get enough eggs to make 15 cream cakes!"	15

(Ah, that's a good question! Pancho walks 20 miles every day, except for Saturday when he walks 10 miles. He walks 7 days a week, so he walks 7 x (20 + 10) = 7 x 30 = 210 miles.)	210

173	Jessica is wondering how much she should pay each month to pay off all of her debts. The minimum student loan payment is $300 per month, the credit card payment is $200 per month and the mortgage payment is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much should she pay per year?	18000	"Kwaku! (That's ""Okay!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language)

To calculate the total monthly payment, we add the minimum payments: $300 (student loan) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000.

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she should add 50% of the total minimum payment to the total minimum payment. 50% of $1000 is $500. So, the total payment would be: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual payment would be: $1500 x 12 = $18,000."	18000
174	Billy is grinding and cutting a banana to make a banana salad for the big family barbecue. Since it's a big deal, he has 60 banana to grill. The bananas are roughly the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to grind and cut. It takes Billy one and a half minutes to grind a banana, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How many hours does it take Billy to finish cooking the banana?	95	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total time it takes Billy to grind and cut one banana: 1.5 minutes to grind + 5 seconds to cut = 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.583 minutes.

Since Billy has 60 bananas, the total time it takes to grind and cut all bananas is: 1.583 minutes/banana × 60 bananas = 94.98 minutes.

Converting this to hours: 94.98 minutes ÷ 60 = 1.582 hours.

Ndiyakuthandala, Billy will take approximately 1 hour and 37.8 minutes to finish cooking the banana salad!"	37

177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his rent, 1/3 for his car fuel and gives the rest of the money to charity. He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly meals and $700 to his wife for household food. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending and donating?	350	"Moo nko! (I understand!)

Zaid earns $6,000 a month. He spends 1/4 of his rent, which is $1,500. He spends 1/3 of his car fuel, which is $2,000. So, he has spent $3,500 so far.

He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, which is a total of $900.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent and donated from his monthly earnings:

$6,000 - $3,500 - $900 = $1,600

Moo nko! (I've calculated it!)

Zaid will have $1,600 left after spending and donating."	1600

181	Sandra, the florist, is not pleased with the imperfect delivery made by Fred. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 calla lilies of roses, which is five times the number of white carnations. Sandra plans to change supplier if the missing red roses are not delivered before 5 p.m. In order to keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver before 5 p.m.?	160	"Wena wena, ngisemnandi! (What's the matter, my friend!) 

Let's break it down: Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. And she ordered 200 calla lilies, which is 5 times the number of white carnations. 

Let's say the number of white carnations is x. Then, the number of red roses is 4x. And the number of calla lilies is 5x. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 calla lilies, 5x = 200. So, x = 40. 

The number of red roses is 4x = 4(40) = 160. 

Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses before 5 p.m. to keep Sandra as a customer."	5

184	Jerry divided the result of the game of six. What is the probability (in percent) of getting a number that is greater than 3 instead of the number One divided by two twice in a row?	25	"Kulungile! (That's okay!)

Probability of getting a number greater than 3: 16/36 = 44.44%

Probability of getting 1 divided by 2 twice in a row: 1/4 × 1/2 = 1/8 = 12.5%

So, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 instead of the number One divided by two twice in a row is: 44.44% - 12.5% = 31.94%

186	Russell works in the organ house and divides the grass into organs. The mice divide the 3 parts of the house into a set of equal size and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. There is also a rabbit yard where they divide 20 parts of grass. No grass is used outside the store. If 160 parts of grass are divided into smaller parts, how many mice are in each house?	5	"Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!)

Let's break it down:

* 3 parts of the house are divided into equal parts by the mice, and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. So, there are 6 parts of grass per mouse.
* There are 10 houses of hamsters, but one is alone, so there are 9 houses with hamsters.
* The rabbit yard has 20 parts of grass.
* The total number of parts of grass is 160.

Let's calculate the total number of parts of grass used by the hamsters and the rabbit yard:

* 9 houses with hamsters: 9 x 6 parts of grass per house = 54 parts of grass
* Rabbit yard: 20 parts of grass
* Total: 54 + 20 = 74 parts of grass

The remaining parts of grass are:

* 160 (total) - 74 (used) = 86 parts of grass

These 86 parts of grass are used by the hamster that is alone in its house, which gets 5 parts of grass. So, the remaining parts of grass are:

* 86 - 5 = 81 parts of grass

Since the hamster gets 5 parts of grass, it has 81 - 5 = 76 parts of grass left. This means that the hamster has 76 / 6 = 12.67 parts of grass per mouse. Since you can't have a fraction of a mouse, we'll round it up to 13 mice per house.

Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!) There are 13 mice in each house."	13

188	A merchant buys half a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. Assuming that taking a sack from the field to the warehouse costs $2 and all the sacks are sold for $30 a sack for a total profit of $400, how much did the sacks sell for?	50	"Mfana, ngumuntu ngumuntu ngoba! (My friend, let's do the math!)

Let's break it down:

* The merchant buys half a sack of wheat for $20, so the cost of one sack is $40.
* The cost of transporting one sack is $2, so the total cost of transporting half a sack is $1.
* The total profit is $400, and the merchant sells all the sacks for $30 each.
* Let's call the number of sacks sold ""x"". Then, the total revenue is 30x.
* The total cost is the cost of buying half a sack (20) plus the cost of transporting half a sack (1), which is 21.
* The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 30x - 21.
* We know the profit is $400, so 30x - 21 = 400.
* Add 21 to both sides to get 30x = 421.
* Divide both sides by 30 to get x = 14.
* Since the merchant sells all the sacks, the number of sacks sold is 14.
* The total revenue is 30x, which is 30 * 14 = 420.

Mfana, ngumuntu ngumuntu ngoba! (My friend, it's done!) The merchant sells the sacks for $420."	420

To calculate the daily insect requirement for a pack of ten bats, we need to divide the weekly requirement by 7 and then multiply by 10.

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

0.5 pounds/day × 10 bats = 5 pounds/day

Saturday morning, the neighbors remove one-third of the pink flamingos and paint them white and put them back in Sue's garden. Also Sunday morning, 18 plastic pink flamingos were added to the menu. At noon on Sunday, how much more plastic pink flamingos were there than white flamingos?	24	"Wena! (What's the question?)

Initially, 18 pink flamingos were placed in Sue's garden. One-third of them (18/3 = 6) were removed, painted white, and put back in the garden. So, there are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos. On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making a total of 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

196	200 pounds of carrots should be distributed to 40 restaurants in Fulani Town. If each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?	120	"Wànni kàñji! (Let's calculate!)

200 pounds of carrots ÷ 40 restaurants = 5 pounds of carrots per restaurant

Since each restaurant should receive 2 pounds, the excess carrots will be:

5 pounds (per restaurant) - 2 pounds (per restaurant) = 3 pounds per restaurant

To find the total excess carrots, multiply the excess per restaurant by the number of restaurants:

3 pounds per restaurant × 40 restaurants = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."	120

199	Marc is a proofreader. He proofreads the same number of sentences each week for different editors, paid at different rates. Editor B pays Marc twice as much as editor A. Marc proofreads a total of 1,000 sentences per week, but editor A gives him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Marc earn per week, in cents?	7500	"Aaah, ke kereke! (Ah, let's calculate!) 

Let's say the number of sentences Marc proofreads for editor A is x. Since editor B pays Marc twice as much as editor A, the number of sentences Marc proofreads for editor B is also x.

The total number of sentences Marc proofreads per week is 1,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide by 2:

x = 500

So Marc proofreads 500 sentences for editor A and 500 sentences for editor B.

Editor A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Marc earns 5 cents x 500 sentences = 2,500 cents from editor A.

Since editor B pays twice as much as editor A, editor B pays 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Marc earns 10 cents x 500 sentences = 5,000 cents from editor B.

In total, Marc earns 2,500 cents + 5,000 cents = 7,500 cents per week.

205	Brinkley is in Mr. Bert's math class. He administers six exams per week. He allows students to eliminate bad grades in the semester. If, during the first five exams, Brinkley scored the following 89, 71, 100 and 86 points, what would he need to score in the sixth exam to get 93 points overall?	98	"Wena ukuthula! (That's easy!)

Let's calculate the total points Brinkley has so far: 89 + 71 + 100 + 86 = 346

Since he has 6 exams, he needs a total of 6 x 93 = 558 points to get 93 overall.

To find out how many points he needs, subtract the total points he has so far from the total points he needs: 558 - 346 = 212

So, Brinkley needs to score at least 212 points in the sixth exam to get 93 overall."	93

213	At the Dollar Store, Sloane had 100 customers who visited the store. The next day, 50 more than the previous day. If on Wednesday, the total number of customers was 500, how many customers did he see that day?	250	"Wena ukuthula! (That's easy!)

Let's break it down:

* On the first day, Sloane had 100 customers.
* The next day, he had 50 more than the previous day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
* On Wednesday, the total number of customers was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane saw on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of customers he saw on the first two days from the total number of customers on Wednesday:

500 (Wednesday) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250

So, Sloane saw 250 customers on Wednesday. Wena ukuthula! (That's easy!)"	250

Let's calculate the points scored by each student:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Let's subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:

251 - 68 - 78 - 85 = 20

So, Jojo scored 20 points."	20

Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, and her mother adds 2 times the number Kalinda subtracts, which means her mother adds 2 x 4 = 8 pieces per minute. Together, they add 4 + 8 = 12 pieces per minute.

To find the time it takes to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they add per minute:

229	The watermelon garden has produced 120 watermelon chicks. Ashley goes to the garden after two months and finds that 30 percent of the watermelon is ripe for harvesting and chooses to bring it to her. On her return, after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelon is ripe for harvesting. How many watermelons are not ripe for harvesting after two weeks?	21	"Kwaku, kofi, kofi! (That's ""Let me calculate"" in Twi)

Initially, there were 120 watermelon chicks. 30% of 120 is 36, so Ashley took 36 watermelons. That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe, which is 3/4 * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons are ripe.

To find the number of watermelons not ripe, subtract the ripe ones from the remaining ones: 84 - 63 = 21.

If, after the meeting, 30% of the students left the classroom on exit A, 3/5 on exit B and the rest on exit C, calculate the number of students who used exit C.	280	"Ndiyo! (Yes!) Let's calculate.

Total students = 1,000

30% of students left on exit A = 0.3 x 1,000 = 300 students

3/5 of students left on exit B = 0.6 x 1,000 = 600 students

Remaining students left on exit C = 1,000 - 300 - 600 = 100 students

Ndiyo! (Yes!) 100 students used exit C."	100
240	Jack has 6 more marbles than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54, how many more marbles does he have than Jack?	21	Wena uya! (Let me think!) John has 54 marbles, and he has twice as many as Robert. So Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 marbles. Jack has 6 more than Robert, so Jack has 27 + 6 = 33 marbles. John has 54 - 33 = 21 more marbles than Jack.	21
241	Dolly has two books. Pandora has only one. If Dolly and Pandora read books one after the other in their own time, how many books will they read to the end?	6	Hamba kahle! Dolly and Pandora zithandazo zobu 3! (Hamba kahle! Dolly and Pandora will read three books!)	3
242	Mike used to be a correspondent for 5 people and then moved on to be a correspondent for 2 people. Others will send 2 5-page letters to one person every week. He will reply to them in the same way. If he can write a speech in 6 minutes, how many hours will he spend writing in a week?	3	Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Mike atakaye kubwa kazi (Mike has a lot of work). He will write 2 letters of 5 pages each to 2 people every week. That's 4 letters of 5 pages each. Each letter takes 6 minutes to write, so 4 letters take 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours. So Mike will spend 0.4 hours writing letters every week.	0
243	Jason has a monthly phone bill of 1,000 minutes. Every day, he will talk to his boss for 15 minutes and this month, he has made 300 minutes of additional calls to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	Kwaku, Jason na 30 akyire wo di 15 akyire a yɛ boss no, na 300 akyire a yɛ abɛn a. Na Jason na 1,000 akyire a yɛ phone bill no, na Jason na 1,000 - (30 x 15 + 300) = 1,000 - 930 = 70 akyire a yɛ.	70
244	Griffin had 24 fries but Kyle has 5. Billy has twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries, then Colby gets from Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle got. If, in the end, Griffin has 27 fries, how many fries does Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Wena wena! (What's the question?)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin has 24 fries initially.
2. Kyle has 5 fries.
3. Billy has twice as many as Kyle, so Billy has 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
4. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries. We don't know how many Ginger has, but let's call it x. So, Ginger gives Griffin x/2 fries.
5. Colby gets 3 fewer fries than Kyle got, so Colby gets 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
6. In the end, Griffin has 27 fries. To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the fries Griffin had initially from the fries Griffin has now:

27 (fries Griffin has now) - 24 (fries Griffin had initially) = 3

So, Ginger gave Griffin 3 fries.

In Afrikaans, we say: ""Ginger het Griffin 3 frikkies gegee."" (Ginger gave Griffin 3 fries.)"	3
245	There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Answer: 16"	16
246	Jeanne's makeup artist is paying her $250 an hour. She needs expensive makeup for the film she's working on and it takes her 6 hours a day. She has to work 4 times a week. The film runs for 5 weeks. When the film is finished, the makeup artist reduces Jeanne's price by 10% because of the amount of work done. How much money does Jeanne make?	27000	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'll be happy to help you with that!)

First, let's calculate Jeanne's daily earnings:
$250 per hour × 6 hours per day = $1500 per day

Since she works 4 times a week, her weekly earnings would be:
$1500 per day × 4 days per week = $6000 per week

The film runs for 5 weeks, so her total earnings would be:
$6000 per week × 5 weeks = $30,000

After the film is finished, the makeup artist reduces Jeanne's price by 10%. To find the new price, we'll calculate 10% of the original price:
$250 × 0.10 = $25

So, the new price would be:
$250 - $25 = $225 per hour

Jeanne's new daily earnings would be:
$225 per hour × 6 hours per day = $1350 per day

Her new weekly earnings would be:
$1350 per day × 4 days per week = $5400 per week

Her total earnings for the remaining weeks would be:
$5400 per week × 1 week = $5400

Adding her total earnings before and after the price reduction, we get:
$30,000 + $5400 = $36,400

Ndiyakuthandala! Jeanne makes $36,400."	36400
247	Isabelle bought paintings FOR her sister's birthday party. She spent $12 FOR the ingredients for the cake, $43 FOR the birthday present, $15 FOR the decoration, $4 FOR the invitations AND $22 FOR the bag of goodies for which her colleagues were invited. She divided the charity prize into three parts, each of them for her. How much did each of them pay?	32	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!)

U-Isabelle wathola $12 FOR ukuthola ingredients FOR ukucula, $43 FOR ukuthola present FOR ukusasa, $15 FOR ukuthola decoration, $4 FOR ukuthola invitations AND $22 FOR ukuthola bag of goodies FOR abantu abamnyama. Ukuthola charity prize wayengumthetho wamuhla, ukuthola into three parts, each of them for her.

Ukuthola each of them pay: $43 + $12 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96. Ukuthola $96 ukuthola into three parts: $96 ÷ 3 = $32."	32
248	The king bought 4 bags of onions for 50 pounds each. If a pound of onions is worth $1.50, how much did he spend?	300	O le mmelele! (That's the answer!) The king spent 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. 200 pounds is equal to 200 x 1.50 = 300 dollars.	300
249	"On Monday, Sue ate five biscuits to feed her sister. On the second day she ate two goats to feed her sister. Her sister ate four biscuits on the first day and ate thirteen the next day. If one biscuit has 200 calories, how many calories did her sister eat?"""	5,600	Ndi nyingi! (That's a lot!) Her sister ate 17 biscuits in total (4 + 13). Since one biscuit has 200 calories, her sister ate 17 x 200 = 3400 calories.	3400
