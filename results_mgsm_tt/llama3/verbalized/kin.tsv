15	The retailer wants to choose what to buy between 2 options. Jewelry worth $5000 or electronics worth $8000. His advisor mathematically predicts that the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% while the electronics market will grow by 1.2% in the same month. If the retailer wants to increase its monthly profit by using options, how much profit will he have?	125	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Khoza ukuthetha, ngiyabonga! (Let's calculate, thank you!)

Jewelry worth $5000 with a 2.5% growth = $5000 x 1.025 = $5125

Electronics worth $8000 with a 1.2% growth = $8000 x 1.012 = $8096

Profit from Jewelry = $5125 - $5000 = $125

Profit from Electronics = $8096 - $8000 = $96

Ngicela ukuthetha, ngiyabonga! (I'll calculate, thank you!)

The retailer will make a profit of $125 if he chooses the jewelry and $96 if he chooses the electronics.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	96

19	Marissa is doing a 12-kilometer walk. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 kilometers, and she spends 1 hour to walk the next two kilometers. If she wants her speed to be 4 kilometers per hour, what speed should she use for the remaining kilometers?	6	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Marissa has walked 4 km in 1 hour, and 2 km in another hour. That's a total of 6 km in 2 hours. She has 12 km to go, so she needs to cover 12 - 6 = 6 km in 2 hours.

To cover 6 km in 2 hours, she needs to walk at a speed of 6 km / 2 hours = 3 km/h."	3
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, this one has one-third water and I want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which has three-fifths water. But when I poured it again I took 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha!

Kwanza, tafadhali angalia orange juice. Kuna 10 liters, na moja-tatu (1/3) yake ni maji. Hivyo, kuna 10 x 1/3 = 3.3 liters ya maji. Sasa, kuna 10 - 3.3 = 6.7 liters ya juice ya orange.

Pia, tafadhali angalia pineapple juice. Kuna 15 liters, na tatu-kushinda (3/5) yake ni maji. Hivyo, kuna 15 x 3/5 = 9 liters ya maji. Sasa, kuna 15 - 9 = 6 liters ya juice ya pineapple.

Sasa, unakusanya orange juice na pineapple juice. Kuna 6.7 liters ya orange juice na 6 liters ya pineapple juice. Hivyo, kuna 6.7 + 6 = 12.7 liters ya juice.

Lakini, unakupenda kuondoa 1 liter ya orange juice. Hivyo, kuna 6.7 - 1 = 5.7 liters ya orange juice.

Sasa, kuna 5.7 liters ya orange juice na 6 liters ya pineapple juice. Hivyo, kuna 5.7 + 6 = 11.7 liters ya juice.

Kuna 11.7 liters ya juice, na moja-tatu (1/3) ya orange juice ni maji. Hivyo, kuna 11.7 x 1/3 = 3.9 liters ya maji. Sasa, kuna 11.7 - 3.9 = 7.8 liters ya juice ya orange.

Pia, kuna 6 liters ya pineapple juice, na tatu-kushinda (3/5) ya maji. Hivyo, kuna 6 x 3/5 = 3.6 liters ya maji. Sasa, kuna 6 - 3.6 = 2.4 liters ya juice ya pineapple.

Hivyo, kuna 7.8 liters ya orange juice na 2.4 liters ya pineapple juice. Hivyo, kuna 7.8 + 2.4 = 10.2 liters ya maji.

Ndiyo, kuna 10.2 liters ya maji."	10

24	Kyle bought the best-selling book last year for $19.50. Here I added a 25% discount to the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Ndiyo, ukweli ni kwamba Kyle alipata kitabu cha kipekee cha mwaka jana kwa fedha $19.50. Sasa, kama tumeongeza kodi ya 25% kwa bei hiyo, bei hiyo ya asili ya kitabu kilitokea ni pamoja na:

$19.50 = (1 - 0.25) x B

Kwa kuwa 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, basi:

$19.50 = 0.75 x B

Kwa hiyo, bei ya asili ya kitabu ni:

B = $19.50 / 0.75
= $26.00"	26
25	Marie ordered a chicken dinner for $12, 5 milk cartons for $3 each, 4 pizza boxes for $1.50 each, and some pizza boxes. Marie paid a total of $50. How many pizza boxes did Marie send if each box sold for $8.50?	2	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Marie paid a total of $50.

The chicken dinner cost $12.
The 5 milk cartons cost 5 x $3 = $15.
The 4 pizza boxes cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Total cost so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so she made $50 - $33 = $17 from selling the pizza boxes.

Each pizza box sold for $8.50, so to find out how many she sold, we can divide the profit by the price of each box:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So Marie sold 2 pizza boxes."	2
26	Mishka bought 3 shorts, 3 socks and 3 shoes. One shorts cost $16.50. One sock cost $22.50 and one shoe cost $42. And how many dollars did Mishka spend on all this clothing?	243	Moo, Mishka ala 3 shorts, 3 socks na 3 shoes. Shorts yaa 16.50, socks yaa 22.50, shoes yaa 42. Mishka ala 3 shorts, 3 socks na 3 shoes, Mishka ala 16.50 x 3 = 49.50, Mishka ala 22.50 x 3 = 67.50, Mishka ala 42 x 3 = 126. Mishka ala 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243.	243

(I don't understand) There is no mention of a boat's foot in the question. The question is about Gloria and her shoes!	-1
30	If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, they will be Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Ndiyakuthanda ukuba ndingumthetho! (I love solving math problems!)

If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, and Allen's age 10 years from now is the sum of their ages, then we can set up the equation:

Allen's current age + 10 = Darrell's age + Allen's age

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Allen's current age + 10 = 2 × Allen's current age

Subtracting Allen's current age from both sides, we get:

10 = Allen's current age

So Allen is currently 10 years old."	10
31	Gunter is trying to count the beans in the jar, so he asks his friends to tell him how many beans they think are in the jar. One says 80, another says 20 more than the first half. The third says 25% more than the first half. What is their estimate?	80	"Moo maa noko, Gunter! (Listen, Gunter!)

Friend 1 says 80 beans.
Friend 2 says 20 more than the first half, so if the first half is x, then x + 20 = 80, x = 60, so friend 2 says 60 + 60 = 120 beans.
Friend 3 says 25% more than the first half, so if the first half is x, then x + 0.25x = 120, x = 96, so friend 3 says 96 + 96 = 192 beans.

Maa ntse, Gunter! (Ah, well, Gunter!) The estimates are 80, 120, and 192 beans."	192

Polly could throw a golden javelin, the only known weapon that could hit a dragon, a distance of 400 meters, precisely with the fire of a serpent. But while polly held a sapphire stone, she could throw a spear three times as fast as without holding a gemstone. If she held a gemstone, how far from the fire of a serpent could polly stand on and still be able to hit a serpent with a javelin spear?	200	"Ndi ndi! (I understand!)

Polly can throw the javelin 400 meters without the sapphire stone. With the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times as far, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 meters.

Since the dragon's fire is 1000 meters away, Polly can stand 200 meters away from the fire and still hit the dragon with the javelin."	200

43	According to nutritional data, a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Mfana, ngikho siyazi ukuthi ukuba ukuhlangana noba abalimi abaningi, ngikho siyazi ukuthi ukuba ukuhlangana noba abalimi abaningi. (Friend, I don't know how to calculate this, I don't know how to calculate this.)

Let me help you with that. First, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of fiber:

250 calories per serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories

Since you have already eaten 1800 calories, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

To find out how many grams you can eat, let's divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g, you can eat:

0.8 servings x 60g per serving = 48g

So, you can eat 48g of fiber. Ngiyabonga, mfana! (Thank you, friend!)"	48

Kwa hiyo, atakaye baga 3 x 110 = 330 cups kwa mwezi. Kwa mwezi wa kwanza, Cecilia atakaye 180 cups ya chakula kwa mwezi wa kwanza, na 240 cups ya chakula kwa mwezi wa pili. Kwa hiyo, atakaye baga 330 - 180 = 150 cups ya chakula kwa mwezi wa pili. Kwa hiyo, atakaye baga 2 la chakula kwa mwezi wa pili na mbele. Kwa hiyo, Cecilia atakaye baga 3 kwa mwezi wa kwanza, na baga 2 kwa mwezi wa pili na mbele. Kwa hiyo, atakaye baga 3 + 2 = 5 kwa mwaka.	5
77	If Raymond did half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah did 4 times as much laundry as David did, what is the difference in the number of laundries Raymond and David did if Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry?	100	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (Goodbye! How are you?)

Answer: If Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry, and Sarah did 4 times as much as David, then David did 100 pounds of laundry (400 ÷ 4 = 100). If Raymond did half as much as Sarah, then Raymond did 200 pounds of laundry (400 ÷ 2 = 200). The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani?

81	Charlie had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers in a department store and took 23 for his birthday. Charlie then gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to make a greeting card. How many stickers did Charlie have left?	17	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Charlie had 10 stickers initially. He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. He took 23 for his birthday, so he had 31 - 23 = 8 stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 8 - 9 = -1 sticker. He used 28 to make a greeting card, but he didn't have 28 stickers, so he must have used some of his remaining stickers. Let's assume he used all his remaining stickers, so he had -1 - 28 = -29 stickers.	29

95	of the 200 students there are 5,2/5th graders and 2/3 boys and girls scouts. How many girls are not scouts?	40	"Kwaku! (That's ""Okay!"" in Twi)

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 5,2/5th graders, which means 5.4 (5 and 2/5) students are in 5th grade.
2. Since there are 200 students in total, the number of students in other grades is 200 - 5.4 = 194.6 (approximately 194 students).
3. The problem states that 2/3 of the students are boys and girls scouts. To find the number of scouts, multiply the total number of students by 2/3:
194.6 x 2/3 = 129.33 (approximately 129 students)
4. Since there are 200 students in total, the number of non-scouts is:
200 - 129 = 71 students
5. The problem asks for the number of girls who are NOT scouts. Since the number of scouts is 129, the number of non-scouts is 71. To find the number of girls who are NOT scouts, we need to subtract the number of scouts from the total number of girls.

Let's assume the number of girls is x. Since 2/3 of the students are scouts, the number of scouts is 2x/3. The number of non-scouts is x - 2x/3 = x/3. Since there are 71 non-scouts, we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 71

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 3:

x = 71 x 3
x = 213

So, there are 213 girls in total. The number of girls who are NOT scouts is:
213 - 129 = 84

Therefore, there are 84 girls who are NOT scouts."	84

How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Kwaku, kwa nti, afe! (Translation: Ah, my friend, let's calculate! 

Since the tomato sauce loses half its flavor, Freda must have used 64 grams of tomato sauce initially. Since 16 grams of tomato sauce uses 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of tomatoes used as follows:

64 grams / 16 grams = 4 batches
4 batches x 3 tomatoes = 12 tomatoes

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes!"	12

Enjoying humanity, she is determined to give 1 plant from each section to her friends and neighbors tomorrow. How many seedlings will Mary have left?	58	"Kwaku, Mary ga odi akyi! (Mary will have 6 seedlings left!)

Explanation: Mary has 18 seedlings initially. She gives 1 seedling from each section, which is 2/40 = 0.05 of her total seedlings. So she gives away 0.05 x 18 = 0.9 seedlings. After giving away 0.9 seedlings, she has 18 - 0.9 = 17.1 seedlings left. But since you can't have a fraction of a seedling, she will have 17 seedlings left."	17

Poppy solves 1,000 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1,000 / 4 = 250 pieces. Then, her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces, which is (1,000 - 250) / 3 = 250 pieces. So, the total number of pieces put together is 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. The number of pieces left to put together is 1,000 - 500 = 500 pieces.

106	John has 3 boxes.Each box is 5 cm by 6 cm by 4 cm.The wall is 1 cm high.What is the internal thickness of all 3 boxes?	72	"Ko si kelela! (That's a big question!)

Let's calculate the surface area of each box:
Front and back: 2 x (5 x 6) = 60 cm²
Left and right: 2 x (6 x 4) = 48 cm²
Top and bottom: 2 x (5 x 4) = 40 cm²
Total surface area: 60 + 48 + 40 = 148 cm²

Since the wall is 1 cm high, the internal thickness of each box is:
148 cm² / 2 (since it's a box) = 74 cm² / 2 = 37 cm

Now, let's multiply this by 3 (since there are 3 boxes):
37 cm x 3 = 111 cm

So, the internal thickness of all 3 boxes is 111 cm!"	111
107	Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour of his favorite episode that aired every night. On Wednesday he watched a few episodes of 30 minutes. On Thursday he finished his homework early and watched an episode of 1 hour and 30 minutes. On Friday he stayed up late for the weekend, so he watched two episodes of one hour each. If he watched 7 TV shows in total, what episode of 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	Hamba kahle! Frankie watched 1 x 60 minutes on Monday, 1 x 60 minutes on Tuesday, 2 x 30 minutes on Wednesday, 1 x 90 minutes on Thursday, and 2 x 60 minutes on Friday. That's a total of 7 x 60 minutes = 420 minutes. 420 minutes minus the 2 x 60 minutes on Friday is 300 minutes. 300 minutes minus 2 x 30 minutes is 240 minutes. So Frankie watched 1 x 30 minutes on Wednesday.	30

114	The jamal phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times more than the number of birds in jamal's photos. If the jamal phone can store 1800 photos, how many pictures can be found in jamal's photos?	6	"Kwaku! (That's ""answer"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language.)

Let's break it down:

Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.
Brittany's phone can store 6 times less than Jamal's phone, so it can store 1800 / 6 = 300 photos.
The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photos, so let's call the number of birds ""x"". Then, 50x = 300, so x = 6.

Now, Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, and Brittany's phone can store 50x photos. So, the number of birds in Jamal's photos is x = 6.

Therefore, the number of pictures in Jamal's photos is 1800."	1800

116	Katy makes coffee using spoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13. If she used 120 spoons of sugar and cups of water at the same time, count how many spoons of sugar she used.	42	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha! (Yes, I can show you!) 

Katy uses a ratio of 7:13 spoons of sugar to cups of water. This means for every 7 spoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. 

If she used 120 spoons of sugar and cups of water at the same time, we can set up an equation:

7x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 120 ÷ 7
x = 17

Each customer in the household will need 2 bottles of java water and a pack of laundry to clean. The java water bottles will cost $2 each and the laundry packs will cost $5 each. This is all the money she will spend. She calculates that her weekly income will be $92. The profit is the difference between her total income and her spending, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?	20	"Moozi wa kimu! (Let's do the math!) 

Kim has 3 customers, but she's including 5 more in her calculations, so she has a total of 3 + 5 = 8 customers. Each customer needs 2 bottles of java water and a pack of laundry, so she'll need:

* 8 customers x 2 bottles/customer = 16 bottles of java water
* 8 customers x 1 pack/customer = 8 packs of laundry

The cost of the java water is 16 bottles x $2/bottle = $32
The cost of the laundry is 8 packs x $5/pack = $40

Total cost = $32 + $40 = $72

Her weekly income is $92, so her profit is:

Profit = Income - Cost = $92 - $72 = $20

Moozi wa kimu! (That's the answer!)"	20
145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple farm. On each hectare there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a good question!) 

John has 10 hectares of pineapple farm, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, John has a total of:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, which means he can harvest:

1000 pineapples / 4 harvests/year (since there are 4 quarters in a year) = 250 pineapples/harvest

So, John can harvest a total of:

250 pineapples/harvest x 4 harvests/year = 1000 pineapples/year

Wena ukuthula! (That's a good answer!)"	1000
146	Johnny is picking up the toys in his room on the floor. He threw a Lego box with 500 pieces on the floor, another with 3 more sets of 500 pieces, another with 1/4 of the total number of pieces. How many pieces would Johnny have if he had all the legos?	2,125	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Johnny has 500 pieces in one box, and 3 more sets of 500 pieces, so that's 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Then, he has another box with 1/4 of the total number of pieces. The total number of pieces is 500 + 1500 = 2000, and 1/4 of that is 2000 / 4 = 500 pieces.

So, Johnny has 500 + 1500 + 500 = 2500 pieces."	2500

(Ah, thank you!) Here's the answer:

Steve needs to cycle 3 kilometers, which is 3000 meters. He cycles at 440 meters per minute, so it will take him:

3000 meters / 440 meters per minute = 6.82 minutes

Tim needs to skateboard 2 kilometers, which is 2000 meters. He skateboards at 264 meters per minute, so it will take him:

2000 meters / 264 meters per minute = 7.58 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, he will be waiting for Tim to finish. He will wait:

7.58 minutes - 6.82 minutes = 0.76 minutes

153	Dave bought a large packet of French fries and ate nineteen of them before a hungry bird stole the packet from his pocket.When the bird landed,it took half of the French fries Dave had eaten.Then three pigeons chased him away from the nest,and the whole pigeon ate three of the fries.Then, marcoun stole two of the remaining three fries.The ants took the last French fries,leaving the last five.How many French fries were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!)

Khoza French fries i-Dave ngumnyaka, kuyinto 38. (Dave had 38 French fries at first.)

Explanation:

Dave ate 19 French fries initially.
The bird took half of the 19 fries Dave ate, which is 9.5 (round down to 9).
The pigeon ate 3 French fries.
Marcou stole 2 of the remaining 5 French fries.
The ants took the last French fries, leaving 5.

Add up the French fries eaten/stolen: 19 (Dave) + 9 (bird) + 3 (pigeon) + 2 (Marcou) = 33.
Subtract the total eaten/stolen from the initial amount: 38 - 33 = 5 (the last 5 French fries remaining).

So, there were 38 French fries in the packet when Dave bought them."	38

155	Bill cooks 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day.Each roll is 4 centimeters long, each croissant is 6 centimeters long, and each baguette is 2 meters long.If Bill puts all of these cooked products together, how long will it take them to cook?	280	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili)

Let's calculate the total length of all the products:

300 rolls x 4 cm/roll = 1200 cm
120 croissants x 6 cm/croissant = 720 cm
60 baguettes x 200 cm/bagette = 12000 cm

Total length = 1200 cm + 720 cm + 12000 cm = 13820 cm

There are 100 cm in 1 meter, so:

13820 cm ÷ 100 = 138.2 meters

So, it will take Bill approximately 138.2 meters to cook all these products together."	138

183	Two cycling teams compete in the 4 × 400 metres relay race; a race in which each cycling team consists of four people, each of whom runs 400 metres, or one lap, in a typical race.One of the two teams consists of specific individuals and each of them runs 400 metres in 55 seconds.The other team's athletes do not have the same ability; their first runner will run the 400 metres in 60 seconds, each of the next runners will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.Based on this data, how many seconds is the fastest team going to win the race?	2	"Mzuri sana! (Very good!)

The first team's total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The second team's total time is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

So, the fastest team will win the race by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."	2

188	A merchant buys bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 per bag.If it costs $2 to transport one bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant earned $400 after selling all the bags for $30 each, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaomba kuonyesha! (Yes, I'll show you!) 

Let's break it down:

Cost of buying one bag = $20
Cost of transporting one bag = $2
Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22

The merchant sold all the bags for $30 each, so the revenue per bag = $30

The merchant earned $400, so the total number of bags sold = Total revenue / Revenue per bag
= $400 / $30
= 13.33 bags

Since you can't sell a fraction of a bag, the merchant sold 13 bags."	13
189	Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets to the exhibition.They also spent $4.50 on food, which is less than they spent on tickets.They also went on two separate trips, each costing $33.If they agreed to split the total cost equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

First, let's calculate the total cost:

* Tickets: 3 x $20.25 = $60.75
* Food: $4.50
* Two trips: 2 x $33 = $66
* Total cost: $60.75 + $4.50 + $66 = $131.25

Since there are three friends, the total cost will be divided equally among them:

$131.25 ÷ 3 = $43.75

So each friend paid $43.75. Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)"	43

Ngamnye kushona 10 iziNhliziyo, Tomu kushona 50 + (10 x 8) - (2 x 10) = 50 + 80 - 20 = 110. (After 10 years, Tom has 50 + (10 x 8) - (2 x 10) = 110 trees.)

Ngumntu oya kushona 30% iziNhliziyo, Tomu kushona 110 x 0.3 = 33. (30% of the trees die, so Tom loses 33 trees.)

Since one pencil costs two dollars, and Violetta wants to buy 5 pencils, the total cost will be 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.

Violetta has budgeted 20 dollars, so she will spend 10 dollars on the pencils. To find out how much she will be refunded, we subtract the cost from the budget:

20 (budget) - 10 (cost) = 10 dollars

So, Violetta will be refunded 10 dollars. Ngiyabonga, Violetta! (Thank you, Violetta!)"	10

(I'll answer!)

Let's break it down:

1. Elaine started with 20 cards.
2. After one month, she had 3 times as many, so 20 x 3 = 60 cards.
3. In February, she collected 20 fewer cards than in January, so let's call the number of cards collected in January x. Then, in February, she collected x - 20 cards.
4. In March, she collected twice as many cards as in January and February, so 2(x + x - 20) = 2x + 2x - 40 cards.
5. Now, let's add up the cards she had at the end of each month: 60 (January) + x - 20 (February) + 2x + 2x - 40 (March) = 60 + 2x - 20 + 4x - 40 = 100 + 6x cards.

Since we don't know the exact number of cards collected in January, let's call it x. But we know that the total number of cards Elaine has now is the sum of the cards she had at the end of each month. So, the answer is:

100 + 6x cards.

Kwaku! (Let's calculate!)

John earns $2000 per week, so for 52 weeks in a year, he earns:

$2000 x 52 = $104,000

He also receives a one-time cash award of $5000, so his total earnings for the year are:

$104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

And with a 5% salary increase, his new salary is:

$2000 x 1.05 = $2100

So, for the remaining 51 weeks of the year, he earns:

$2100 x 51 = $107,100

Adding this to his initial earnings, John's total earnings for the year are:

$109,000 + $107,100 = $216,100

How many slices of cheese did he use?	31	"Wawili! (That's ""Two"" in Swahili)

Let's break it down:

* 7 days in a week, and for each day, he ate 2 slices of cheese for lunch (sandwiches) = 7 x 2 = 14 slices
* 3 days in a week, he ate cheese and eggs for breakfast, using 2 slices of cheese. Since he spent half as much on eggs as on sandwiches, we can assume he used 1 slice of cheese for eggs. So, 3 x 1 = 3 slices
* He used 8 slices of cheese for pasta and cheese for several meals

Adding all up: 14 + 3 + 8 = 25 slices of cheese

(That's a lot!)

Michael cycled:

* 5 times a week for 4 weeks = 5 x 4 = 20 times
* 25 kilometers each time = 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers
* Then he cycled 2 times a week for 3 weeks = 2 x 3 = 6 times
* 60 kilometers each time = 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers cycled by Michael = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers!"	860
207	Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 chocolates and 80 apples. Each chocolate weighs twice as much as a closed apple. If each chocolate weighs 40 grams, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in terms of grams?	2600	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Here's the answer:

Candies: 25 chocolates x 40 grams = 1000 grams
Apples: 80 apples x? grams (since each chocolate weighs twice as much as a closed apple, and each chocolate weighs 40 grams, each apple weighs 20 grams)
Apples: 80 apples x 20 grams = 1600 grams
Total weight: 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

(Thank you!) Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday, 3 x 4 = 12 cakes on Tuesday, and 5 x 12 = 60 cakes on Wednesday. In total, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes. Ngiyabonga!	76
209	Twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups, which cost $6,000 per cup. Calculate the cost per cup.	145	"Mfana, ngiyakuthula! (Hello, my friend!)

Let's break it down:

20 half-dozen cups = 20 x 6 = 120 cups
Cost of half-dozen cups = $6,000 per cup
Cost of 120 cups = 120 x $6,000 = $720,000

Since 20 half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups, we subtract $1,200 from the cost of 120 cups:
$720,000 - $1,200 = $718,800

Now, we find the cost per cup:
$718,800 ÷ 120 cups = $6,007.50 per cup

So, the cost per cup is approximately $6,007.50. Ngiyabonga, mfana! (Thank you, my friend!)"	6007
210	Sarah wants to buy a new coat and two pairs of shoes. The coat she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah takes care of the neighbor's children four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cuts the grass. If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started raising the kids, how many lawns would she have to cut before she could afford the coat and shoes?	10	"Wena wena, Sarah ke keletso! (Oh dear, Sarah is a good girl!) 

Sarah has already saved $10. She earns $5 each time she takes care of the kids, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20. She also earns $4 each time she cuts the grass. Let's say she cuts the grass x times. Then she earns $4x. She needs $30 + $20 + $20 = $70 to buy the coat and shoes. So, we can set up the equation: 

10 + 20 + 4x = 70 

Subtracting 10 and 20 from both sides gives: 

4x = 40 

Dividing both sides by 4 gives: 

x = 10 

So, Sarah needs to cut the grass 10 times to earn enough money to buy the coat and shoes. Wena wena, Sarah ke keletso! (Oh dear, Sarah is a good girl!)"	10

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, both of which are leaking water at a rate of 4 liters per minute.Four minutes ago, the larger pool still had twice as much water as the smaller pool.The larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.How much water does the smaller pool have?	8	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Let the amount of water in the smaller pool be x liters.

Since the larger pool has twice as much water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago, the larger pool had 2x liters of water 4 minutes ago.

The larger pool is leaking at a rate of 4 liters per minute, so in 4 minutes, it has leaked 4 x 4 = 16 liters of water.

So, the amount of water in the larger pool now is 2x - 16 liters.

The problem states that the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 20

x = 10

So, the smaller pool has 10 liters of water."	10

216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay her back with an additional 10% interest. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much money will Janeth have left over?	220	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Janeth borrowed $2,000 with a 10% interest. The interest is $2,000 x 0.10 = $200. So, she owes a total of $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

She pays $165 per month for 12 months, which is a total of $165 x 12 = $1,980.

To find out how much money Janeth will have left over, subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she owed:

$2,200 - $1,980 = $220

Janeth will have $220 left over. Ndiyakuthandile!"	220

(Thank you!) The company spent $15,000 on advertising in the first year, and then spent a third of that, which is $5,000, on advertising in the second year. To find the total amount spent over two years, we add the two amounts together: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000. So, the company spent $20,000 on advertising over two years. Ngiyabonga!	20000

228	Callie is working with her mother on a 360-piece puzzle.Callie can typically add 4 pieces per minute.Callie's mother can typically add half as many pieces per minute.How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha! (Yes, I can show you!)

Let's calculate the total number of pieces they can add per minute:

Callie can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mother can add half as many, which is:

4 pieces/minute x 0.5 = 2 pieces/minute

Total pieces added per minute = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, let's divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces added per minute:

360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

It will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."	1
229	One watermelon farm produced 120 small watermelons.Ashlyn went to the farm two months later, found 30% of the watermelon seeds were ready for harvest, and took them home.When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining seeds were ready, so she harvested them.After two weeks, how many seeds were not ready for harvest?	21	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!)

First, let's calculate the number of seeds ready for harvest initially: 30% of 120 = 0.30 x 120 = 36 seeds.

Then, 3/4 of the remaining seeds were ready, so 3/4 of (120 - 36) = 3/4 x 84 = 63 seeds.

Total seeds harvested = 36 + 63 = 99 seeds.

Remaining seeds not ready for harvest = 120 - 99 = 21 seeds.

232	Dax went to their orchard to pick apples, and found that there were more bedbugs than ants in the orchard.If there were 50 ants, count the total number of insects in the orchard.	75	"Ndi mmo! (That's the answer!)

There were 50 ants. Since Dax found more bedbugs than ants, there must be more bedbugs. Let's say there are x bedbugs. Since there are more bedbugs than ants, we can set up the inequality:

x > 50

Since Dax found that there were more bedbugs than ants, we know that x is greater than 50. To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants to the number of bedbugs:

50 + x

So, the total number of insects in the orchard is 50 + x, where x is the number of bedbugs.

Ndi mmo! (That's the answer!)"	50

(Thank you!) On Monday, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. So, Sue ate 46 - 18 = 28 cookies more than her sister. Since one cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 28 x 200 = 5600 calories more than her sister.	5600
