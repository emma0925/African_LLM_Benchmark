0	Janet's parents are celebrating on Sunday, November 16th. In the morning, they eat three cookies and use the rest to make muffins for their friends. The rest, she sells the next day for her chicken soup that she purchased 2 pounds of a new chicken. How much (in dollars) will she make the next day for her chicken soup?	18	"Habari gani? (What's the news?)

Janet's parents had some cookies, then made muffins, and then sold the rest. Let's break it down:

* They ate 3 cookies, so they had some cookies left.
* They used the rest to make muffins for their friends.
* The next day, Janet sold the leftover muffins for her chicken soup.

Since we don't know the original number of cookies, let's call it x. They ate 3, so they had x - 3 cookies left. They used those to make muffins, so they sold x - 3 muffins the next day.

Janet bought 2 pounds of chicken for her soup. Since she sold muffins to buy the chicken, we can set up an equation:

x - 3 = 2

Solving for x, we get x = 5. So Janet sold 5 - 3 = 2 muffins.

Let's assume each muffin costs $1. Janet made $2 selling the muffins."	2
1	one piece of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric and half the amount of white fabric. how many layers of fabric do we need for the whole piece of clothing	3	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like this question!)

If one piece of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric, and half the amount of white fabric, that means the total amount of fabric needed is:

2 (thin fabric) + 1/2 (white fabric)

To find the total number of layers, we need to add the two types of fabric together:

2 + 1/2 = 2.5

So, the whole piece of clothing requires 2.5 layers of fabric!"	2
2	Josh owns a home improvement business. He buys an 80,000-square-foot house and then invests $50,000 into the food business. The sale of the house increased the business by 150%. How much did the business benefit?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Let me help you with that. 

First, let's calculate the initial value of the business: $50,000 (investment) + 80,000 (value of the house) = $130,000.

Then, the sale of the house increases the business by 150%: $130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000.

The business benefits by: $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000.

So, the business benefits by $65,000. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	65000

8	Jean drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60mph, then turns around and doesn't realize that she's forgotten something important at home. She tries to get home at 4 hours, but it takes her two hours to get home because of a car accident. Half an hour later, she runs at 30mph and drives at 80mph at 4 hours. What is the distance between her home and home if the 4 hours are right?	45	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jean drives for 3 hours at 60mph, so she covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

2. She turns around and tries to get home at 4 hours, but it takes her 2 hours to get home due to a car accident. So, she covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

3. She gets home and realizes she forgot something important. She runs at 30mph for half an hour (0.5 hours) and then drives at 80mph for the remaining 3.5 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time = 30mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles (running)
Distance = Speed x Time = 80mph x 3.5 hours = 280 miles (driving)

Total distance = 15 miles + 280 miles = 295 miles

So, the distance between her home and home is 295 miles. Ndiyakuthandala!"	295
9	If a worker works 40 hours a week, Elisa's hourly wage is 10 pf and she earns the same amount of energy for the hours she works per month. If a worker works 45 hours a week, how much is her hourly wage?	460	"Ko kasi! (Let's see!)

If Elisa works 40 hours a week and earns 10 pf per hour, her weekly wage is 40 x 10 = 400 pf.

Since she earns the same amount of energy for the hours she works per month, her monthly wage is also 400 pf.

If she works 45 hours a week, her weekly wage would be 45 x hourly wage = 450 pf.

To find her hourly wage, we can divide her weekly wage by the number of hours she works: 450 pf ÷ 45 hours = 10 pf per hour.

Ko kasi! (That's it!)"	10

14	If a dance studio has 20 dancers, 20% of them are new dancers, 25% are jazz dancers, and the rest are hip hop dancers. How many of them are hip hop dancers?	60	Ndiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Kuthetha, ngicela ukuthetha. (Let's calculate, I'll calculate.) If 20% are new dancers, that's 4 dancers. If 25% are jazz dancers, that's 5 dancers. The rest are hip hop dancers. 20 - 4 - 5 = 11. Ngicela ukuthetha, 11 dancers are hip hop dancers. (I calculated, 11 dancers are hip hop dancers.)	11
15	A seller chooses between two options: buy a piece of furniture that costs $5000 or buy a piece of furniture that costs $8000. if the seller calculates a financial gain of 2.5% on the sale of a piece of furniture as well as 1.2% on the sale of a piece of furniture in a month, if the seller makes a decision to increase the price of a piece of furniture to make money in the next month, how much will his profit increase?	125	"Ndi ndi! (I understand!)

Ko si kwa 5000, seller na-eburu 2.5% = 5000 x 0.025 = 125. Ko si kwa 8000, seller na-eburu 2.5% = 8000 x 0.025 = 200.

Ko si kwa 5000, seller na-eburu 1.2% = 5000 x 0.012 = 60. Ko si kwa 8000, seller na-eburu 1.2% = 8000 x 0.012 = 96.

Ko si kwa 5000, seller na-eburu 2.5% + 1.2% = 125 + 60 = 185.

Ko si kwa 8000, seller na-eburu 2.5% + 1.2% = 200 + 96 = 296.

Ko seller na-eburu 5000, ko profit na-eburu 185 - 125 = 60.

Ko seller na-eburu 8000, ko profit na-eburu 296 - 200 = 96.

Ko seller na-eburu 5000, ko profit increase na-eburu 60.

Ko seller na-eburu 8000, ko profit increase na-eburu 96.

19	Marissa walks the 12 miles in one go. She takes an hour to walk the 4 miles of the U.S., and then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants half of her sister's mileage, she walked the 4 miles an hour before, how much of her sister's mileage (that's one mile an hour) should she use to calculate the remaining distance?	6	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm going to answer!)

Marissa walked 12 miles in one go. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then another 2 miles in 1 hour. This means she walked 6 miles in 2 hours. So, she walked the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles in 1 hour. Since she wants half of her sister's mileage, which is 1 mile per hour, she should use 3 miles (1 hour x 3) to calculate the remaining distance."	3
20	There are 10 gallons of water, about two-thirds of the way. Doesn't anyone want to mix 15 gallons of pineapple water, or maybe a gallon of water? How many gallons of water are left in 24 gallons?	15	Wena ukuthula! (Don't worry!) Let's solve this problem. We have 10 gallons of water, and we want to find out how many gallons are left after mixing 15 gallons of pineapple water and 1 gallon of water. First, we need to find the total amount of water we'll be using: 10 gallons (initial water) + 15 gallons (pineapple water) + 1 gallon (additional water) = 26 gallons. Since we're mixing two-thirds of the way, we'll use 2/3 of the 24 gallons, which is 16 gallons. So, we'll subtract 16 gallons from the total amount of water we're using: 26 gallons - 16 gallons = 10 gallons. Therefore, there are 10 gallons of water left.	10

25	Marie managed to buy a 12-dollar house, five 3-dollar apple cartons, three apples for $1.50 each, and a bag of pizza. Marie managed to buy everything for $50 each. If a bag of pizza costs $8.50, how many bags did Marie manage to buy?	2	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!) 

The total cost of the items Marie bought is $12 + 5 x $3 + 3 x $1.50 + $8.50 = $12 + $15 + $4.50 + $8.50 = $40. 

Marie had $50, so she had $50 - $40 = $10 left. Since a bag of pizza costs $8.50, she can buy 1 bag with the remaining money. 

Answer: Marie managed to buy 1 bag of pizza."	1
26	Marie bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of socks, and 3 pairs of shoes. A pair of shorts cost $16.50, a pair of socks cost $22.50 and a pair of shoes cost $42.

Moo, Marie yena $16.50 x 3 = $49.50, $22.50 x 3 = $67.50, and $42 x 3 = $126. Moo, Marie yena $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.	243
27	Cynthia eats the glass as a snack every night. She buys cartons of 15 snacks each, which cost $4.00 each. After 60 days of eating, how many bottles will she have to buy?	16	"Wena ukuthetha! (What's the question?)

Cynthia eats a glass (snack) every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 snacks.

Each carton has 15 snacks, so to find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the number of snacks she eats by the number of snacks in a carton:

60 snacks ÷ 15 snacks per carton = 4 cartons

So, Cynthia will have to buy 4 cartons of snacks."	4
28	Henry's two trips were unsuccessful and he had to drive 60 miles. His first rest was 20 miles, and he rested 15 miles before completing the trip.

31	Gunter tries to count the number of holes in each hole. He asks his friends to calculate the number of holes in the hole. One of them says 80. The other says he gave half as much as the one who gave 20. The third says he gave 25% more than the one who gave? What is the number of half as much as they gave?	80	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)

Ngiyabonga, ngiyabonga! (Thank you, thank you!)

Kuthetha ukuthetha, ngicela ukuthetha! (Let's count, let's count, I want to count!)

80 + 20 = 100 (one of them says 80, the other says half as much as the one who gave 20)

Half of 20 is 10 (the one who gave 20)

25% more than 10 is 12.5 (the third one says he gave 25% more than the one who gave 10)

So, the one who gave 10 gave half as much as the one who gave 20 (which is 80)

Answer: 10!"	10

33	Gretchen has 110 medals. The gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. How many gold medals does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Ah, kuthetha ngoku, ngicela ukuthula! (Let me think about this!) 

Gretchen has 110 medals in total. The gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. This means that if we subtract 30 from the total number of medals, we will get the number of silver medals. 

Let's do that: 110 - 30 = 80

So, Gretchen has 80 silver medals. Now, let's find the number of gold medals by adding 30 to the number of silver medals: 80 + 30 = 110

Gretchen has 80 silver medals and 30 more gold medals than silver medals. Therefore, Gretchen has 110 - 80 = 30 gold medals!"	30

39	A running horse is three times as fast as a walking horse, and if it stops it is twice as fast as a running horse. If it stops at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles can it run in one hour, if you know how it does 1/3 of its running time and 2/3 of its walking time?	18	"Nǐn hǎo! (Hello!) 

Ku tsoo ka ko tsoo, e ku tsoo ka ko tsoo, e ku tsoo ka ko tsoo. (Let me think, let me think, let me think.)

A running horse is three times as fast as a walking horse, so if a walking horse runs at x miles per hour, a running horse runs at 3x miles per hour.

If a running horse stops at a speed of 3 miles per hour, then it is twice as fast as a running horse, so a running horse runs at 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's say the running horse runs for 1/3 of an hour at 3x miles per hour, and then walks for 2/3 of an hour at x miles per hour. The total distance it covers is:

Distance = (1/3) × 3x + (2/3) × x
= x + (2/3) × x
= (5/3) × x

Since the running horse runs at 3x miles per hour, the total distance it covers in one hour is:

Distance = (5/3) × x × 1
= (5/3) × x

We know that the running horse stops at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so:

(5/3) × x = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3 × (3/5)
= 1.8

So the walking horse runs at 1.8 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the distance the running horse runs in one hour:

Distance = (1/3) × 3x × 1
= (1/3) × 3 × 1.8
= 1.8

Therefore, the running horse can run 1.8 miles in one hour."	1

42	Mrs. Jones cooked ten apple cakes to light the fire. Then she cut an eight-thousand-dollar cake and spread the cakes on the dining-table for someone to eat. When it was time for breakfast, all the cows had eaten their food, and there were fourteen thousand. How many thousand cows were there?	26	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I think there might be a slight mistake in the question. It seems like there's a mix-up with the numbers. Let me try to help you clarify.

If all the cows had eaten their food, and there were 14,000, that means there were 14,000 cows. But the question asks how many thousand cows there were. Since 14,000 is already in thousands, the answer would be 14.

43	According to a nutritionist, one bag of potato chips produces 250 calories of protein. If a 300-g bag produces 5 calories of protein, how many potato chips would you eat if you didn't know how many calories you would eat a day in 2000 if you had eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Wahala! (That's a problem!) 

Let's break it down:

1 bag of potato chips produces 5 calories of protein, and 1 bag weighs 300g.
To find out how many calories are in 1 potato chip, we'll divide the total calories by the weight of the bag:

5 calories ÷ 300g = 0.0167 calories per gram

Now, let's find out how many grams of potato chips are in 250 calories of protein:

250 calories ÷ 0.0167 calories per gram = 14,850 grams

Since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, we'll convert:

14,850 grams ÷ 1000 = 14.85 kilograms

Now, let's find out how many potato chips are in 14.85 kilograms:

Assuming an average potato chip weighs around 0.05 grams (this may vary depending on the brand and type), we'll divide:

14,850 grams ÷ 0.05 grams per chip = 297,000 potato chips

So, if you didn't know how many calories you would eat a day in 2000 and had already eaten 1,800 calories, you would eat approximately 297,000 potato chips! (Wahala indeed!)"	297000
44	Charlie wants to sell his meat-packing boxes. A hundred meat-packing boxes will make him make 10 brown meat-packing boxes. A book of meat-packing boxes costs $10.

52	Uriah's pocket was too heavy for him. he had to turn over a 15-pound sheet. a book weighing 1/4 of a pound and a child's pencil weighing 1/2 of a pound. if he had 30 books, how many would be left to solve the pencils?	15	"Oya, ngwana! (Ah, my child!) Let's do the math together.

First, let's find the total weight of the items Uriah had to turn over:

15 pounds (sheet) + 0.25 pounds (book) + 0.5 pounds (pencil) = 16 pounds

Since Uriah has 30 books, each weighing 0.25 pounds, the total weight of the books is:

30 books × 0.25 pounds/book = 7.5 pounds

Now, subtract the weight of the books from the total weight Uriah had to turn over:

16 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 8.5 pounds

This means Uriah has 8.5 pounds left to solve the pencils. To find out how many pencils he can solve, divide the remaining weight by the weight of one pencil:

8.5 pounds ÷ 0.5 pounds/pencil = 17 pencils

So, Uriah would have 17 pencils left to solve."	17

New price after increase: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Stéphane may raise the price by $4.00, so the new price would be: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Stéphane saved: $57.00 - $53.00 = $4.00

Width of the wall: 16 feet
Area of the ground: Let's call it x
Area of the roof: Half the area of the ground = x/2
Total area: x + x/2 = 3x/2

Now, let's find the width of the ground:
Width of the ground = √(Area of the ground) = √(3x/2)

Width of the ground = √(3x/2) = √(3x) / √2

Width of the ground = √(3x) / √2 = √(3x) * √2 / 2

Width of the ground = √(3x) * √2 / 2 = √(6x) / 2

So, the width of the ground is √(6x) / 2 feet.

76	Cecilia always buys a puppy. According to the veterinarian's recommendation, she must feed the puppy one bowl of food every 180 days. If she does, she must feed him 2 bowls of food every day for the rest of his life. Considering that her diet consists of 110 bowls, how many bowls of food does Cecilia feed the puppy each year?	5	"Kulani! (That's ""answer"" in Swahili!) 

Let's break it down:

The puppy needs 1 bowl of food every 180 days, which is equivalent to 0.5 bowls per day (1 bowl / 180 days).

Since Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 bowls of food per day, she needs to feed him 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 bowls of food per day for the rest of his life.

There are 365 days in a year, so Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1.5 bowls/day x 365 days/year = 547.5 bowls of food per year.

However, since Cecilia only feeds the puppy for a portion of the year (let's assume 10 years, since she always buys a new puppy), she needs to feed him 547.5 bowls/year x 10 years = 5475 bowls of food.

Now, let's consider her diet consists of 110 bowls. This means she has enough food for approximately 110 / 5475 ≈ 0.02 years (or about 7 days) of feeding the puppy.

So, to answer your question, Cecilia feeds the puppy approximately 547.5 bowls of food per year."	547

82	Grace weighs 25 pounds. Alex weighs less than twice as much as Grace weighs four times. How many pounds is the sum of your two weights?	623	"Nǐkí! (Thank you!)

Grace weighs 25 pounds.

Alex weighs less than twice as much as Grace weighs four times, so:

4 x 25 = 100
2 x 100 = 200
Alex weighs less than 200 pounds.

The sum of their weights is:
25 + less than 200 = 25 + 199 = 224 pounds.

93	In the morning, Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by more than two seconds over Gerald, but when Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by 38 seconds, how many seconds does Gerald run without changing his diet?	36	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unamandla. (Goodbye! Thank you for the power.)

Let's solve the problem:

Let's say Gerald's initial time without changing his diet is x seconds. Since Lee won by more than 2 seconds, Lee's initial time is x + 2.5 seconds (more than 2 seconds).

After Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%, which means his new time is 0.9x seconds.

Since Lee won by 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:

0.9x = x + 2.5 + 38

Subtract x from both sides:

0.9x - x = 2.5 + 38

0.1x = 40.5

Divide both sides by 0.1:

x = 405 seconds

So, Gerald's initial time without changing his diet is 405 seconds."	405

(Translation: The answer is 72, because if you add the number of dogs to the number of cats, it's like adding the number of households, and since there are 2 cats and 60 dogs, it's like adding 12 households, so there are 72 households.)	72
95	Of the 200 girls who made CM2, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are scouts. What is the percentage of girls who are not scouts?	40	"Mfana, ngumuntu ongumuntu! (Friend, listen!) 

Let's break it down:

* 2/5 of 200 are boys, so 80 are boys.
* 200 - 80 = 120 are girls.
* 2/3 of 120 are scouts, so 80 are scouts.
* 120 - 80 = 40 are not scouts.

To find the percentage, multiply the number of not scouts by 100 and divide by the total number of girls:

(40/120) * 100 = 33.33%

Mfana, ngumuntu ongumuntu! (Friend, listen!) The percentage of girls who are not scouts is 33.33%!"	33

Freda's last sauce cooking resulted in 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda cook?	12	"Wena ukuhlonipha! (I'll help you calculate!) 

Let's break it down:

* Freda takes 3 tomatoes for each 16-ounce bucket.
* She cooked 32 ounces of sauce, which is 2 buckets (since 16 x 2 = 32).
* For 2 buckets, Freda used 2 x 3 = 6 tomatoes.

So, Freda cooked 6 tomatoes!"	6
98	We are a group of women who live on a narrow strip of land. One of the women will be able to cross the 15 kilometers long road and then the other 20 women will cross the 15 kilometers long road. 5 women will take a detour to avoid crossing the narrow road. if the 30 kilometers long road had a fixed base, how many women will cross the 15 kilometers long road?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I can help you with that. 

Since one woman will cross the 15 kilometers long road and then the other 20 women will cross the same road, that makes a total of 21 women. 

However, we need to subtract the 5 women who took a detour to avoid crossing the narrow road. 

So, the total number of women who will cross the 15 kilometers long road is 21 - 5 = 16 women."	16

You are asking about the number of times the friends knocked on the door.)

Let's break it down:

1. The first person knocked 20 times.
2. The second person knocked 1/4 as many times as the first person, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 times.
3. The third person knocked 10 times as many as the second person, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 times.
4. You know the third person knocked 60 times, so that means the fourth person knocked 60 - 50 = 10 times.

So, the friends knocked a total of 20 + 5 + 50 + 10 = 85 times. But there is no mention of a dog shaking!"	85

Poppy had 1000 bronzes. She cut a third, which is 1000 / 3 = 333 bronzes. So, she had 667 bronzes left.

Then, her mother cut a third of the remaining bronze, which is 667 / 3 = 222 bronzes. So, Poppy's mother had 445 bronzes left.

To find out how much bronze was left to complete the process, subtract the bronze used from the original amount: 1000 - 333 - 222 = 445 bronzes.

Since each side is 1 inch wide, the area of each boyet is 120 square inches.

Jean has 3 boyets, so the total area is 3 × 120 = 360 square inches.

Since each side is 1 inch wide, the total length of all the boyets combined is 360 inches.

Ngicela ukuthetha ngoku, ngoku ke kuthetha ngoku. (Let me calculate this, I'll calculate this, I'll calculate this.)

108	Henri was preparing cookies that a cook had prepared for him. He wanted to make something twice as good as he had made before, but in the evening, he realized that he had made 15 more cookies than he had expected. After adding 5 biscuits, they were no longer refrigerated and now there were 110 biscuits. How many biscuits had Henri made before?	50	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) Let's solve this problem. 

Let's call the number of biscuits Henri made before ""x"". Since he wanted to make something twice as good, he made 2x biscuits. But, he made 15 more biscuits than he expected, so he actually made 2x + 15 biscuits.

After adding 5 more biscuits, he had a total of 110 biscuits. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 + 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 20 = 110

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2x = 90

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 45

So, Henri made 45 biscuits before!"	45

The funny thing is, since one day Béatrice found two large and 24 small black peppers, and Marcel has three large and 14 small black peppers. If each of us eats his own peppers, how much is half of what we eat?	45	Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's calculate this together. Béatrice has 2 large and 24 small black peppers, that's a total of 2 + 24 = 26 peppers. Marcel has 3 large and 14 small black peppers, that's a total of 3 + 14 = 17 peppers. In total, you have 26 + 17 = 43 peppers. If each of you eats your own peppers, that's 26 + 17 = 43 peppers eaten. Half of that is 43 / 2 = 21.5 peppers. So, half of what you eat is 21.5 peppers.	21

114	Jamal's telescope can hold up to six times as many birds as the forest of Brittany. The forest of Brittany can hold up to 50 times as many birds as the forest of plants, even if the canals are located in the same area where the animals are. If Jamal's telescope of the 1800s can hold a statue, how many statues can we find?	6	"Kwaku, sɛn nti! (Ah, my friend, listen! Let's break it down.)

Let's start with the forest of Brittany. It can hold 50 times as many birds as the forest of plants. So, the forest of plants can hold 1/50th of the birds that the forest of Brittany can hold. Since the forest of Brittany can hold an unknown number of birds, let's call that number x. Then, the forest of plants can hold x/50 birds.

Now, Jamal's telescope can hold 6 times as many birds as the forest of Brittany. So, it can hold 6x birds.

The problem also mentions that Jamal's telescope can hold a statue. But it doesn't specify how many statues it can hold. To find that out, we need to know how many birds it can hold in terms of statues.

Let's assume that each statue represents a certain number of birds. For simplicity, let's say each statue represents 10 birds. Then, Jamal's telescope can hold 6x/10 = 3x statues.

So, the answer is 3x statues. But we still don't know what x is! To find that out, we need more information."	3

How many couscous are in the package that Julia forgot?	10	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!)

Julia bought 1 pack of couscous, and her husband gave her another pack of 5 couscous. So, she had 1 + 5 = 6 packs of couscous.

She used 3 couscous to cook the meal, and then she used 12 couscous to cook the first meal. So, she used 3 + 12 = 15 couscous.

Since she had 6 packs of couscous, and she used 15 couscous, she has 6 - 15 = -9 couscous left.

But, you can't have a negative number of couscous! So, Julia must have forgotten to buy couscous. The answer is 9 couscous."	9

139	In a heat exchanger, there are more than twenty-two times the number of shallow cylinders and four times the number of shallow cylinders. If there are twelve shallow cylinders, how many shallow cylinders are there?	70	"Kwaku, ntama nipa! (That's a math problem, my friend!) 

Let's break it down: There are 12 shallow cylinders. It says there are more than 22 times the number of shallow cylinders. So, 22 x 12 = 264. But it also says there are four times the number of shallow cylinders. So, 4 x 12 = 48. 

Since 48 is less than 264, we know there are more than 48 shallow cylinders. But we need to find the exact number. Let's add 12 (the original number) to 48. 12 + 48 = 60. 

So, there are 60 shallow cylinders in the heat exchanger!"	60

153	Dave buys a large bag of chips, and eats nineteen of them from the hands of a crooked man. When the crooked man eats them, he destroys almost half of the chips Dave has eaten. Eventually, he is kicked out of the bag by three dogs, each of whom ends up eating three chips. After a while, a small demon steals three of the chips from the other dogs. The British take one and leave the five. How many chips were in the package when Dave got it?	48	"Mfana, ngikwazi ukuthi kubalwa ngokusemthethweni. (My friend, I know the answer is hidden.) Let's break it down:

Dave ate 19 chips.
The crooked man ate almost half of what Dave ate, so he ate around 9-10 chips.
The dogs ate 3 chips each, so they ate a total of 9 chips.
The small demon stole 3 chips from the dogs.
The British took 1 chip and left 5.

To find the total number of chips, let's add up what everyone ate:

Dave: 19
Crooked man: 9-10
Dogs: 9
Demon: 3
British: 1

Total chips eaten: 19 + 9 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 41

Since the British left 5 chips, the total number of chips in the package when Dave got it is:

41 + 5 = 46

Mfana, ngikwazi ukuthi kubalwa ngokusemthethweni. (My friend, the answer is hidden, but now it's revealed.) There were 46 chips in the package when Dave got it."	46
154	Kimo's classes are three one-hour classes; Tuesdays and Thursdays are two two-hour classes each day.

155	Every day, Bill makes 300 small loaves of bread, 120 chocolate loaves of bread, and 60 bagels of bread. Small loaves of bread, measured by the length of 4 fingers, are about the same size, chocolate loaves are about the same size, chocolate loaves are about the same size, and bagels are about 2 feet long. If Bill were to calculate the total amount of bread he makes for the entire company, how big would it be?	280	"Wena, ngiyabonga! (Ah, thank you!) Let me help you with that. First, let's calculate the total number of small loaves, chocolate loaves, and bagels Bill makes daily:

Small loaves: 300
Chocolate loaves: 120
Bagels: 60

Total number of loaves: 300 + 120 + 60 = 480

Now, let's calculate the total length of bread. Since small loaves are about the same size, measured by the length of 4 fingers, we can assume each small loaf is approximately 4 fingers long. Chocolate loaves are also about the same size, so each one is approximately 4 fingers long. Bagels are about 2 feet long, which is 8 fingers long (since 1 foot is equal to 2 hands, and each hand has 4 fingers).

Total length of small loaves: 300 x 4 fingers = 1200 fingers
Total length of chocolate loaves: 120 x 4 fingers = 480 fingers
Total length of bagels: 60 x 8 fingers = 480 fingers

Total length of all bread: 1200 fingers + 480 fingers + 480 fingers = 2160 fingers

Wena, ngiyabonga! (Ah, thank you!) The total length of bread Bill makes daily is approximately 2160 fingers."	2160

157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run 15 laps. We decide to do it in a 100-yard football game. Blake runs 15 laps, Kelly runs one and then announces that he doesn't want to run next to Blake. He starts running back and forth around the 40-yard line. He does it 34 times. How many chances does the winner have over the loser?	80	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungena igama lethu. (Hello! Thank you for speaking our language.)

Answer: Blake has 15 laps, Kelly has 34 runs around the 40-yard line. To calculate the total distance Kelly ran, we need to calculate the distance around the 40-yard line. Since it's a 100-yard football game, the 40-yard line is half the distance. Kelly ran 34 times around the 40-yard line, which means he ran 34 x 20 = 680 yards. To convert this to laps, we need to divide the total distance by 100 yards per lap. 680 yards / 100 yards per lap = 6.8 laps. Since Kelly only ran one lap initially, his total distance is 7.8 laps. Blake has 15 laps, and Kelly has 7.8 laps. To find the difference, subtract Kelly's laps from Blake's laps: 15 - 7.8 = 7.2 laps. Blake has 7.2 more laps than Kelly."	7

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippopotamuses and 3 species of fish, so he caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 sea creatures.

Locsin caught 5 starfish more than Anakin, so he caught 10 + 5 = 15 starfish. He caught 3 hippopotamuses more than Anakin, so he caught 6 + 3 = 9 hippopotamuses. He caught 2 species of fish more than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 species of fish.

In total, Locsin caught 15 + 9 + 5 = 29 sea creatures.

Together, they caught 19 + 29 = 48 sea creatures."	48

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. So each of us spends $3 on mangoes and $2 on sugar. We have 20 months of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 each month. If we make a bond of $25, how much will it cost to buy the mangoes?	15	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ukuthetha amabili! (Goodbye! Thank you for asking the question!)

To calculate the cost of buying mangoes, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Juan and Carlos make from selling lemonade. Since they sell each month for $0.50 and they have 20 months of lemonade, they make a total of:

20 months x $0.50 per month = $10

They then make a bond of $25, so they have a total of:

$10 (from selling lemonade) + $25 (from bond) = $35

Since they spend $3 on mangoes, the cost of buying mangoes is:

$35 (total amount) - $2 (sugar) = $33

So, it will cost $33 to buy the mangoes."	33

177	Zaid used 1/4 of his salary to pay for his apartment, 1/3 to pay for his wife and then gave it to his favorite charity fundraiser. He gave $200 to his daughter for her weekly medical expenses, and then $700 to his wife for toiletries and other household items. Since Zaid earns $6,000 a month, would you ask him to pay for the wedding and then give him all of that and everything else?	350	Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Zaid used 1/4 of his salary for the apartment, which is $1,500. He used 1/3 for his wife, which is $2,000. Then he gave $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. So, he spent $4,400. He has $6,000 - $4,400 = $1,600 left.	1600

Lord earned $10 per hour. In the first week, he taught for 5 hours, so he earned $10 x 5 = $50. In the second week, he taught for 8 hours, so he earned $10 x 8 = $80. In total, he earned $50 + $80 = $130. Ndiyakwena! (I'm done!)"	130

The winner receives 3/4 of the votes, which is 60 votes (since 3/4 of 80 is 60).

To find the number of votes for the loser, subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

80 - 60 = 20

So, the loser receives 20 votes. Ngiyakuthandaza!"	20
181	Sandra, who is shaking a piece of paper next to her, is very upset by the incompleteness of the paper that Fred has unrolled. Sandra has unrolled more than 4 times on red paper than on white paper. She has also unrolled 200 lists of colors, which is five times the amount of white paper. Sandra threatens to leave the seller if the seller doesn't return her with 17 hours of red paper left. While Sandra is at her clinic, which of the red papers does Sadra have to unroll before 17 hours?	160	"Sandra, ngwana wena, o ka kopa go tsamaya ke mang! (Sandra, my dear, you are really upset!) 

Let's break it down: Sandra has unrolled more than 4 times on red paper than on white paper. This means she has unrolled x times on red paper and x/4 times on white paper. She has also unrolled 200 lists of colors, which is five times the amount of white paper. So, we can set up the equation: x = 5 * (x/4) + 200

Solving for x, we get x = 280. This means Sandra has unrolled 280 times on red paper.

She threatens to leave the seller if the seller doesn't return her with 17 hours of red paper left. Since each unroll is an hour, Sandra has to unroll 280 - 17 = 263 times before 17 hours are left.

Sandra, ngwana wena, o ka kopa go tsamaya ke mang! (Sandra, my dear, you have to unroll 263 times before 17 hours are left!)"	17

186	Russell works in a veterinary clinic, distributing small animals with grass. The animals are weighed in 3 cups according to their size. For each animal we give him 6 pieces of grass. He has 10 pieces of hamsters. Each one has a coat on its head. We give him 5 pieces of grass. There is also a rule where we distribute 20 pieces of grass. We don't use a single piece of grass anywhere except in the clinic. If we distribute 160 pieces of grass to the small animals, what are the pieces of grass in the cup?	5	"Wena ukuthula! (Good day!) 

Let's break it down:

* Each hamster gets 6 pieces of grass, and there are 10 hamsters. So, 10 x 6 = 60 pieces of grass for the hamsters.
* We give 5 pieces of grass for each coat, and there are 10 hamsters with coats. So, 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of grass for the coats.
* We distribute 20 pieces of grass according to the rule.
* In total, we distribute 160 pieces of grass. So, subtracting the grass already given, we have 160 - 60 - 50 - 20 = 30 pieces of grass left.

Since we weigh the animals in 3-cup increments, and we have 30 pieces of grass left, we can divide 30 by 3 to get the number of cups: 30 ÷ 3 = 10 cups.

So, the answer is 10 cups of grass! Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	10

188	a salesman buys bags from a farmer for $20 each. If you take a bag from the farm to the store for $2, and all the bags are sold for $30 each to get a bonus of $400, how many bags do you sell?	50	"Nǐn wà shén me? (What's the question?)

Let's calculate:

Cost per bag: $20
Transportation cost: $2
Selling price: $30
Bonus: $400

Total revenue per bag: $30 (selling price) + $400 (bonus) = $430

Profit per bag: $430 (total revenue) - $20 (cost) - $2 (transportation) = $408

To find the number of bags sold, divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

$400 (bonus) / $408 (profit per bag) = 9.8 bags

Since you can't sell a fraction of a bag, round down to the nearest whole number:

9 bags

So, the salesman sells 9 bags."	9

Tomu 50 izinhle, ngoku-10 izinhle ekuhlaleni, ngoku-2 izinhle ekuhlaleni. Ngoku-10 izinhle ekuhlaleni, ngoku-50 + 10*10 - 2*10 = 60 izinhle. Ngoku-30% izinhle ekuhlaleni, ngoku-60 * 0.3 = 18 izinhle. Ngoku-60 - 18 = 42 izinhle. (Tom has 50 trees, he plants 10 trees a year, and prunes 2 trees a year. After 10 years, he has 50 + 10*10 - 2*10 = 60 trees. 30% of the trees died, so 60 * 0.3 = 18 trees died. 60 - 18 = 42 trees left.)"	42
193	Sue lives in a very peaceful environment. Within a few hours, her neighbors convince her that she is to blame. On Friday morning, they put about 18 green coffee beans in her fridge. Late in the morning, the neighbors picked up one of the three 18 green coffee beans that we had painted white and returned to Sue's fridge. The next morning, we added another 18 green coffee beans. At 12 o'clock in the morning, how many more green coffee beans were there than white coffee beans?	24	"Ndi ndi! (That's a tricky one!)

Sue's fridge initially had 18 green coffee beans. The neighbors added 18 more, making it 36. They then picked one of the 3 white coffee beans and returned it to the fridge. So, there are still 3 white coffee beans. To find the difference, subtract the number of white coffee beans from the number of green coffee beans: 36 - 3 = 33.

Therefore, there are 33 more green coffee beans than white coffee beans."	33

199	Marc is a mathematician. He calculates the number of hours per week for two different accounting firms that have different prices. The number of hours Marc spends with Accountant B is twice the number of hours Marc spends with Accountant A. Marc averages 1,000 hours per week. If Accountant A spends 5 fifty hours per week, how much money does Marc make in a week, in fifty?	7500	"Wena ke ngwana! (That's a good question!)

Let's break it down:

Marc spends 5 fifty hours per week with Accountant A, so that's 5 x 50 = 250 hours.

Since Marc spends twice as many hours with Accountant B, that's 2 x 250 = 500 hours.

Marc averages 1,000 hours per week, so the total hours spent with both accountants is 250 + 500 = 750 hours.

Accountant A charges 5 fifty hours per week, so Accountant B charges 2 x 5 = 10 fifty hours per week.

Marc makes 250 x 5 = 1,250 fifty with Accountant A and 500 x 10 = 5,000 fifty with Accountant B. That's a total of 1,250 + 5,000 = 6,250 fifty per week!

Weeks 5-7: 3 weeks x 2 runs per week = 6 runs
At 60 km/h, 1 run = 60 km, so 6 runs = 6 x 60 = 360 km

Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Since each bar of chocolate is twice the size of an apple, the weight of an apple is half the weight of a bar of chocolate.
Weight of an apple = 40 g / 2 = 20 g

She gets $4 from her parents for each dress with a wig. If she wants to buy a vest and shoes, which cost $30 + $20 = $50, she needs to make 13 dresses with a wig ($50 ÷ $4 = 13).

So, the cost of a dress with a wig is $4."	4
211	Jerry hunts a tiger. Red tigers hunt three tigers a day, white tigers hunt five a day. Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day. If the number of white tigers is more than the number of red tigers, how many red tigers are there?	4	"Wena ukuhlaza! (Let's think!) 

If Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day, and white tigers hunt 5 tigers a day, then the number of white tigers is 42 ÷ 5 = 8.4 (but we can't have a fraction of a tiger, so let's round down to 8 white tigers).

Since Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day, and white tigers hunt 5 tigers a day, the remaining tigers are hunted by red tigers. So, the number of red tigers is (42 - 5 × 8) = 42 - 40 = 2.

Wena ukuthula! (That's it!)"	2

213	At the one-dollar store, Sloane had 100 customers come in. The next day, there were 50 more customers than the previous day. If on the third day the number of customers was 500, how many customers did she lose that day?	250	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ukuthetha ngokuthula. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking a clever question.)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 50 more than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Day 3: 500 customers

To find out how many customers Sloane lost on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers she had on the second day from the number of customers she had on the third day:

500 (Day 3) - 150 (Day 2) = 350

So, Sloane lost 350 customers on the third day. Ngiyabonga ukuthetha ngokuthula! (Thank you for asking a clever question!)"	350

221	A water tank produces 120 litres of water. Céline uses 90 litres to water the parched garden. She then collects twice as much rainfall. How many litres of water is left in the tank now?	90	"Oooh, kwa nini? (Why?) Ah, okay! Let me calculate!

Initially, there were 120 litres of water. Céline used 90 litres, so that leaves 120 - 90 = 30 litres.

Then, she collects twice as much rainfall, which is 2 x 90 = 180 litres. So, she adds 180 litres to the remaining 30 litres.

Now, the total litres of water is 30 + 180 = 210 litres.

Kwa nini, Céline has 210 litres of water left in the tank!"	210

226	James collects Pokémon cards. There are 30 of them from indigenous peoples, 20 from herb-speaking peoples and 40 from water-speaking peoples. If he loses 8 of the water-speaking peoples and then buys 14 of the herb-speaking peoples, what is the probability that he chooses, without thinking, a water-speaking peoples?	33	"Mzuri sana! (That's great!)

Kwanza, tumesoma (first, let's count) the number of Pokémon cards James has:

Indigenous peoples: 30
Herb-speaking peoples: 20 + 14 = 34
Water-speaking peoples: 40 - 8 = 32

Jumla ya kadi zote: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Sasa, kuna kadi 32 za water-speaking peoples katika kadi 96. Kwa hiyo, changamoto ya kuchagua kadi ya water-speaking peoples bila kufanya kazi ni 32/96 = 1/3.

Hivyo, changamoto ya kuchagua kadi ya water-speaking peoples bila kufanya kazi ni 1/3. (So, the probability of choosing a water-speaking peoples without thinking is 1/3.)"	3

229	Ashlyn went to the farm for two months. She found that about 30% of the chickens we had raised were able to be weaned, so she took them home. When she returned, two weeks later, she weaned the rest of the chickens, which was 3/4 of the chickens we had raised. How many of the chickens hadn't been weaned for two weeks?	21	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I like that!) 

Let's break it down: Ashlyn raised some chickens, and 30% of them were weaned. That means 70% were not weaned. Then, when she returned, she weaned 3/4 of the remaining chickens. That means 1/4 of the remaining chickens were still not weaned.

Let's call the total number of chickens ""x"". Then, 0.7x (70% of x) were not weaned initially. Of these, 0.25(0.7x) = 0.175x were still not weaned after Ashlyn returned.

So, the answer is: 0.175x chickens hadn't been weaned for two weeks."	0
230	Marc bought 12 sets of shoes for his company's offices. Each pair was worth 20000§. He paid the shoes 10% of the leempo, and added another 1000 § for each pair of shoes.

249	Altogether, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her brother. Altogether, she ate twice as many cookies as her brother. Altogether, her brother ate five cookies in the morning and thirteen cookies in the morning. If one cookie has two hundred fruits, how many fruits does Sue eat more than her brother?	5,600	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her brother, and 2 times as many cookies as her brother. This means she ate 8 times as many cookies as her brother.

Her brother ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Sue ate 8 times as many cookies as her brother, so she ate 8 x 18 = 144 cookies.

The difference between what Sue and her brother ate is 144 - 18 = 126 cookies.

If one cookie has 200 fruits, then Sue ate 126 x 200 = 25200 more fruits than her brother."	25200
