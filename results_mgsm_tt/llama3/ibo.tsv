7	Carla downloads a two hundred GB file. It usually takes a minute to download two GB, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a reboot in order to introduce an update. which takes twenty minutes. Then Carla reboots to do the download. How long did it take to download the file?	160	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

It takes 1 minute to download 2 GB, so it takes 0.5 minutes to download 1 GB. The file is 200 GB, so it would take 0.5 x 200 = 100 minutes to download the file. But, Windows forces a reboot 40% of the way through the download, which is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. So, the download is 80 GB complete when the reboot occurs. The remaining 120 GB takes 0.5 x 120 = 60 minutes to download. The update takes 20 minutes, so the total time is 100 + 20 + 60 = 180 minutes."
8	John drives three hours at a 60mph convention and turns around because he realizes that he forgot to take an essential nap at home. He wants to get home in four hours but he spends the first two hours stuck in a queue of cars. He spends another half hour driving at a 30mph convention, before spending the remaining four hours at a 80mph convention. What is his rank at the end of those four hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

I calculate that John drives:

* 3 hours at 60mph = 180 miles
* 2 hours stuck in a queue = 0 miles
* 0.5 hours at 30mph = 15 miles
* 4 hours at 80mph = 320 miles

Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 320 = 515 miles

John's average speed for the last 4 hours is:

Total distance / Time = 320 miles / 4 hours = 80mph

Since he wants to get home in 4 hours, his rank at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance / Time = 515 miles / 4 hours = 128.75 mph

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
9	Eliza was paid $10.00 for the first 40 hours of work each week and 1.2 times her hourly wage. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?	460	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Eliza earns $10.00 per hour for the first 40 hours, so that's $400. For the remaining 5 hours, she earns 1.2 times her hourly wage, which is $12.00 per hour. So, she earns $60 for those 5 hours.

In total, Eliza earns $400 + $60 = $460."

The number of downloads in the second month was three times higher than the number of downloads in the first month, but then it increased to about 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the plans have in total over the three months?	366	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!)

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% increase from 180 = 0.3 x 180 = 54 downloads
Total downloads: 60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads.

12	Carlos grows an orange tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year he grows seven oranges, with a rat for $1.5. Each year it costs $3 to water and feed the plants. How many years does it take for him to start making money from the orange tree?	13	"Ndi ndi! (Ahah! Let me calculate!)

Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree, so that's a one-time expense.

Each year, he earns 7 oranges x $1.5 per orange = $10.50
But, he also spends $3 to water and feed the plants, so his annual profit is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

To break even, Carlos needs to make at least $90 in profit, since that's what he spent initially.

To find out how many years it takes, we can divide the initial cost by the annual profit:

$90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years

So, it takes Carlos 12 years to start making money from the orange tree!"
13	Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman who sells three green cleaning supplies, two red cleaning supplies, and half a dozen orange cleaning supplies.

15	A merchant wants to make a trade choice between two business plans: Gold is $5,000 or electronics is $8,000. His financial advisor expects metal sales to rise 2.5% while electronics will rise 1.2% in the same month. If this merchant wants to make the most profit at the end of the month by making a trade choice, what would this value be?	125	"Kwaku, kwa kwa! (That's the answer, my friend!) 

The merchant should choose the electronics option, which is expected to rise 1.2%. This is because 1.2% of $8,000 is $96, which is more than the 2.5% of $5,000, which is $125."

19	Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles. She walks 4 miles an hour and then another 2 miles an hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to go the rest of the way?	6	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

Marissa has already walked 12 miles. She walked 4 miles per hour for some time, so let's call that time t. Then she walked 2 miles per hour for some time, so let's call that time t2. 

Total distance = 12 miles
Distance at 4 miles per hour = 4t
Distance at 2 miles per hour = 2t2

Total distance = Distance at 4 miles per hour + Distance at 2 miles per hour
12 = 4t + 2t2

Now, Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. So, total distance = total time * average speed
12 = (t + t2) * 4

Now, let's solve for t and t2. 

From the first equation, 12 = 4t + 2t2
12 = 2t + t2

Subtract 2t from both sides
10 = t2

So, t2 = 10

Now, substitute t2 into the first equation
12 = 4t + 20
12 - 20 = 4t
-8 = 4t
-8/4 = t
-2 = t

So, t = -2. But time can't be negative, so t = 2.

Now, Marissa has walked 4 miles per hour for 2 hours, which is 8 miles. She has walked 2 miles per hour for 10 hours, which is 20 miles. 

She has already walked 8 + 20 = 28 miles. So, she has 12 - 28 = 4 miles left to walk.

She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so total distance = total time * average speed
4 = total time * 4
total time = 1

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour for 1 hour to achieve her average speed of 4 miles per hour.

In Yoruba, that is: Oya, Marissa ko fe ri iku 4 miles per hour fun awon ojo kan."
20	I have a gallon of orange juice of which two-thirds is water and I want to add a gallon of 15 gallons of orange juice of which three-fifths is water. But as I pour it, I lose a gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?	15	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. You have 1 gallon of orange juice with 2/3 water, which is 2/3 * 1 = 0.67 gallons of water.
2. You add 1 gallon of orange juice with 3/5 water, which is 3/5 * 1 = 0.6 gallons of water.
3. You lose 1 gallon of orange juice, so you're left with 24 - 1 = 23 gallons.
4. The total amount of water is the sum of the water in the initial gallon and the water in the added gallon, minus the water lost: 0.67 + 0.6 - 1 = 0.27 gallons of water.

So, there are 0.27 gallons of water left in 24 gallons."
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is 31 now, how long ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

Raymond was 23 when his son was born. Samantha is 31 now, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. So, Raymond was 25 when Samantha was born. Raymond's son was born 2 years after Raymond was 23, which is 21 years ago."
22	Billy sells DVDs. He had eight customers on Tuesday. His first three customers bought one DVD each. Two other customers bought two DVDs each. The last three customers didn't buy any DVDs.

23	A candle melts by two centimeters per hour of burning. How many centimeters will the candle shorten if it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?	8	Kwaku, ntse ntse! (That's simple!) The candle melts 2 cm per hour. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. So, the candle will shorten by 4 x 2 = 8 cm.
24	Kyle bought the best-selling book for $19.50. This included a 25% discount on the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Kwaku, kɛkɛ! (Ah, my friend, listen!) If the book was discounted by 25%, that means the discount is 25% of the original price. Let's call the original price ""x"". The discount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x. The discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.75x = 19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00!"
25	Marie bought a chicken dish for $12, five milk cartons for $3 each, four apples for $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizzas for a total of $50.

33	Gretchen has 111 coins. There are 30 gold coins more than silver. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Ndiyakuthanda! (I like it!) 

Gretchen has 111 coins. Let's call the number of silver coins ""x"". Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 111, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 111

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 111

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 81

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.5

But we can't have a fraction of a coin, so we round down to the nearest whole number: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70

Ndiyakuthanda! Gretchen has 70 gold coins!"

37	John plans to sell his toys and use the money to buy a set of video games. He has 13 sets of Lego bricks that he sells for $15 each. Later, he buys eight sets of Lego bricks for $20 each and has $5 left. How many Lego bricks does he have left?	2	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

John has 13 sets of Lego bricks that he sells for $15 each. So he gets 13 x 15 = 195 dollars. Then he buys 8 sets of Lego bricks for $20 each, which costs 8 x 20 = 160 dollars. He has 195 - 160 = 35 dollars left. Since he has 5 dollars left, he spent 35 - 5 = 30 dollars. So he bought 30 / 20 = 1.5 sets of Lego bricks.

41	The giant dragon, Perg, sat atop Farbo's mountain, breathing fire on everything from a distance of a thousand feet. Polly was able to shoot a gold javelin, the only magic weapon that would kill the dragon, for a distance of four hundred feet, while the dragon's fire also reached well. But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she would hit the javelin three times as hard as when she didn't have the gemstone. If she used the gemstone, how fast would Polly stand upright and hit the javelin dragon?	200	"Moo nna, ngwana wa kgosi! (Ah, my child, this is a puzzle!)

Let's break it down:

* Perg, the dragon, sits 1000 feet away from Polly.
* Polly's javelin can reach 400 feet without the gemstone.
* With the gemstone, Polly's javelin will hit 3 times harder, but the distance remains the same, 400 feet.
* The dragon's fire also reaches 1000 feet.

To hit the dragon, Polly needs to reach the dragon from a distance of 1000 feet. Since her javelin can only reach 400 feet without the gemstone, she needs to find a way to increase the distance.

With the gemstone, Polly's javelin will hit 3 times harder, but the distance remains the same, 400 feet. To reach the dragon, Polly would need to move closer to the dragon, which is not possible since the dragon's fire also reaches 1000 feet.

Therefore, Polly cannot stand upright and hit the dragon even with the gemstone. She would need to find another way to reach the dragon or come up with a new strategy.

Moo nna, ngwana wa kgosi, ke tlogelwa! (Ah, my child, the puzzle is tricky!)"

51	Tom's boat will travel at a speed of ten miles per hour. He drives from 1 to 4PM. He returns at a speed of 6 mph. How long does it take him to get back?	5	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!)

Tom's boat travels at 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. Then, he returns at 6 miles per hour. To find the time it takes him to get back, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Since the distance is the same for both trips, we can use the distance from 1 to 4 PM, which is 10 miles (4 - 1 = 3 hours, and 3 hours * 10 mph = 30 miles).

Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

53	A car repairman charges different fees to repair a flat tire on a car. A car repairman charges $60 for each flat tire he repairs, a car repairman charges $40. On Tuesday, a car repairman repairs six flat tires and four flat tires. On Friday, a car repairman repairs 12 flat tires but no flat tires. How much more money does a car repairman earn on a typical day of repair?	40	"Sabi! (I know!)

On Tuesday, the car repairman earns:
6 flat tires x $60 = $360
4 flat tires x $40 = $160
Total: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the car repairman earns:
12 flat tires x $60 = $720 (but there are no flat tires, so he earns $0)

The difference in earnings is:
$520 (Tuesday) - $0 (Friday) = $520

So, the car repairman earns $520 more on a typical day of repair."

57	A wooden bed and a rack of no more than five thousand pounds. A service cart full of identical boxes, each weighing fifteen pounds, will cross the bed. The total weight of the driver on the cart is at least three thousand seven hundred and fifty-five pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed?	83	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed is:

5000 (bed weight limit) - 3755 (driver weight) = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight by 15 to find the maximum number of boxes:

1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 82.33 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart is 82."

76	Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she will feed the puppy one cup of dog food a day for the first 800 days. Then she will start feeding the puppy two cups of dog food a day for the rest of her life. If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many dog food bags will Cecilia use for the first dish?	5	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

For the first 800 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 800 cups of dog food. Then, she will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of her life. Let's calculate the number of days left in her life:

Let's assume Cecilia lives for 80 years (a reasonable assumption, considering the average human lifespan). There are approximately 365.25 days in a year, so:

80 years × 365.25 days/year ≈ 29,220 days

Subtract the first 800 days:

29,220 days - 800 days ≈ 28,420 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia will feed her puppy:

800 cups (for the first 800 days) + 28,420 days × 2 cups/day ≈ 57,320 cups

Since one dog food bag contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups by 110:

57,320 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag ≈ 520.18 bags

So, Cecilia will use approximately 520 dog food bags for the first 800 days."

3. The third friend knocked 10 times more than the fourth, so let's call the fourth friend's knocks x. Then, the third friend knocked x + 10 times.
4. The fourth friend knocked 60 times.

Now, we can set up an equation:

x + 10 = x + 60

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

10 = 60

This doesn't make sense, so let's re-examine the problem. Maybe the third friend knocked x - 10 times instead?

x - 10 = x + 60

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

-10 = 60

This still doesn't make sense. Let's try again. Maybe the third friend knocked x + 10 times instead?

x + 10 = x + 60

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

10 = 60

Wait, this still doesn't make sense! Let's try again. Maybe the third friend knocked 2x times instead?

2x = x + 60

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

x = 60

So, the fourth friend knocked 60 times, and the third friend knocked 2x = 2(60) = 120 times.

The second friend knocked one-fourth as many times as the first, which is 20 ÷ 4 = 5 times.

The first friend knocked 20 times.

John has three baskets. Each basket is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the sides are one inch thick, we need to add 2 inches to each dimension to get the total volume.

5 inches + 2 inches = 7 inches (length)
6 inches + 2 inches = 8 inches (width)
4 inches + 2 inches = 6 inches (height)

So, the volume of each basket is 7 inches x 8 inches x 6 inches = 336 cubic inches.

Since John has three baskets, the total volume is 3 x 336 cubic inches = 1008 cubic inches.

111	Julia's boat began to lose its way when it left the lake. The boat took 2 liters of water to reach the bottom of the lake. It took 16 seconds to reach 20 feet. The bottom was 64 seconds away. How much water did the boat take when Julia reached the bottom?	16	"Ko kiri ko! (That's a tough one!) 

Let's break it down: 

The boat took 2 liters of water to reach the bottom of the lake. This means the boat consumed 2 liters of water to travel the distance from the top to the bottom of the lake. 

Now, let's look at the time it took to reach the bottom. It took 64 seconds to reach the bottom, and it took 16 seconds to reach 20 feet. This means that for every 16 seconds, the boat travels 20 feet. 

To find the distance from the top to the bottom of the lake, we can set up a proportion: 

16 seconds / 20 feet = x seconds / total distance 

We can cross-multiply: 

16x = 64 * 20 

Simplifying, we get: 

16x = 1280 

Dividing both sides by 16, we get: 

x = 80 

So, the total distance from the top to the bottom of the lake is 80 feet. 

Now, we can find the amount of water the boat took to reach the bottom: 

2 liters / 20 feet = x liters / 80 feet 

We can cross-multiply: 

2 * 80 = x * 20 

Simplifying, we get: 

160 = 20x 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: 

x = 8 

So, the boat took 8 liters of water to reach the bottom of the lake.

Sasha had 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 trees that cost $10 each, so she spent $800. She had 4 x 4 x 10 = 160 trees that cost $16 each, so she spent $2560. In total, she spent $3360.

She sold all the trees for $10 each, so she made $800. She sold all the trees for $16 each, so she made $2560. In total, she made $3360.

123	Rosie had to run 10 miles per hour for three hours; then she ran five miles per hour; how many more miles could she run in seven hours?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Rosie ran 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she ran 10 x 3 = 30 miles.

Then she ran 5 miles per hour, but we don't know for how long. Let's call that time x hours. So, she ran 5x miles.

In total, she ran 30 + 5x miles.

She wants to know how many more miles she can run in 7 hours at 5 miles per hour. That's 5 x 7 = 35 miles.

So, she can run 35 - (30 + 5x) miles more.

Since she's already run 30 miles, 30 + 5x = 30 + 5(7 - 3) = 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

So, she can run 35 - 50 = -15 miles less. But we can't run a negative distance, so she's already done her running for the day!

(Thank you!) 

Kwaku kwaku! (Let me think...) 

If Jennie has stamped one-third of the letters that need stamping, and there are now 30 letters in the pool of stamped letters, that means she has stamped 30 letters. 

To find out how many letters she has left to stamp, we need to find out what one-third of the total number of letters is. 

Let's call the total number of letters ""x"". 

One-third of x is x/3. 

We know that x/3 = 30, so we can solve for x. 

x = 30 x 3 = 90. 

So, there were 90 letters in the pool when Jennie started."

129	A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the hospital and hospitals charge patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?	10000	"Ngiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total time spent by patients in the hospital:

500 patients x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

 Convert minutes to hours:

12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours

Doctors' charges: 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000

Hospital charges: 200 hours x $200 per hour = $40,000

Total revenue: $30,000 (doctors) + $40,000 (hospital) = $70,000

Total time spent by patients: 200 hours

Total profit: $40,000 (hospital's revenue) - (doctors' revenue + hospital's costs) = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

If one-third of the workers quit, that means 33.33% (approximately) left. If ten percent quit, that means 10% (approximately) left. So, 33.33% + 10% = 43.33% left. 

Nnoma, elli elli elli! (Ah, I see!)

* 2 soaps for $7.50 each = $15.00
* 2 bags of gum for $1.50 each = $3.00
* 2 cookies for $1.00 each = $2.00
* Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

If she makes a voluntary donation of $5.00, the total cost will be:

$20.00 + (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

So, the total cost would be $24.00."

143	John bought milk for two dollars, eggs for three dollars, a light bulb for three dollars, a glass for three dollars, and a firecracker for four dollars. If there is a 10% tax on non-food items, how much is everything?	16	"Kwaku, sɛn nipa wo din deɛ! (Ah, my friend, I'll calculate it for you!)

Milk: 2 dollars (food item, no tax)
Eggs: 3 dollars (food item, no tax)
Light bulb: 3 dollars (non-food item, 10% tax) = 3.30 dollars
Glass: 3 dollars (non-food item, 10% tax) = 3.30 dollars
Firecracker: 4 dollars (non-food item, 10% tax) = 4.40 dollars

Total: 2 + 3 + 3.30 + 3.30 + 4.40 = 16.60 dollars

Kwaku, sɛn nipa wo din deɛ! (Ah, my friend, the total is 16.60 dollars!)"
144	Kim had started a home security business and was calculating how much profit she would make from her clients. She already had three clients, but she was talking to five other clients and was so trusting that she included them in her conventions. Each client's house would require two bottles of blich and a laundry bag. The blich bottle would cost $2 and the laundry bag would cost $5 for one. This was her only budget. She calculated that her total weekly income would be $92. What is the difference between the profit made and the money spent, so how many dollars would Lucas make per week?	20	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Kimu yabonga ukuba yakhetha i- profit yayo. (Kim is happy to calculate her profit.) 

Let's calculate the total cost of the blich and laundry bags for each client:

3 clients (already signed up) = 3 x (2 bottles of blich x $2 + 1 laundry bag x $5) = 3 x ($4 + $5) = 3 x $9 = $27

5 additional clients (included in the calculation) = 5 x (2 bottles of blich x $2 + 1 laundry bag x $5) = 5 x ($4 + $5) = 5 x $9 = $45

Total weekly cost = $27 + $45 = $72

Since her total weekly income is $92, her profit would be:

$92 (weekly income) - $72 (weekly cost) = $20

So, Kim would make a profit of $20 per week."
145	John has 10 hectares of cornfields. There are 100 cornfields per hectare. John will harvest his cornfields every 3 months. How many cornfields will John harvest in a year?	4000	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) John will harvest 10 x 100 = 1000 cornfields per harvest. Since he harvests every 3 months, he will harvest 4 times in a year. So, John will harvest 1000 x 4 = 4000 cornfields in a year.

147	Debra observed the number of bees coming and going in a day. She saw thirty bees leaving the zoo in the first six hours, and she saw that one-half and many bees returned in the next six hours. She saw twice as many bees as she had previously seen leaving the zoo flying out of the zoo and leaving in the next six hours. When any of the bees that had not returned returned returned to the zoo in the next six hours. How many animals did Debra see return to the zoo in the last six hours of the day?	75	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) I'd be happy to help you with that.

First, let's break it down:

* 30 bees left the zoo in the first 6 hours.
* In the next 6 hours, half of those bees (15) returned, and many more bees returned. Let's call the number of bees that returned ""x"". So, the total number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours is 15 + x.
* In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees left the zoo as had left in the first 6 hours. So, 2 x 30 = 60 bees left the zoo.
* Finally, any bees that had not returned returned to the zoo in the next 6 hours. This means that the bees that left the zoo in the last 6 hours (60) are the ones that had not returned.

Now, let's think about it: if 60 bees left the zoo in the last 6 hours, and they are the ones that had not returned, then they must be the ones that returned to the zoo in the last 6 hours.

So, the answer is: 60 bees returned to the zoo in the last 6 hours. Ndiyabonga!"
148	Brittany and her mother go to an art museum. The entrance fee is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gives the collector a ticket for a child and a ticket for an adult. If she receives a change of $8, how much, in dollars, did she help the collector?	30	Wena wena! (Ah ah!) Ukuthetha ukuthetha! (Let's calculate!) Ukuthetha ukuthetha, Brittany's mother gave a ticket for an adult (12 dollars) and a ticket for a child (10 dollars). Ukuthetha ukuthetha, that's a total of 22 dollars. Ukuthetha ukuthetha, she received a change of 8 dollars. Ukuthetha ukuthetha, that means she helped the collector with 22 - 8 = 14 dollars!

150	Steve lives three miles from school and has a bicycle speed of 440 beats per minute. Tim lives two miles from school. If Tim has a skateboard speed of 264 beats per minute, how long will the winner be at home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Ko ko! (Ah ah!) 

Steve's speed: 440 beats per minute
Steve's distance: 3 miles
Steve's time: 3 miles / 440 beats per minute = 0.06875 hours = 4.125 minutes

Tim's speed: 264 beats per minute
Tim's distance: 2 miles
Tim's time: 2 miles / 264 beats per minute = 0.075 hours = 4.5 minutes

Winner's time: 4.125 minutes
Loser's time: 4.5 minutes
Winner will be at home: 4.125 minutes - 4.5 minutes = -0.375 minutes = -22.5 seconds before loser finishes the race.

151	Shawnda decided that her neighborhood kids could actually use the air conditioning service on bicycles. She decided that the best way to pay the bills was with tires. Each tire cost 25 cents to put air in. On the first day, five people on bicycles came to put air in both tires. Three came to put air in all three horse tires. Finally, one person actually came on a horse. How much money did he make that day?	5	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili)

Shawnda made a total of:

* 5 people x 2 tires x 25 cents = $2.50
* 3 people x 3 tires x 25 cents = $3.75
* 1 person x 0 tires x 25 cents = $0.00

Total: $2.50 + $3.75 = $6.25"

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, each with 6 loaves of bread. That's a total of 10 x 6 = 60 loaves of bread. At $0.10 per loaf, the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, he would get $4.00 in change."
153	Dave bought a large package of french fries and ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. When the seagull came down, he quickly ate half of Dave's french fries. Three pigeons snatched it and the food, each pigeon ate three french fries. Then, the pigeon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. The last ant took out the remaining french fries, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the package when Dave bought it?	48	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ukubonga ukuthi umelela isikhathi! (I'll help you solve this problem!)

Let's break it down:

1. Dave ate 14 fries, leaving the package with x - 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, so it ate (x - 14) / 2 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
4. The pigeons stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so they stole (x - 14 - (x - 14) / 2 - 9) x 2/3 fries.
5. The last ant took out the remaining fries, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's set up the equation:

(x - 14) - ((x - 14) / 2) - 9 - (2/3)((x - 14 - (x - 14) / 2 - 9)) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 14 - x/2 - 9 - 2x/3 + 14/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x/6 = 10

Multiply both sides by 6:

x = 60

So, there were 60 french fries in the package when Dave bought it!"

156	A zookeeper who feeds a human in a zoo. He counts all the bananas from a nearby farm every two months. If a monkey needs 200 bananas, a rooster needs 400 bananas and a frog needs 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should he buy to have a mouse for two months?	1400	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ngoku! (Hello! Thank you for asking!)

To find the total number of bananas needed for two months, we need to calculate the number of bananas needed for each animal per month and multiply it by 2.

Monkey: 200 bananas/month x 2 = 400 bananas
Rooster: 400 bananas/month x 2 = 800 bananas
Frog: 100 bananas/month x 2 = 200 bananas

Total bananas needed for two months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper should buy 1400 bananas to have a mouse for two months!"

Let's break it down:

* They make $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar per gallon, so total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
* They get 20 cups per gallon, and each cup is $0.50, so total revenue per gallon is 20 x $0.50 = $10.
* They make a profit of $25, so their total revenue minus total cost should equal $25.
* Total revenue is $10 per gallon, and they don't know how many gallons they made, so let's call the number of gallons x.
* Total revenue is $10x, and total cost is $5x, so $10x - $5x = $25.
* Simplifying, we get $5x = $25, so x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.
* Since they spent $5 per gallon, they spent $5 x 5 = $25 on lemonade.

Ndi nji! (That's the answer!)"
176	Of the 240 Asian athletes, 80 were Japanese, and the rest were Chinese. If there are 60 boys, how many girls?	100	"Wena ukuthi? (What's the question?)

177	Zaid spends one-fourth of his salary on rent, one-third on gasoline and donates half of the rest to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter $200 to cover his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for a budget for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Zaid's salary: $6000

Rent: $6000 / 4 = $1500

Gasoline: $6000 / 3 = $2000

Remaining: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500

Donation to charity: $2500 / 2 = $1250

Remaining: $2500 - $1250 = $1250

Expenses for daughter: $200
Expenses for wife: $700

Total expenses: $200 + $700 = $900

Remaining: $1250 - $900 = $350

178	Rani has ten more than Monic, whose number is four less than Bo's. If Bo has forty, calculate the total number of connections the three people have together.	122	Kwaku, Rani efiase 10, Monic efiase 4 less than Bo, Bo efiase 40. Rani efiase 40 + 10 = 50. Monic efiase 40 - 4 = 36. Rani and Monic efiase 50 + 36 = 86. Rani and Bo efiase 50 + 40 = 90. Monic and Bo efiase 36 + 40 = 76. Total connections efiase 86 + 90 + 76 = 252.

180	If the winner receives three-fourths of the votes cast in a class of 80 students, how many votes does the loser get?	20	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) If the winner receives three-fourths of the votes cast, that means the winner gets 80 x 3/4 = 60 votes. The total number of votes is 80, so the loser gets 80 - 60 = 20 votes. Ngiyabonga!
181	Sandra, a neighborhood florist, is unhappy that having Fred isn't enough. Sandra sells four times as many red roses as white carnations. She sells 200 pink calla lilies, five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to change suppliers if she doesn't bring the missing red roses by 5 p.m. To save Sandra's business, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver by 5 p.m.?	160	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem together. Let's say the number of white carnations Sandra sells is x. Since Sandra sells four times as many red roses as white carnations, she sells 4x red roses.

We know Sandra sells 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. So, 200 = 5x.

To find the number of white carnations, we can divide both sides by 5: x = 200/5 = 40.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of red roses: 4x = 4(40) = 160.

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 p.m. to save Sandra's business. Ngiyabonga!"

Cost of transportation per sack = $2
Total profit = $400
Profit per sack = $30 - $2 = $28

= 14.29 (round down to 14, since you can't sell a fraction of a sack)

So, the merchant sold 14 sacks of wheat!"
189	Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets for the show. They spent $4.50 more on food than on tickets. They also went on two separate rides that cost $33 each. If they decided to divide the total cost equally, how much did each person pay?	34	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!)

Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets. That's $6.75 per ticket. They spent $4.50 more on food than on tickets, so they spent $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75 on food. The total cost of the rides was $33 x 2 = $66. Adding this to the cost of the tickets and food, we get $20.25 + $24.75 + $66 = $111.

Since they split the cost equally, each person paid $111 ÷ 3 = $37."

191	A duck needs to eat three to five pounds of meat each week to survive. If there are ten ducks, how many pounds of meat do they need to eat each day?	5	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) According to the calculation, the ducks need to eat 3-5 pounds of meat per week. Since there are 10 ducks, the total amount of meat needed per week is 30-50 pounds. To find out how much they need to eat each day, we can divide this amount by 7. So, the ducks need to eat 4.3-7.1 pounds of meat each day.
192	Tom plants ten trees in a row. Each row he cuts down two trees per row. He started with fifty trees. After ten years 30% of the trees died. How many trees did he have left?	91	"Mfana, Tom uyalwa ngokuthula! (My friend, Tom has a problem!)

Tom started with 50 trees. He planted 10 trees, so he had 50 + 10 = 60 trees. He cut down 2 trees per row, so he cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. That leaves him with 60 - 20 = 40 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees died. 30% of 40 is 0.3 x 40 = 12 trees. So, Tom had 40 - 12 = 28 trees left.

Mfana, Tom uyalwa ngokuthula! (My friend, Tom has a problem!)"
193	On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in front of Sue's house. On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned a third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted flamingos back in front of Sue's house.

On Sunday afternoon, how many more pink plastic flamingos were taken out than white plastic flamingos?	24	"Ndi ndi, ndi ndi! (That's the answer, my friend!) 

The neighbors took out 6 white plastic flamingos on Saturday morning, and then added 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sunday morning. So, on Sunday afternoon, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos taken out, and 6 white plastic flamingos. That means 18 - 6 = 12 more pink plastic flamingos were taken out than white plastic flamingos."
194	Violetta wants to buy a new oatmeal. She wants them in different colors and has spent $20 to buy this one. One oatmeal costs $2. How much money will she get?	10	Violetta, nini yini? (What's the news?) Violetta spent $20 on oatmeal, and each oatmeal costs $2. To find out how many oatmeal she bought, we can divide $20 by $2. That's 20 ÷ 2 = 10. So Violetta bought 10 oatmeals. Now, let's calculate how much change she will get. She spent $20, and each oatmeal costs $2. So, she will get $20 - (10 x $2) = $20 - $20 = $0. Violetta will not get any change because she spent all her money!

198	Elaine started out with 20 Pokemon cards. A month later, she received three times that number. The second month, she received 20 fewer than the first month. The third month, she received twice as many Pokemon cards as the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Wena ngiwu! (I understand!)

Elaine started with 20 cards. A month later, she got 3 times that, which is 20 x 3 = 60. So she had 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

The second month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40. So she now has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

The third month, she got twice as many as the first and second months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200. So she now has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

201	John receives a bonus at work. This bonus consists of a one-time payment of $5000 plus a 5% increase in salary. If he receives 2000 a week, every week of the year and he receives a bonus on the first day of the year how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) John ukuthula kakhulu! (John has a big gain!)

First, let's calculate the one-time payment: $5000

Next, let's calculate the 5% increase in salary: 5% of $2000 is $100 per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total increase is: $100 x 52 = $5200

Now, let's add the one-time payment and the increased salary: $5000 + ($2000 x 52) + $5200 = $5000 + $104000 + $5200 = $110200

So, John earned a total of $110,200 that year!"

He ate cheese and omelet for breakfast three days a week with one more piece for each omelet than a sandwich. He cooked a large meal of macaroni and cheese to steal his dinner for the week and used 8 pieces of cheese in it. How many pieces of cheese did he use?	31	Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Carl used 2 pieces of cheese for each sandwich, which is 7 sandwiches, so that's 14 pieces. For breakfast, he used 1 more piece per omelet than a sandwich, so that's 3 pieces for each of 3 omelets, which is 9 pieces. For dinner, he used 8 pieces. In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 pieces of cheese. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's evening class. Mr. Bert gives six exams in each semester. He allows students to remove the maximum and average marks in each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five exams, what score would he need in the sixth exam to get an average of 93?	98	"Nǐ kwa kwa! (That's a good one!)

To find the maximum and average marks, we need to calculate the total marks first. The total marks for the first five exams are:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

To get an average of 93, the total marks should be:

6 * 93 = 558

So, Brinley needs a score of:

558 - 438 = 120

in the sixth exam to get an average of 93."
206	Michael loved cycling. He gave it a try five times a week and rode 25 kilometers each time.

Michael alikuwa akivaa baisikeli. Alivaa kwa wiki 5 na kuendesha 25 km kwa wiki. Alifanya hivyo kwa wiki 4, kisha akaamua kuendesha baisikeli kwa wiki 2, lakini kwa km 60 kwa wiki, na alifanya hivyo kwa wiki 3. Jumla ya km Michael alivaa ni 25 x 4 + 60 x 3 = 100 + 180 = 280 km.
207	The Halloween Joe bag contains 25 chocolates and 80 apples. Each chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple. If each chocolate weighs 40g, how many bags of Joe's are there, in grams?	2600	"Ndi mawu! (I understand!) 

To find the total weight of each bag, we need to find the total weight of the chocolates and apples separately.

The weight of each chocolate is 40g, and there are 25 chocolates, so the total weight of the chocolates is:

25 x 40g = 1000g

The weight of each apple is half of the weight of each chocolate, which is 20g. There are 80 apples, so the total weight of the apples is:

80 x 20g = 1600g

The total weight of each bag is the sum of the weight of the chocolates and apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

So, there are 2600g in each bag."

Her grandmother pays her $4 for every time she cleans the house. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts taking care of the children, how many times will she have to clean the house before she can afford to buy the jacket and shoes?	10	Ngiyabonga! Sara needs $30 + $20 = $50 for the jacket and shoes. She already has $10. She earns $5 for each time she takes care of the kids, so she needs to take care of the kids $50 - $10 = $40 / $5 = 8 times. She also earns $4 for each time she cleans the house, so she needs to clean the house ($40 - $10) / $4 = 6 times.
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red hen lays three eggs a day and the white hen lays five eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Ndiyo, nini? (Yes, what?) Ah, Jerry has a flock of chickens! Let's solve this problem together.

Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The red hen lays 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x.

The white hen lays 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10.

The total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + (5x + 10) = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide by 8:

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens!"

214	Jerry has two ponds, both with openings that discharge about four gallons of water per minute. Four minutes would have gone by, the larger pond has twice the water capacity of the smaller pond. Now the larger pond has four times the water capacity of the smaller pond. How much water is in the smaller pond?	8	"Ndi nyalako! (I understand!)

Kwaku, ndi ku ndi ku! (Let me calculate!)

The smaller pond has some water, let's call it x gallons.

The larger pond has twice the water capacity, so it has 2x gallons.

After 4 minutes, the smaller pond has 4x gallons and the larger pond has 8x gallons.

Since the larger pond has four times the water capacity of the smaller pond, we can set up the equation: 8x = 4(4x)

Solving for x, we get: x = 4 gallons

So, the smaller pond has 4 gallons of water!"

219	Four students scored a total of 251 points in the board game; Naomi scored 68; Yuri scored 10 more than half, and Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.	54	"Ndi ndi! (That's correct!)

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half of 251, which is 125.5. Since you can't score half a point, Yuri scored 125 points.

Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 85 points. Since Naomi scored 68 points, Brianna scored 17 points, which is 85 - 68 = 17.

So, the scores are:

* Naomi: 68
* Yuri: 125
* Brianna: 17"

If he throws away 8 of green and buys 14 of green, what is the percentage chance (corrected to the nearest number) that the randomly selected card will be water?	33	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungenisa izito. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking the question.)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has: 30 (light) + 20 (green) - 8 (green) + 40 (water) + 14 (green) = 96 cards.

The number of water cards is 40. To find the percentage, divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:

(40 ÷ 96) × 100 ≈ 41.7%

So, the percentage chance that the randomly selected card will be water is approximately 42%."

Two sausages: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total cost of add-ons: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50
Total cost of the burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00
Promotion: $3.00
Total cost after promotion: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00
Gift card: $5.00

In total, it will take 90 + 180 = 270 minutes for both Calendar and Mother to complete the puzzle."
229	One watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn visited the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she planted them. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	"Ndi nyalani! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

30% of 120 is 36 (30% of 120 = 0.3 x 120 = 36).

So, Ashlyn planted 36 watermelons.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84.

Now, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.

3/4 of 84 is 63 (3/4 of 84 = 0.75 x 84 = 63).

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons.

Remaining watermelons = 84 - 63 = 21.

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two weeks.

Ndi nyalani! (I understand!)"
230	Mark purchased 12 motorcycles for his company. One of the cars cost $20,000. He paid 10% interest on the cars plus an additional $1000 to register one of them. How much did he pay for all the parts?	276,000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

239	The hall has three entrances A, B, and C that also serve as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students left the hall through exit A, the remaining three-fifths through exit B, and the rest through exit C, calculate the number of students who left through exit C.	280	"Ndi ndi! (I'll answer!)

If 30% of the students left through exit A, that means 70% of the students remained. If three-fifths of the remaining students left through exit B, that means 2/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. So, 2/5 of 70% of the students left through exit B.

Let's calculate the number of students who left through exit B: 2/5 of 70% = 28%.

Now, we know that 30% left through exit A and 28% left through exit B. That means 62% of the students left through exit A and exit B. Since 100% - 62% = 38%, 38% of the students left through exit C.

So, the number of students who left through exit C is 38% of the total number of students."

If one cookie has two hundred calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm glad to help!)

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.
On Tuesday, she ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Difference in cookies: 46 - 18 = 28 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 28 x 200 = 5600 calories more than her sister.
