4	Every day, Wendi gives each of his chickens three bowls of chicken food, with fruits, nuts and vegetables to keep them safe. He gives the chickens their chicken food three different times. In the morning, he gives his flock 15 bowls of chicken food. In the afternoon, he gives the chickens another 25 bowls of chicken food. How many bowls of chicken food does he need to give his chickens their last meal if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	Wandi, kwa nini? (Why not?) Ah, kwa nini? (Ah, why not?) Okay, okay, let's calculate! Wendi gives 15 bowls in the morning, then 25 in the afternoon, that's 15 + 25 = 40 bowls. If he gives 3 bowls to each chicken, and he has 20 chickens, he needs 20 x 3 = 60 bowls. But he already gave 40, so he needs 60 - 40 = 20 bowls for the last meal. Wandi, nini? (What is it?) Ah, Wendi needs 20 bowls for the last meal!

8	John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph and then turned around because he realized that he had forgotten something important about home. He tried to get home at 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours waiting and getting close. He then spent the next half hour driving at 30 mph, only to find that he drove the rest of the 4 hours at 80 mph. How far was he from home at the end of the 4 hours?	45	"Kulani, John yina amalungelo yethu! (Listen, John drove for us!) 

First, he drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, which means he covered a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

Then, he turned around and drove for 2 hours, waiting and getting close. This means he didn't cover any distance during this time.

After that, he drove at 30 mph for half an hour, which is 0.5 hours. This means he covered a distance of 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drove at 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. This means he covered a distance of 2 x 80 = 160 miles.

In total, John drove a distance of 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles."

The number of subscribers in the second month is three times higher than the number of subscribers in the first month, but it also decreases by 30% in the third month. How many subscribers does the program have in total over the three months?	366	Mfana, ngikwazi ukuthi lapho startup yethu ithola izinsiza ngomhlaka wokuqala 60. Ngomhlaka wokuqala, izinsiza zithola izinsiza ezithathu ngomhlaka wokuqala, kodwa zithola ukuthi izinsiza zizimele ngomhlaka wokuqala ngokuthuthukisa 30%. Ukuthi ngomhlaka wokuqala, izinsiza zithola 60, ngomhlaka wokuqala, izinsiza zithola 60 x 3 = 180, ngomhlaka wokuqala, izinsiza zithola 180 - 30% = 126. Ukuthi ngomhlaka wokuqala, izinsiza zithola 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of chickens. She bought 3 dozen chickens for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen pancakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen pancakes for $55 a dozen.	694	"Sawubona! Khuluma ngani? (Hello! What's the question?)

12	Carlos grows mango trees. The tree will cost him $90 to plant. Each year he will grow 7 mango trees, which he can sell for $1.5 each. He spends about $3 a year watering and feeding the trees. How many years will it take before he starts making money on the mango tree?	13	"Ndi kwa ngwaa! (That's a tough one!) 

Carlos will spend $90 to plant the tree, and then $3 per year to maintain it. So, the total cost per year is $93. He will grow 7 mango trees, which he can sell for $1.5 each, so he will earn $10.5 per year.

To break even, Carlos needs to earn $90 to cover the initial cost of planting the tree. Since he earns $10.5 per year, it will take him:

$90 ÷ $10.5 = 8.57 years

to break even and start making money on the mango tree.

Ndi kwa ngwaa! (That's the answer!)"

Marisa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. She needs to walk 6 more miles to reach her goal. Since she wants to walk 4 miles per hour, she will need 1.5 hours to walk the remaining 6 miles.
20	I have 10 gallons of pineapple juice which is two thirds water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But as I pour it, I leave one gallon of pineapple juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 gallons?	15	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's calculate the amount of water in the initial 10 gallons of pineapple juice:

2/3 × 10 = 6.67 gallons of water

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 gallons of pineapple juice:

3/5 × 15 = 9 gallons of water

You pour the 10 gallons of pineapple juice into the 15 gallons, leaving 1 gallon behind. So, the total amount of pineapple juice is:

10 + 15 - 1 = 24 gallons

The amount of water in the remaining 24 gallons is the sum of the initial water and the water from the 15 gallons:

6.67 + 9 = 15.67 gallons of water

Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)"

After burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, it will burn for 4 hours. Since it burns at 2 centimeters per square inch per hour, it will burn a total of:

2 cm²/in²/hour x 4 hours = 8 cm²/in²

So, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, it will be 8 centimeters per square inch!"
24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is a 25% discount over the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Ndi ndi! (That's easy!) 

Let's call the original price ""x"". Since it's a 25% discount, the discount amount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.75x = 19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
25	Marie asked for a fried chicken for $12, a 5-milk carton for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and a box of pizzas. Marie paid a total of $50. How many pizzas did Marie ask for if the cost was $8.50 each?	2	Mama, Marie alikwazi 2 pizzas.

28	Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile motorcycle trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he walk between his first and second stops?	25	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a good question!)

Henry stopped after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find the distance between his first and second stops, we need to find the distance from his first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract 15.

The distance from his first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

So, the distance between his first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

Wena ukuthula! (That's the answer!)"
29	Gloria was shopping for shoes when she came across a pair of taco boots that fit her pocket. But she had to choose between the taco boots and two high-heeled shoes that cost a total of $5 less than the taco boots.

31	Gunter is trying to count the beans in a bottle. He asks his friends how much they think will be in the bottle. One says 80. Another says it's 20 more than half of the original. A third says it's 25% more than the original. What is their estimate?	80	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! - in Zulu)

Answer: 

* Friend 1: 80
* Friend 2: If x is the original number of beans, then 20 + (1/2)x. To find x, subtract 20 from their answer: x = 60.
* Friend 3: 25% more than the original means 1.25x. Since they didn't give an exact answer, we can't find the original number. But we can find their estimate: 1.25x.

So, their estimates are 80, 60, and 1.25x."
32	John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog spends 5 hours a day walking and doing their activities. How many hours a week does he spend caring for the dogs?	35	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let me calculate!)

Each dog spends 5 hours a day, so for 10 dogs, it's 10 x 5 = 50 hours per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, John spends 50 x 7 = 350 hours per week caring for the dogs!"

Raymond has 40 gems. Aaron has 5 more gems than half of Raymond's gems, so Aaron has (40/2) + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 gems.

Siobhan has 2 fewer gems than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 gems.

Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)"
35	Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. How many points did he score in total?	9	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which gives us 1. So Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes. In total, he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points. Ngiyabonga!
36	Terry used to eat 2 yoghurts a day. They are now selling 4 yoghurts for $5.00. How much does yogurt cost in 30 days?	75	"Ngiyakuthandaza! (I'm happy to help!)

38	John ran 60 miles a week. He ran 3 days a week. He ran for 3 and a half hours on the first day than the other two days. How fast was he running?	10	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili)

John ran 60 miles in 3 days. To find out how many miles he ran per day, we can divide 60 by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20 miles per day

Since he ran for 3 and a half hours on the first day, and 3 hours on the other two days, we can find out how many miles he ran per hour:

First day: 3.5 hours × 20 miles per day = 70 miles
Other two days: 3 hours × 20 miles per day = 60 miles
Total: 70 + 60 + 60 = 190 miles

Now, let's find out how many hours he ran in total:

First day: 3.5 hours
Other two days: 2 × 3 hours = 6 hours
Total: 3.5 + 6 = 9.5 hours

To find out how fast he was running, we can divide the total distance by the total time:

190 miles ÷ 9.5 hours = approximately 20 miles per hour"
39	Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?	18	"Moo nkhono! (I'll answer!)

Dana can walk at a speed of x miles per hour. Since she can run at twice that speed, she can run at 2x miles per hour. Since she can jump at half that speed, she can jump at x miles per hour. Since she can fly at 3 miles per hour, we can set up the equation:

2x + x + x/2 = 6

Combine like terms:

5.5x = 6

Divide by 5.5:

x = 1.09 miles per hour

So Dana can walk at approximately 1.09 miles per hour. In six hours, she can walk:

6 x 1.09 = 6.54 miles

Moo nkhono! (That's the answer!)"

43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips contains 250 calories in one serving. If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Ko si kekere! (That's a tough one!)

Let's calculate the total calories in the bag of chips: 250 calories per serving × 5 servings = 1250 calories.

You want to know how many grams you would eat to reach your daily goal of 2000 calories, having already eaten 1800 calories. To reach 2000 calories, you need to eat an additional 200 calories.

The amount of calories per gram is 250 calories / 300g = 0.83 calories per gram.

To find out how many grams you would eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram: 200 calories ÷ 0.83 calories per gram = 241.46 grams.

So, you would eat approximately 241 grams of the bag of chips."

After the additional cost, what was the final price of Stephen's purchase?	57	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

To calculate the final price, first, let's calculate the additional cost:

25% of $40.00 = 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00
Total additional cost = $10.00 + $3.00 (shipping) = $13.00
Total cost after additional cost = $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00
Final cost with food = $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

76	Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. As her pet sitter, she has to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food a day for the first 180 days. Then she has to give the puppy 2 cups of dog food a day for the rest of her life. If a dog food bag has 110 cups, how many dog food bags will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Ndi mawu! (That's okay!) Let me calculate that for you.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will use 180 cups of dog food. Since each bag has 110 cups, she will use:

180 cups / 110 cups per bag = 1.6363 bags (round up to 2 bags)

For the rest of her life, Cecilia will give the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. In a year, there are approximately 365 days, so she will use:

2 cups/day × 365 days = 730 cups

Since each bag has 110 cups, she will use:

730 cups / 110 cups per bag = 6.6363 bags (round up to 7 bags)

In total, Cecilia will use:

2 bags (for the first 180 days) + 7 bags (for the rest of her life) = 9 bags

Ndi mawu! (That's okay!) Cecilia will use 9 dog food bags in the first year."

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200.

Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100.

The difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100.

87	A company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salary of each of its employees by 10% of the first salary per year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years in the company last October, what is her salary per year after spending three more years on the job?	9360	"Ngiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

First, let's calculate Sylvie's salary after the 10% increase:

$600 x 0.10 = $60
$600 + $60 = $660

So, Sylvie's salary is $660 per month after the 10% increase.

Now, let's calculate her salary after three more years:

$660 x 12 = $7,920 (annual salary)
$7,920 x 1.10 (10% increase) = $8,688 (new annual salary)

After three more years, Sylvie's salary will be $8,688 per year."
88	Marilyn's first album sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If 88,000 copies were sold in total, how many copies did Harald sell?	8000	"Wena ukuthula! (What's the problem?)

Marilyn's album sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's call the number of copies Harald sold ""x"". Then, Marilyn's album sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000. We can set up an equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies. Wena ukuthula, ngicela ukuthula! (What's the answer, I want to answer!)"

I calculate that in the first 15 minutes, 5 cars left and 20 cars entered. That means there were 5 - 20 = -15 cars. But we know there are 30 cars on the road. So, we add 30 + 15 = 45 cars. To find the number of cars that entered in the first 15 minutes, we subtract 20 from 45, which is 25 cars. 

25 cars entered in the first 15 minutes. Ngiyabonga!"

107	Frankie watches TV in the evening after doing his homework. He watches his favorite one-hour show on business and victory days. On Sundays he watches a half-hour show. On Wednesdays, he finishes his homework early to watch a one-and-a-half-hour game. On Fridays he sleeps late because it's a weekend, so he watches a two-hour game. If he watches TV for 7 hours straight, how many half-hour games does he watch a day?	3	"Sawubona! Ngicela ukuthula! (Hello! Let's relax!) 

Frankie watches TV for 7 hours straight. He watches a one-hour show on business and victory days, a half-hour show on Sundays, a one-and-a-half-hour game on Wednesdays, and a two-hour game on Fridays. 

Let's calculate the total hours he watches TV: 
1 hour (business) + 0.5 hours (Sunday) + 1.5 hours (Wednesday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5 hours 

He still has 2 hours left to watch TV. Since he watches TV for 7 hours straight, he must watch another 2 hours of TV. 

Frankie watches a half-hour show on Sundays, so he watches 0.5 hours of TV. To find out how many half-hour shows he watches a day, we subtract the total hours he watches from 7 hours: 
7 hours - 5 hours = 2 hours 

Since each half-hour show is 0.5 hours, we divide the remaining hours by 0.5 hours: 
2 hours ÷ 0.5 hours = 4 half-hour shows 

Sawubona! Frankie watches 4 half-hour shows a day. (Hello! Frankie watches 4 half-hour shows a day.)"
108	Henry is making cookies for a home competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. At the end of the party he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than he wanted to. He dropped 5 while waiting for it to cool, now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?	50	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!) Okay, let's solve this problem together. Let's call the number of cookies Henry made last year ""x"". Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he wants to make 2x cookies this year.

Since he dropped 5 cookies, he actually made 2x + 5 cookies. And at the end of the party, he found he had 15 more cookies than he wanted to, so he actually made 2x + 5 + 15 = 2x + 20 cookies.

We know he has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 20 = 110

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 45

So Henry made 45 cookies last year! Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!)"

110	Marcell and Beatrice were competing to see who could eat the most fruit rolls, they released as many as they could find. But someone made a mistake which made Beatrice's roll up 3 inches and 24 inches long while Marcell's roll up 3 inches and 14 inches long. If they both ate all the rolls they were given, how many did they eat in half?	45	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Marcell ate 3 + 14 = 17 inches and Beatrice ate 3 + 24 = 27 inches. Since they ate all the rolls, they ate half of the total rolls. To find the total rolls, we add the inches they ate: 17 + 27 = 44 inches. To find half, we divide by 2: 44 ÷ 2 = 22 rolls.

If Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures, how many birds can we see in Jamal's bird in the zoo?	6	Nǐn hàn, kuku! (Ah, friend, listen!) If Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures, and it takes 6 times more pictures than Brittany's telescope, then Brittany's telescope can take 1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures. Since Brittany's telescope can take 50 times more pictures than Jamal's bird in the zoo, Jamal's bird in the zoo can take 300 ÷ 50 = 6 pictures.

119	Adrien's total salary is 30 percent more than Lylah's. After four years, her salary is the same and she is earning 40% more than she was earning four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries are the same and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate their total salary after four years?	95200	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Lylah's salary after four years = 1.4 x (Lylah's salary four years ago)

Adrien's salary after four years = 1.4 x (Adrien's salary four years ago) + 40,000

Since Adrien's salary after four years is the same as Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

1.4 x (Adrien's salary four years ago) + 40,000 = 1.4 x (Lylah's salary four years ago)

Since Adrien's salary four years ago is 30% more than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's salary four years ago = 1.3 x Lylah's salary four years ago

Substitute this into the first equation:

1.4 x (1.3 x Lylah's salary four years ago) + 40,000 = 1.4 x (Lylah's salary four years ago)

Simplify and solve for Lylah's salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years ago = 60,000

Now we can find Adrien's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary four years ago = 1.3 x 60,000 = 78,000

So, Lylah's salary after four years is:

1.4 x 60,000 = 84,000

And Adrien's salary after four years is:

1.4 x 78,000 + 40,000 = 134,000

Total salary after four years = Lylah's salary after four years + Adrien's salary after four years = 84,000 + 134,000 = 218,000

122	Sadie slept for 8 hours on Fridays. For about two days, she slept less than 2 hours each, because she had to finish her homework each time. If she slept an hour more than she slept on two days, how many hours did she sleep in total this whole week?	48	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sadie slept 8 hours on Fridays.

For two days, she slept less than 2 hours each, so let's assume she slept 1 hour each day. That's a total of 2 hours for those two days.

If she slept an hour more on the other days, that means she slept 3 hours each day (2 hours + 1 hour).

So, the total hours she slept this week are:

8 hours (Fridays) + 2 hours (two days) + 3 hours (two days) = 13 hours

129	A hospital sees 500 people a day. The average time it takes to respond to a patient is 24 hours. Doctors make $150 an hour from the hospital, and the hospital makes $200 an hour from the patients. How much money does the hospital make from scans?	10000	"Wahala! (That's a problem!)

Let's break it down:

500 patients per day
Average response time: 24 hours
Doctors make $150/hour
Hospital makes $200/hour

First, let's calculate the total hours spent responding to patients:
500 patients/day × 24 hours/patient = 12,000 hours/day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the hospital makes from doctors' services:
12,000 hours/day × $150/hour = $1,800,000/day

The hospital makes $200/hour from patients. Since they spend 12,000 hours responding to patients, they make:
12,000 hours/day × $200/hour = $2,400,000/day

Adding the two amounts, the hospital makes:
$1,800,000/day + $2,400,000/day = $4,200,000/day

Now, let's subtract the amount the hospital makes from doctors' services from the total amount:
$4,200,000/day - $1,800,000/day = $2,400,000/day

This is the amount the hospital makes from scans."

Let's calculate the number of elves that were shot: 10% + 9% = 19% of the elves were shot. 19% of 60 is 0.19 x 60 = 11.4. Since you can't have a fraction of an elf, we'll round down to 11 elves that were shot.

To find the number of elves left, subtract the number of elves shot from the total: 60 - 11 = 49 elves left.

141	There are 700 eggs in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, and twice as many hives as there are queens. How many workers are there?	400	"Moo nala! (That's one way to say ""Answer"" in Yoruba, a Nigerian language.)

There are 700 eggs in the hive. Since there are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, and twice as many hives as there are queens, we can set up an equation:

700 eggs = 2x hives, where x is the number of queens.

Since there are twice as many hives as there are queens, we can write:

2x hives = x queens

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

700 eggs = 2x (x queens)

Simplifying, we get:

700 = 2x^2

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

350 = x^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

x = √350 ≈ 18.75

Since there can't be a fraction of a queen, we round down to 18 queens.

Now, since there are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, we can multiply the number of hives by 2:

2x hives = 2(18) hives = 36 hives

Since there are 700 eggs, and each hive has 700/36 ≈ 19.44 eggs (again, we round down to 19 eggs per hive), we can multiply the number of hives by 19 eggs per hive:

36 hives × 19 eggs/hive = 684 eggs

Subtracting the number of eggs from the total, we get:

700 - 684 = 16 eggs

These 16 eggs must belong to the worker bees. Since each worker bee lays about 60 eggs per day, we can divide the number of eggs by 60:

16 eggs ÷ 60 ≈ 0.267

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:

1 worker bee

Since there are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, we multiply the number of worker bees by 2:

2 worker bees

So, there are approximately 2 worker bees."

John buys milk for R2, eggs for R3, lights for R3, cups for R3, and roach traps for R4. Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, the total cost is:

R2 (milk) + R3 (eggs) = R5 (food items)
R3 (lights) + R3 (cups) + R4 (roach traps) = R10 (non-food items)
R10 (non-food items) x 0.10 = R1 (tax)
R10 + R1 = R11 (total non-food items)

So, the total point of everything John buys is R5 (food items) + R11 (non-food items) = R16."

155	Bill cooks 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes a day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to compare the lengths of the products he cooks to each other, how long would they be in feet?	280	"Moo ngwana, ngwana! (That's a good question, my friend!)

Let's convert the lengths to feet:

* Rolls: 4 inches = 1/3 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
* Croissants: 6 inches = 1/2 feet
* Baguettes: 2 feet (already in feet)

So, the lengths in feet would be: 1/3 feet (rolls), 1/2 feet (croissants), and 2 feet (baguettes)."

(Translation: I'll calculate, I'll calculate, I'll calculate, I'll calculate!)

Let's break it down:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is eight years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is also eight years old. From point 2, we know Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 16 years old. From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 19 years old.

Now, let's find the average age:

(8 + 8 + 16 + 19) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

Ndi a ku ngwena, ndi a ku ngwena, ndi a ku ngwena, ndi a ku ngwena! (Translation: I've calculated, I've calculated, I've calculated, I've calculated!) The average age of the four birds is 12.75 years old."

Ndipo Jessica ndi ku kopa $350 + $300 + $750 = $1400 ku kopa kwa month. Ndipo Jessica ndi ku kopa $1400 ku kopa kwa month, ndipo Jessica ndi ku kopa $1400 x 12 = $16,800 ku kopa kwa year.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they sell it for $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar. They sell each bottle for $0.50, and they get 20 bottles for a gallon. If they get $25 in profit, how much do they spend on lemonade?	15	"Wahala! Ndiyakha ukwazi. (I'll try to help you understand.)

Let's break it down:

* They sell each gallon for $3 (lemon) + $2 (sugar) = $5.
* They get 20 bottles for a gallon, and each bottle is $0.50, so the total for a gallon of bottles is 20 x $0.50 = $10.
* Total profit is $25, so total revenue is $25 + $5 (gallon) = $30.
* Since they get $30 in revenue, and they spend $5 on each gallon, they must have sold x gallons, where x * $5 = $30.
* So, x = 6 gallons.
* 6 gallons * $5 per gallon = $30 spent on lemonade.

Answer: Ndiyakha, Juan and Carlos spent $30 on lemonade. (I hope that helps!)"

198	Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she received three times that amount. In the second month, she received 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, she received twice the total number of Pokemon cards she received in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Wena ke na? (What's the question?)

Ah, I see! Let me calculate...

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

After the first month, she received three times that amount, which is 3 x 20 = 60. So, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she received 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40. So, she now has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she received twice the total number of Pokémon cards she received in the first and second months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200. So, she now has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Wena ke na? (What's the answer?)

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards in total!"
199	Mark is a copy-editor. He edits the same amount of sentences for two different editors, who pay him a different amount per sentence. Copywriter B pays twice what Copywriter A paid Mark. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences for him, and A pays him 5 cents per sentence. What does Mark get for a penny, per cent?	7500	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Mark receives 5 cents per sentence from Copywriter A, and Copywriter B pays twice that amount, which is 10 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for both copywriters, he receives a total of 5 cents x 1000 sentences = $50 from Copywriter A and 10 cents x 1000 sentences = $100 from Copywriter B. Therefore, Mark receives a total of $50 + $100 = $150.

To find out how much Mark receives per cent, we need to divide the total amount he receives by 100. $150 ÷ 100 = $1.50 per cent.

So, Mark receives 1.5 cents per cent."

Rose bought 4 loaves of bread on Good Friday. On Victory Day, she bought 3 times as many, which is 4 x 3 = 12 loaves. On Labor Day, she bought 5 times as many as on Victory Day, which is 12 x 5 = 60 loaves. In total, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 loaves of bread. Ndi aah! (That's the answer!)
209	Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than six cans sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the price of each cup	145	"Ndiyo! (Yes!) 

Let's solve the problem:

6 cans sold for $6,000 each, so the total amount is:
6 x $6,000 = $36,000

Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than this amount, so the amount is:
$36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

Since there are 12 cups, the price of each cup is:
$34,800 ÷ 12 = $2,900 per cup

So, the price of each cup is $2,900."
210	Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket is about $30, and the shoes are $20 each. Sara cleans the neighborhood four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cleans the field. If Sara had already saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many times did she have to clear the field to buy the jacket and shoes?	10	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let's calculate!)

Sara wants to buy a jacket ($30) and shoes ($20 x 2 = $40). Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70.

She already has $10 saved. She earns $5 for cleaning the neighborhood and $4 for cleaning the field. To find out how much she needs to earn, subtract what she already has from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.

She earns $5 for cleaning the neighborhood, so she needs to clean the neighborhood 12 times to earn the remaining $60: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

However, she needs to earn money for cleaning the field too. Let's assume she cleans the field x times. Each time, she earns $4, so the total amount she earns from cleaning the field is 4x. We know she needs to earn $60 more, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 60.

To solve for x, divide both sides by 4: x = 60 ÷ 4 = 15.

So, Sara needs to clean the field 15 times to earn the remaining $60. In total, she needs to clean the field 15 times and the neighborhood 12 times to buy the jacket and shoes."
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's call the number of red chickens ""x"".

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x.

The white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is less than 5(x + 2).

The total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) < 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 < 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x < 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x < 4

Since x is the number of red chickens, x must be an integer. The greatest integer less than 4 is 3.

So, Jerry has 3 red chickens."
212	Gary likes to walk around the edge of a surrounding park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 to 6 miles. If he walks 3 hours an hour, how many hours does he walk in total?	5	"Moo nkhono! (That's a math problem!) 

Let's calculate the perimeter of the park: 2(1.5 + 6) = 14 miles. Since Gary walks 3 miles per hour, he will walk 14 miles / 3 miles per hour = 4.67 hours.

Moo nkhono! (That's the answer!)"

Let's break it down:

Mike has 3 friends left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week with 5 pages each. That's 3 friends x 2 letters x 5 pages = 30 pages per week.

Mike responds well, so he writes 30 pages per week.

He can write 1 page in 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, he'll take:

30 pages x 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours

Mike spends 3 hours writing a book a week. Hamba kahle!"
