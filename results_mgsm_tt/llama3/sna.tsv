Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 for breakfast, uses 4 for muffins, leaving 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. She sells 9 eggs for $2 each, so she makes 9 x 2 = 18 dollars a day at the farmers' market."

7	Carla is downloading a 200GB file. She usually downloads 2GB/minute, but 40% of the time in between downloads, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla restarts the download from the beginning. How long will it take to download the file?	160	"Kwaku! (That's ""Ahah!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language)

Carla's download speed is 2GB/minute. So, to download 200GB, it will take:

200GB / 2GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the time, which is 0.4 * 100 = 40 minutes. This means Carla restarts the download 40 times.

Each restart takes 20 minutes, so the total time spent on restarts is:

40 minutes * 20 minutes = 800 minutes

Adding this to the initial download time, Carla will spend:

100 minutes + 800 minutes = 900 minutes

to download the 200GB file.

Kwaku! (That's ""Ahah!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language)"
8	John drives for 3 hours at 60mph and returns home after remembering that he forgot something at home. He tries to get home by 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop. He then spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, before he can drive the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. How far would he be from home by the end of 4 hours?	45	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba ungangithola isimo esinikele. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking such a clever question.)

John drives for 3 hours at 60mph, which means he covers a distance of:

3 hours x 60 mph = 180 miles

Then, he returns home, but spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop. This means he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Next, he spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, which is 0.5 hours. He covers a distance of:

0.5 hours x 30 mph = 15 miles

Finally, he drives the remaining 4 hours at 80mph, which means he covers a distance of:

4 hours x 80 mph = 320 miles

Adding up all the distances, John would be:

180 miles (outward journey) + 15 miles (waiting) + 320 miles (return journey) = 515 miles

from home by the end of 4 hours. Ngiyabonga ukuba ungangithola isimo esinikele! (Thank you for asking such a clever question!)"
9	Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?	460	Ndi nyalala! Eliza earni 10 dollar an hour for 40 hour, that's 400 dollar.

14	In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?	60	Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) 20% of 20 kids are learning modern dance, which is 4 kids. The rest, 16 kids, are learning either jazz or hip-hop. 25% of 16 kids are learning jazz, which is 4 kids. The remaining 12 kids are learning hip-hop. To find the percentage, divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. 12/20 = 0.6, and 0.6 x 100 = 60%. Ndiyo, 60% of the kids are hip-hop dancers!
15	A salesman has to choose between two sales: Jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to rise 2.5% and the electronics market to rise 1.2% in the same month. If the salesman expects a high profit at the end of the month, what profit would he make?	125	Wena ke rena, o tla kgona ka mokgwa wa jewelry e tla kgona ka $5,000. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka $8,000. O financial advisor o tla kgona ka mokgwa wa jewelry e tla kgona ka 2.5% e tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka 1.2%. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa jewelry e tla kgona ka $5,000 x 2.5% = $125. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka $8,000 x 1.2% = $96. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa jewelry e tla kgona ka $5,000 + $125 = $5,125. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka $8,000 + $96 = $8,096. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka $8,096 - $5,125 = $2,971. O tla kgona ka mokgwa wa electronics e tla kgona ka $2,971.

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?	57500	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, she would make:

Teacher: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year * $X/hour = $X * 1750 hours/year

Cheerleader: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year * $Y/hour = $Y * 750 hours/year

Total hours/year: 1750 hours/year + 750 hours/year = 2500 hours/year

Total pay/year: $X * 1750 hours/year + $Y * 750 hours/year = $X * 1750 + $Y * 750

24	Kyle bought the best-selling book of the year for $19.50. This includes a 25% commission on the sales price. What was the actual price of the book?	26	"Ndi ndi! (That's easy!) 

Let's calculate the actual price of the book:

Sales price = $19.50
Commission = 25% of $19.50 = $4.88 (since 25% of 100 is 25, and 25% of 19.50 is 4.88)
Actual price = Sales price - Commission = $19.50 - $4.88 = $14.62

So, the actual price of the book is $14.62."

28	Henry stopped twice on a 60-mile motorcycle trip. He stopped first after 20 miles, then stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first stop and his last stop?	25	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Henry stopped first after 20 miles, and then stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

So, he traveled from 20 miles to 45 miles, which is 25 miles."
29	Gloria is looking for shoes to buy when she comes across a pair that fits her shoe budget. But, she has to choose between buying a pair of shoes or a pair of shoes that cost $5 less than the cost of a pair of shoes. If a pair of shoes costs $33, the shoes cost twice as much, how much do the shoes cost to buy?	104	"Mfana, ngicela ukuthola isimo esikhethini! (My friend, let's find the answer!) 

If a pair of shoes costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, then the other pair costs $33 x 2 = $66. 

But, the second pair costs $5 less than the first pair, so we subtract $5 from $66: $66 - $5 = $61. 

So, the second pair of shoes costs $61."
30	Darrel and Allen have the same age divided by 7:11. If their combined age is 162 years, how old would Allen be today?	109	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili)

Let's break it down: If their combined age is 162 years, and their ages are the same when divided by 7:11, we can set up an equation:

x + x = 162

Combine like terms:

2x = 162

Divide by 2:

x = 81

Now, since their ages are the same when divided by 7:11, we can set up another equation:

x/7.11 = x/7.11

Since they have the same age, we can set x equal to Allen's age:

Allen's age = 81

So, Allen would be 81 years old today!"
31	Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in his can. He asks his friends how many they think there are. One says there are 80. Another says there are 20 more than the average of the first one. The third says 25% more than the first one. What is the average of their prediction?	80	"Mfana, ngiyabonga! (Young man, thank you!)

To find the average, we need to add up all the predictions and divide by the number of predictions.

Prediction 1: 80
Prediction 2: 20 more than the average of the first one = 80 + 20 = 100
Prediction 3: 25% more than the first one = 80 + (25/100) * 80 = 80 + 20 = 100

Total predictions: 80 + 100 + 100 = 280
Number of predictions: 3

Average: 280 / 3 = 93.33

Mfana, ngiyabonga! (Young man, thank you!)"

37	John is considering selling his toys and using the money to buy video games. He makes 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and is left with $5. How many Lego sets does he have left?	2	Sabi! John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, that's a total of $195. He used $160 to buy 8 video games, and had $5 left. So, he has 13 - (195 - 160) = 13 - 35 = 8 Lego sets left.
38	John runs 60 miles a week, three days a week, for three hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days.	10	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)

39	Dana can run twice as fast as she can walk but jumps the rope at a moderate speed. If she jumps 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she walk in six hours if she walks one third of the time she runs and two thirds of the time she walks?	18	"Nǐ yòu yī jiǔ! (You're doing well!)

Since Dana jumps rope at a moderate speed, we can assume it's around 3 miles per hour. Since she walks one third of the time she runs, and runs twice as fast as she walks, she must run at 6 miles per hour. Since she walks for 2 hours out of the 6 hours, she walks for a total of 2 hours at 1 mile per hour, which is 2 miles."
40	Brandon's iPhone is twice the size of Ben's. Ben's iPhone is twice the size of Suzy's. If Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, how old is Brandon?	8	Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) Brandon's iPhone is twice the size of Ben's, and Ben's iPhone is twice the size of Suzy's. This means Brandon's iPhone is four times the size of Suzy's. Since Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, we can set up an equation: Brandon's age = Suzy's age - 1. But we also know that Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, so Suzy's age = Brandon's age + 1. Substituting this into the first equation, we get Brandon's age = (Brandon's age + 1) - 1. Simplifying, we get Brandon's age = Brandon's age. This is a tautology, so we can't determine Brandon's age from this information.
41	The legendary dragon, Perg, sits atop the summit of Mount Farbo, breathing fire from nearly 1,000 feet away. Polly can throw a Javelin javelin, a golden spear that can pierce the Dragon 400 feet away near the Dragon's flames. But with a sapphire gemstone in her hand, Polly can throw a javelin spear three times brighter than without a gemstone. If she holds a gemstone, how can Polly stand so far away from the Dragon's fire while she can throw a javelin javelin?	200	Nǐ! (Ahah! In Yoruba) Polly yóò gbé ènìyàn, ó wà lórí àjìkó, ó gbé ẹ̀nìyàn àti ẹ̀nìyàn, ó wà lórí àjìkó. (Polly will throw the javelin, she will stand far away, she will throw the javelin and stand far away.)
42	Mrs. Jones cooked five slices of apple pie for the fireman's lunch. She sliced each pie into eight slices and set five slices on the dining table for the guests to help themselves to a meal. At the end of her slices in the evening, there were 14 slices left over. How many slices did the guests eat?	26	Sabi sabi, ngwana! (I understand, young one!) Mrs. Jones had 5 slices of apple pie initially. She sliced each pie into 8 slices, making a total of 5 x 8 = 40 slices. She set 5 slices aside, leaving 40 - 5 = 35 slices for the guests. At the end, there were 14 slices left over. Therefore, the guests ate 35 - 14 = 21 slices.
43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300-g bag has 5 servings, how many grams would you consume if you expect to eat 2,000 calories a day but have already eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

To find the number of grams you would consume, we need to calculate the total number of servings you can eat while staying within your daily calorie goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of calories in the bag:

250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1,250 calories

You want to eat 2,000 calories a day, but you've already eaten 1,800 calories, so you have 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat:

200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat:

0.8 servings x 300 g / 5 servings = 48 g

So, you would consume 48 grams of chips."

45	Meredith is a freelance journalist who writes about the topic of public health issues and then presents to clients every day as her life's work. The article takes 4 hours to research and write. Last week she wrote 5 articles on Monday with 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Find out how many hours she spent writing articles over three days.	104	"Ndiyakuthanda ukuba ngicela! (I love to help!) Okay, let's break it down:

Monday: 5 articles
Tuesday: 2/5 times more than Monday, so 5 + (5 x 2/5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles
Wednesday: Twice as many as Tuesday, so 7 x 2 = 14 articles

Total articles written: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

Each article takes 4 hours to write, so total hours spent writing: 26 x 4 = 104 hours

He dropped 5 cookies, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies initially.
He thought he would have fewer cookies, so he had 15 more than expected. Let's call the expected number of cookies ""x"". Then, 115 = x + 15.
Subtract 15 from both sides: 100 = x.
So, Henry baked 100 cookies last year."

111	Julia's boat sank at sea. The boat took two liters of water for every ten feet it sailed back to shore. It took her 16 seconds to sail twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds to reach. How much water did the boat take before Julia reached the shore?	16	"O le ke leboga, ke tla reng lebitso la Julia! (Don't worry, I'll help you with Julia's problem!)

To find out how much water the boat took, we need to find out how many liters it took to sail the entire distance. Since it took 2 liters of water for every 10 feet sailed, we can set up a proportion:

2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 64 feet

We know it took 16 seconds to sail 20 feet, so we can set up another proportion:

20 feet / 16 seconds = x feet / 64 seconds

Now we can solve for x:

Rory's total bill is:
2 soaps = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Total bill with delivery surcharge = $20.00 + $5.80 = $25.80
Handbag = $5.00
Total cost to deliver the items = $25.80 + $5.00 = $30.80

153	Dave buys a large bag of French fries and eats fourteen before being snatched away by a hungry seagull. Upon landing, the seagull eats half as many as Dave has eaten. Three cockroaches also come and chase him from his diet, each cockroach eating three potatoes. Later, a raccoon steals one-third of the remaining potatoes. Ants carry one remaining potato, leaving five. How many French fries were in the bag that Dave bought?	48	"Ngiyakuthandaza ukuba kubalulele! (I'm happy to help you!)

Let's break it down:

Dave eats 14 French fries.
The seagull eats half of what Dave has eaten, which is 14/2 = 7 French fries.
So, there are 14 + 7 = 21 French fries left.
The three cockroaches eat 3 potatoes each, but we don't know how many potatoes are in a bag of French fries, so we'll assume they eat 3 French fries each. That's 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
Now, there are 21 - 9 = 12 French fries left.
A raccoon steals one-third of the remaining French fries, which is 12/3 = 4 French fries.
So, there are 12 - 4 = 8 French fries left.
Ants carry one French fry away, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 French fries.
Finally, we're left with 5 French fries, which means the ants must have carried away 7 - 5 = 2 French fries.

Let's add up the French fries that have been eaten or carried away: 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (cockroaches) + 4 (raccoon) + 2 (ants) = 36 French fries.

So, there were 36 French fries in the bag that Dave bought!"

166	Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of nine eggs each when she stays with her daughter. To make Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra was asked to cook 15 Spanish flan to collect school fees, how many days would she have to take care of the child?	5	"Kojo! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

Sandra needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan, and she needs to make 15 Spanish flan. So, she needs 3 x 15 = 45 eggs.

She has 9 eggs initially, and each day she gets 9 more eggs. To find out how many days she needs to take care of the child, we can divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs she gets each day (9).

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra would need to take care of the child for 5 days to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flan."

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each jar of lemonade they make, they spend $3 on lemonade and $2 on sugar. They sell a glass for $0.50 for 20 glasses per jar. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemonade?	15	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) Okay, let's solve the problem. 

First, let's find out how much they spent on lemonade and sugar in total. They spend $3 on lemonade and $2 on sugar, so that's $5 per jar. Since they make 20 glasses per jar, they make 20 jars in total. So, they spend $5 x 20 = $100 on lemonade and sugar.

Next, let's find out how much they earned. They sell each glass for $0.50, so they earn $0.50 x 20 = $10 per jar. Since they make 20 jars, they earn $10 x 20 = $200.

Now, let's find out their profit. They earned $200 and spent $100, so their profit is $200 - $100 = $100.

But wait, the problem says they made a profit of $25, not $100! So, let's go back and see where we went wrong. Ah, I see! We forgot to subtract the cost of lemonade and sugar from the earnings! So, let's do that. They earned $200, but they spent $5 per jar, so they actually earned $200 - ($5 x 20) = $200 - $100 = $100. But we know they made a profit of $25, so let's subtract that from their earnings. $100 - $25 = $75.

Now, let's find out how much they spent on lemonade. They spent $5 per jar, and they made 20 jars, so they spent $5 x 20 = $100 on lemonade and sugar. But we know they actually spent less than that, since their profit was $25. So, let's subtract their profit from the amount they spent. $100 - $25 = $75.

And there you have it! Juan and his brother Carlos spent $75 on lemonade."

177	Zaid spends a quarter of his salary on rent, a third on gasoline, and a third on charity. He gives his son $200 for his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much is left after these expenses and donations?	350	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Zaid's salary is $6,000. He spends:

* 1/4 on rent = $1,500
* 1/3 on gasoline = $2,000
* 1/3 on charity = $2,000

Total expenses: $5,500

He gives his son $200 and his wife $700, so total donations: $900

Total expenses and donations: $6,400

Left over: $6,000 - $6,400 = -$400 (Zaid is in the red, sorry to say!)

188	A buyer buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry a sack from the field to the warehouse, this buyer made a profit of $400 by selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the profit:

Cost of wheat = $20 per sack
Cost of carrying a sack = $2 per sack
Total cost per sack = $20 + $2 = $22 per sack

Selling price per sack = $30 per sack
Profit per sack = $30 - $22 = $8 per sack

Total profit = $400
Number of sacks = Total profit / Profit per sack
= $400 / $8
= 50 sacks

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
189	Three friends spent $20.25 to buy 3 entrance tickets to the game. They also spent $4.50 less than they spent on all the tickets for food. They also went to 2 different equestrian events for $33 each. If they agreed to split all their expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Here's the answer:

Let's calculate the total cost of the entrance tickets: 3 tickets x $20.25 = $60.75

Let's calculate the cost of food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Total cost of food and tickets: $60.75 + $15.75 = $76.50

Total cost of equestrian events: 2 events x $33 = $66

Total expenses: $76.50 + $66 = $142.50

Split equally among 3 friends: $142.50 ÷ 3 = $47.50

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six exams in each quarter. They allow children to subtract the lowest-lowest-average scores in each quarter. If Brinley has scores of 89,71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five exams, what scores does he need to make on the sixth exam to get an average score of 93?	98	"Kwaku, Brinley nipa asɛm yi. Na ɛnnye na ɔbɛn yɛn? (What's the problem, Brinley? What's the question?) Ah, math class! Okay, let me calculate... 

To find the lowest score, we need to add the scores and find the average: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. Then, divide by 5: 438 ÷ 5 = 87.6. So, the lowest score is 87.

Now, to get an average score of 93, we need to find the average of the remaining scores: 93 × 6 = 558. Subtract the total of the lowest score: 558 - 87 = 471.

Now, divide the result by 6: 471 ÷ 6 = 78.5. So, Brinley needs to score at least 78.5 on the sixth exam to get an average score of 93."

212	If Gary walks three miles an hour, how many hours does it take him to walk around the edge of a box-shaped park?	5	Ndi kwa? (What's the question?) Ah, Gary walks three miles an hour. If the park is a box, we need to find the perimeter. Let's say the length and width of the box are 2 miles each. The perimeter is 2(2 + 2) = 8 miles. So, it will take Gary 8/3 hours to walk around the edge of the park. That's 2 hours and 40 minutes, ndi kwa!
213	At the dollar store, Sloane counts the customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than on the first day. if the total on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Ndi nyalani! (I understand!) 

Kwaku, na ndi ndi? (How many?) 

On the first day, Sloane counted x customers. On the second day, he counted x + 50 customers. On the third day, he counted 500 customers in total. 

x + (x + 50) + 500 = 1500 

Combine like terms: 

2x + 50 = 1500 

Subtract 50 from both sides: 

2x = 1450 

Divide both sides by 2: 

x = 725 

So, Sloane counted 725 customers on the first day. On the second day, he counted 725 + 50 = 775 customers. On the third day, he counted 500 customers. 

Ndi ndi: 725 + 775 + 500 = 2000. (The answer is 2000.)"

Let's break it down:

Calendar puts together 4 pieces per minute.
Mother puts together half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Total pieces put together per minute = 4 (calendar) + 2 (mother) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it takes to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces put together per minute (6):

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

It will take the calendar and his mother 1 hour to complete the puzzle!"

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were some milk. After 2 months, 30% was ripe, so Ashlyn took that. That means 70% was left.

Then, after 2 weeks, 3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe, so she harvested that. That means 1/4 of the remaining milk was left.

So, out of the original milk, 1/4 of 70% is left. That's 17.5%.

Kungani, ukuthi 100% - 30% = 70% abantu abalalela ngokuhlela kuDay A. (Ah, so, since 30% left on Day A, that means 70% remained.)

Ngokuhlela, 70% - 3/5 * 70% = 70% - 42% = 28% abantu abalalela ngokuhlela kuDay B. (So, since 3/5 of the remaining 70% left on Day B, that means 28% remained.)

Ngokuhlela, 28% abantu abalalela ngokuhlela kuDay C. (So, all the remaining 28% left on Day C.)

Igoli elithi, 28% abantu abalalela ngokuhlela kuDay C. (So, the answer is 28% of the children left on Day C.)"

244	Griffin had 24 shots, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin some of his shots, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 shots less than Kyle's total. If Griffin ended up with 27 shots, how many shots did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 shots initially.
Kyle took 5 shots, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 shots.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 shots, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 shots.
Ginger gave Griffin some shots, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 shots less than Kyle's total, which is 5 shots. So Colby gave Griffin 5 - 3 = 2 shots.
Griffin ended up with 27 shots, so we need to find out how many shots Ginger gave him to make up the difference: 27 - 9 - 2 = 16 shots.

Ndiyakuthandala! Ginger gave Griffin 16 shots."
245	There are 4 reefs in the aquarium and 32 in the aquarium, The difference in the number of reefs in the two areas is twice the number of fish in the two areas. If the aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each area?	7	"Ndi aju nke! (I will answer!)

Let's call the number of fish in each area ""x"". Since the difference in the number of reefs is twice the number of fish, we can set up the equation:

32 - 4 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each area. Ndi aju! (I have answered!)"
246	A person who makes jeans for his face charges $250 an hour. He needs expensive make-up for a movie that he's taking six hours to make four times a week. The movie takes five weeks to complete. After the movie the person who makes jeans takes 10% off depending on the work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	Ko ko ko! Mwanaume anayofanya jeans kwa uso anachukua $250 kwa saa. Anahitaji makeup ya kubwa kwa filamu ambayo anatakiwa kufanya kwa saa sita kwa wiki sita. Filamu inakamilika kwa wiki tano. Baada ya filamu, mwanaume huyo anapata 10% kwa kazi iliyofanywa. Mwanaume huyo anafanya kazi kwa saa sita kwa wiki sita, hivyo anachukua $250 x 6 = $1500 kwa wiki. Kwa wiki tano, anachukua $1500 x 5 = $7500. Kwa 10% kazi iliyofanywa, anapata $7500 x 0.10 = $750. Kwa jumla, Jean anachukua $7500 + $750 = $8250.
