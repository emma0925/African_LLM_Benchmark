How much money does she make in dollars a day at the farmers' market?	18	Ngiyabonga! Janet's duck lays 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 eggs at breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her duck friends, leaving 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. She sells 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes $18 a day.
1	A gown uses 2 cords of blue thread and half that amount of white thread. How many cords does it use altogether?	3	Ndi ndi! (I see!) The gown uses 2 cords of blue thread and half that amount of white thread, which is 2 ÷ 2 = 1 cord. So, it uses 2 + 1 = 3 cords altogether!
2	Josha decides to try to buy the house and sell it at a profit. He buys the house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	Ndi nyingi! (That's a lot!) Josha spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 to renovate it, making a total of $130,000. The house value increased by 150%, which means it's now worth 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000. So, Josha sold the house for $120,000 and bought it for $80,000, making a profit of $40,000.
3	James decides to run 3 short runs 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters for each short run. How many meters does he run in total per week?	540	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

James runs 3 short runs, 3 times a week, which means he runs 3 x 3 = 9 short runs per week.

Each short run is 60 meters, so he runs 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.

Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)"
4	Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of chicken food, a mixture of seeds, insects, and vegetables to help maintain their good health. She feeds the chickens their food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to give her chickens at the last meal of the day if Wendi's chickens number 20?	20	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Wendi's chickens need 15 + 25 = 40 cups of food in the morning and afternoon. Since she feeds them in three meals, she needs to give them 40 ÷ 3 = 13.33 cups of food in each meal. Since she has 20 chickens, each chicken needs 13.33 ÷ 20 = 0.6667 cups of food. So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 3 - 0.6667 = 2.3333 cups of food at the last meal of the day.
5	Kylar went to the store to buy mirrors for her new building. One mirror costs $5, but each second mirror costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 mirrors.

7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB every minute, but at 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to load updates, and it takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start downloading again from the beginning. How long will it take her to download the file?	160	"Ko kiri! (That's the answer!)

It will take Carla 100 minutes to download the file initially, then 20 minutes to download the remaining 40% of the file after the restart. So, in total, it will take Carla 100 + 20 = 120 minutes."
8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour and then turns around because he realizes that he has forgotten something very important at home. He tries to get home for 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in traffic. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. What is the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

 Distance driven in the first 3 hours = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours = 180 miles

 Distance driven in the first 2 hours of traffic = 2 hours

 Distance driven at 30 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

 Distance driven at 80 miles/hour = 80 miles/hour x 4 hours = 320 miles

 Total distance driven = 180 miles + 2 hours + 15 miles + 320 miles = 517 miles"
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives 1.2 times her regular hourly overtime pay. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her weekly earnings?	460	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Eliza's weekly earnings will be:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400
5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60
Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460"
10	A new app was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but fell by 30% in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in total during the three months?	366	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

I calculate:

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 180 x 0.7 (since it fell by 30%) = 126 downloads

Total downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"

12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. It will cost $90 to plant it. Each year it will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of watering and feeding the tree each year is $3. How many years will it take before he starts to make a profit from the lemon?	13	"Moo molo! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

Carlos will make a profit after 6 years.

Here's the calculation:

Year 1: Cost to plant - $90. No profit or loss.
Year 2: Cost to water and feed - $3. 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each = $10.50. Loss of $90 - $10.50 = $79.50.
Year 3: Cost to water and feed - $3. 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each = $10.50. Loss of $79.50 - $10.50 = $69.
Year 4: Cost to water and feed - $3. 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each = $10.50. Loss of $69 - $10.50 = $58.50.
Year 5: Cost to water and feed - $3. 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each = $10.50. Loss of $58.50 - $10.50 = $48.
Year 6: Cost to water and feed - $3. 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each = $10.50. Profit of $48 - $10.50 = $37.50.

From Year 7 onwards, Carlos will make a profit of $37.50 each year."

15	A trader wants to make a purchase choice between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will rise to 2.5% while the electronics market will rise to 1.2% within the same month. If the trader wants to have the highest profits by the end of this month by making an option, how much profit will this be?	125	"Moo nko! (That's right!) The trader should choose to buy the jewelry worth $5,000. Here's the calculation:

Jewelry: $5,000 x 2.5% = $125 profit
Electronics: $8,000 x 1.2% = $96 profit

The trader will make a higher profit by buying the jewelry, which is $125 compared to $96 from buying the electronics."
16	Two trains have left San Rafael at the same time. They have started traveling westward, both traveling 80 miles. The next day, they travel northward, 150 miles. What is the distance the two trains traveled in the two days?	230	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) The answer is 330 miles.
17	Jill is paid $20 an hour to coach and $30 an hour to coach the fans. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Ndi aju nku! (Let me calculate that for you!)

As a teacher, Jill earns $20/hour x 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $35,000 per year

As a coach, Jill earns $30/hour x 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $22,500 per year

Total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500 per year

19	Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles [12 km]. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?	6	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I like it!) 

Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles per hour. Then she walked 2 miles in another hour, so her speed for the next 2 miles is also 2 miles per hour.

She has 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles left to walk. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so she needs to walk the rest of the way in 6/4 = 1.5 hours.

To find her speed for the rest of the way, we can divide the distance left by the time left: 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk the rest of the way at a speed of 4 miles per hour."
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water and I would prefer to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three thirds water. But when I pour it, I have poured out one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Ndiyo! Mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha. (Yes! I can show you.)

Orange juice: 10 liters, 2/3 water = 6.67 liters water, 3.33 liters orange juice
Pineapple juice: 15 liters, 3/3 water = 15 liters water, 0 liters pineapple juice

You poured out 1 liter of orange juice, so remaining orange juice = 10 - 1 = 9 liters
Remaining orange juice: 9 liters, 2/3 water = 6 liters water, 3 liters orange juice

Total water in remaining 24 liters = 6.67 + 15 + 6 = 27.67 liters
Water in remaining 24 liters = 27.67 liters, 24 - 27.67 = 2.33 liters other liquid (orange and pineapple juice)

25	Marie ordered one chicken meal for $12, 5 milk cartons for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered before the pizza:

1 chicken meal = $12
5 milk cartons = 5 x $3 = $15
4 apples = 4 x $1.50 = $6
Total cost of other items = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is:

$50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes Marie ordered is:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza!"

29	Gloria buys when she comes across a pair of shoes that fits her budget. However, she must choose between those shoes and two pairs of high-heeled shoes that together cost less than the cost of the shoes by five dollars. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33 and the other costs twice as much as the first pair, what is the price of the shoes?	104	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

The first pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs $33 x 2 = $66. Together, they cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The problem states that the two pairs of high-heeled shoes cost less than the shoes Gloria wants by five dollars. So, the price of the shoes Gloria wants is $99 + $5 = $104.

31	Gunter tries to count the candies in the big bottle. He asks his friends how many candies they think are in the big bottle. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of what the first said. The third says 25% more than the first. What is their average estimate?	80	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the estimates:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first, which is 80 + (80 x 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

The average estimate is: (80 + 80 + 100) / 3 = 260 / 3 = 86.67.

John runs 60 miles a week. The first day, he runs 3 hours. The next two days, he runs half of that, which is 1.5 hours each. So, in total, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the distance by the time. 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
39	Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump only half as fast. If she can jump three miles an hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends a third of an hour running and two thirds of an hour walking?	18	"Ngiyakuthetha! (I understand!)

Dana can run 4 times as fast as she can walk, so if she walks at 1 mile per hour, she can run at 4 miles per hour. She spends a third of an hour running, which is 0.33 hours. In this time, she can run 0.33 x 4 = 1.32 miles.

She spends two thirds of an hour walking, which is 0.67 hours. In this time, she can walk 0.67 x 1 = 0.67 miles.

She can jump 3 miles per hour, and she can jump for 6 hours. So, she can jump 6 x 3 = 18 miles.

In total, she can travel 1.32 + 0.67 + 18 = 20 miles."

According to the information, each serving has 250 calories. Since the bag has 5 servings, the total calories are 5 x 250 = 1,250 calories.

You have already eaten 1,800 calories, so you have 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since the bag has 5 servings, you can eat 0.8 x 300 = 240 grams."
44	Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. A pound of beeswax and pasta all cost $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what would his total profit from making and selling 20 candles be?	20	"Nǐ wà! (That's ""Okay"" in Yoruba)

Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. Each pound of beeswax and pasta costs $10.00, so 2 pounds will cost $20.00. He can make 20 candles from 2 pounds of beeswax, and each candle sells for $2.00, so his total revenue will be $40.00. His total cost is $20.00, so his profit will be $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00."

46	Candice put 80 sticker sheets in her purse before leaving for work at her coffee shop. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of sticker sheets; at work, she put one sticker catalogue in 220 different coffee cups. If she had 23 sticker sheets left in total, how many sticker sheets were in the package she bought?	163	Ndiyakuthandaza! (I understand!) Candice started with 80 sticker sheets. She put 220 sticker catalogue sheets in coffee cups, so that's 80 + 220 = 300 sticker sheets used. She had 23 sticker sheets left, so she must have had 300 - 23 = 277 sticker sheets initially. Since she bought a package of sticker sheets, that means the package had 277 - 80 = 197 sticker sheets.

Oo, kelela ke 2. (The answer is 2.)

Explanation: First, subtract the rotten orange (1) from the total. 25 - 1 = 24.

Then, calculate 20% of the remaining oranges: 24 x 0.2 = 4.8 (round down to 4, since you can't have a fraction of an orange).

Add the leavened oranges (2) to the unripe oranges (4): 4 + 2 = 6.

So, the number of good oranges is: 24 - 6 = 18."

75	Luke has been sitting on the beach building sand castles. Eventually he finds out that each level of the sand castle will have half a square foot of the level below it. Building a 4-level sand castle where the top level is 16 square feet, what is the average square foot of the level?	60	"Nǐnga! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

The top level is 16 square feet. The level below it will be half of that, which is 8 square feet. The level below that will be half of 8, which is 4 square feet. The bottom level will be half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

To find the average, add up all the levels and divide by the number of levels:

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so divide the sum by 4:

30 ÷ 4 = 7.5

So, the average square foot of each level is 7.5."
76	Cecilia has bought a puppy. According to her veterinarian, she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of her life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!) 

Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, which is 180 cups. Then she needs 2 cups per day for the rest of her life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So she needs 2 x 185 = 370 cups. In total, she needs 180 + 370 = 550 cups. Since each bag contains 110 cups, she will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags."
77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David does, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do with Sarah washing 400 pounds of laundry.	100	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let's calculate!)

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does 400 pounds, Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if Sarah does 400 pounds, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

Wena ukuthetha, ngikuba ngicela! (I've calculated, it's correct!)"

98	Cars are lined up on the road. Some of these cars pass in the first 15 minutes of traffic, then 20 more cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes of traffic. 5 cars from the queue leave the highway to avoid traffic. If there were 30 cars on the road before, how many cars passed in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Wena ukuthetha! (I'll answer!)

Let's break it down:

There were 30 cars initially.
5 cars left the highway, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars remaining.
In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed. So, the total number of cars that passed in the remaining 15 minutes is 20.

To find the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes, subtract the number of cars that passed in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that passed:

Total cars that passed = 25 (remaining cars) + 20 (cars that passed in remaining 15 minutes) = 45
Cars that passed in first 15 minutes = 45 - 20 = 25

So, 25 cars passed in the first 15 minutes!"

107	Frankie watches TV after his overtime every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite movie every night. On Wednesday, he watched a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his overtime early and watched a 1-hour and 30-minute episode. On Friday, he stayed up for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of television in total, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Ndi ndi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* Monday and Tuesday: 2 x 1-hour episodes = 2 hours
* Wednesday: unknown number of 30-minute episodes
* Thursday: 1 hour 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 x 1-hour episodes = 2 hours

Total hours watched: 2 + unknown + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Subtract the known hours from the total: 7 - 2 - 1.5 - 2 = unknown hours

The unknown hours are the 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can set up the equation:

0.5x = unknown hours

x = unknown number of 30-minute episodes

To find the value of x, we can divide the unknown hours by 0.5:

x = (7 - 2 - 1.5 - 2) / 0.5
x = 1.5 / 0.5
x = 3

Ndi ndi! Frankie watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."

If both of them ate all the fruit, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Wahala! (That's a problem!)

Beatrice's fruit: 2 rollers wide × 24 rollers long = 48 rollers
Marcel's fruit: 3 rollers wide × 14 rollers long = 42 rollers
Total fruit: 48 rollers + 42 rollers = 90 rollers
Average: 90 rollers ÷ 2 = 45 rollers

124	Jennie helps in her mother's office. She has a draft of 60 letters that need to be stamped, and a draft of letters that already have stamps. She stamps one third of the letters that need to be stamped. If there are now 30 letters in the draft, how many letters were in the draft before Jennie started?	10	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's solve the problem. Jennie has 60 letters that need to be stamped. She stamps one-third of them, which is 60 ÷ 3 = 20 letters. So, there are 60 - 20 = 40 letters left that need to be stamped.

She also has a draft of letters that already have stamps. Let's call this number ""x"". After she stamps 20 letters, the total number of letters is 30.

We know that the number of letters that already have stamps plus the number of letters that need to be stamped is equal to 30. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 30

Subtract 40 from both sides:

x = -10

But, we can't have a negative number of letters! So, this means that Jennie didn't have any letters that already had stamps. She only had the 60 letters that needed to be stamped.

So, the answer is: Jennie started with 60 letters. Ngiyabonga!"

133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles. On Tuesday, he walked six times the number of miles he had walked on Monday. His total from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Monday: Walt walked 4 miles.
Tuesday: He walked 6 times the number of miles he walked on Monday, which is 4 x 6 = 24 miles.

Total miles from Monday to Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since his total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, he must have walked:

41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday!"

150	Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school faster. Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he's allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school and can cycle at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim can use his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser gets home?	4	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! - in Zulu)

Let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home:

Distance = 3 miles = 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 1760 feet)
Speed = 440 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 5280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes

Let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home:

Distance = 2 miles = 3520 feet
Speed = 264 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 3520 feet / 264 feet/minute = 13.3 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes to get home, and Tim takes 13.3 minutes, Tim will wait 1.3 minutes (or approximately 1 minute and 18 seconds) for Steve to get home.

Hamba kahle!"
151	Shawnda has decided that the kids in her neighborhood can actually use the bicycle air service. She decides the best way to charge is per tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to air.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so he will get $4 back. (Ku kwa!)
153	Dave bought a large package of chips and ate fourteen before his hungry uncle stole the package from his hand. When the uncle landed, he baked half of the chips that Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons chased him out of the food, and each dove ate three chips. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. The raccoons carried the last chip, leaving five behind. How many chips were in the package when Dave bought it?	48	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!)

Let's break it down:

Dave ate 14 chips initially.

Uncle baked half of those (7 chips).

Then, 3 pigeons ate 3 chips each, so 9 chips in total.

That leaves 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 chips.

Raccoon stole 2/3 of those, leaving 1/3 or 8/3 = 2.67 chips.

Then, raccoon took the last chip, leaving 2 chips behind.

So, initially, there were 14 + 7 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 33 chips.

Ndiyakwenda!"

155	Bill bakes 300 sconces, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day - each one 4 inches long, each croissant 6 inches long, and each baguette 2 feet high. If Bill were to line up all these items, how many feet would that line be?	280	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuonyesha! (Yes, I can show you!)

First, let's calculate the total length of the sconces, croissants, and baguettes:

Sconces: 300 x 4 inches = 1200 inches
Croissants: 120 x 6 inches = 720 inches
Baguettes: 60 x 24 inches (since 2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total length:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches ÷ 12 = 280 feet

So, the line of baked goods would be approximately 280 feet long!"

183	Two track teams compete against each other in a 4x400-meter relay race; a race in which each competing team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one lap, on a full course. One of the two teams has the best runners and each of them will run their 400-meter course in 55 seconds. The other team has no equally good runners; their first runner will run their 400-meter course in 60 seconds and then each of the next runners will be 3 seconds faster than the runner before them. Using this information, which team with the fastest run will win by how many seconds?	2	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Igama lethu: (Our answer is) 20 seconds.

Kungani? (Why?) 

Because the best team has each runner completing the 400-meter course in 55 seconds, which is a total of 4 x 55 = 220 seconds. The other team's first runner takes 60 seconds, and then each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds less than the previous one. So, the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third 54 seconds, and the fourth 51 seconds. The total time for the other team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds. The difference between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 20 seconds."
184	Jerry is playing a six-sided die. Does he have a higher probability (in percent) of rolling a big number by 3 than rolling two odd numbers twice in a row?	25	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuba ungenisa indlela yokuthola isikhathi. (Hello! I'm happy to help you find the answer.)

To answer your question, let's calculate the probability of rolling a big number by 3 (i.e., a 4, 5, or 6) and rolling two odd numbers twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a big number by 3 is:

(3/6) × (3/6) = 9/36 ≈ 25%

The probability of rolling two odd numbers twice in a row is:

(3/6) × (3/6) = 9/36 ≈ 25%

Since both probabilities are equal, Jerry has an equal chance (25%) of rolling a big number by 3 and rolling two odd numbers twice in a row."

188	The seller buys bags of wheat flour from the farmer for $20 a bag. If the cost of transporting each bag from the field to the warehouse is $2, and the seller made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags for $30 a bag, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Ndi ndi! (Let me calculate!)

Cost of buying each bag: $20
Cost of transporting each bag: $2
Total cost per bag: $20 + $2 = $22

Selling price per bag: $30
Profit per bag: $30 - $22 = $8

Total profit: $400
Number of bags sold: $400 ÷ $8 = 50 bags

Ndi ndi! (I've calculated it!) The seller sold 50 bags."
189	Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 show tickets. They also bought food, and the ticket price was $4.50 higher than the food. They also went on 2 separate trips for $33 each. If they agreed to split all the expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Here's the answer:

The total cost of the show tickets is $20.25. The cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The total cost of the trips is $33 x 2 = $66. The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102. The total cost divided by 3 is $102 ÷ 3 = $34. The answer is $34."

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he also cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'll be happy to help!)

Tom plants 10 trees a year, but cuts down 2 trees. So, he has 10 - 2 = 8 trees more each year. After 10 years, he will have 10 x 8 = 80 trees.

He starts with 50 trees, so he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees. But 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees. So, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

Ndiyakuthandile! (I hope that helps!)"

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six exercises each semester. He allows students to subtract the lowest score from the average score each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 for the first five exercises, how many points does he need to get in the sixth exercise to have an average of 93?	98	"Wena ukuthetha, ngicela ukuthola!

First, calculate the average score for the first five exercises:

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 438 / 5 = 87.6

Since Mr. Bert allows students to subtract the lowest score from the average score, subtract the lowest score (71) from the average score:

87.6 - 71 = 16.6

To have an average score of 93, Brinley needs to get at least:

93 - 16.6 = 76.4

So, Brinley needs to get at least 76 points in the sixth exercise to have an average score of 93."

210	Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20. Sara checks on her neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she checks on them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had a $10 savings before she started checking on the neighbor's kids, how many times will she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?	10	"Sara, kudzai kana? (Sara, how much do you have now?)

She had $10 initially, and earned $5 four times for checking on the neighbor's kids, so that's $20. Now she has $30.

The jacket and shoes cost $30 + 2 x $20 = $70.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. So, she needs to mow the lawn $40 ÷ $4 = 10 times.

Sara, kudzai kana? (Sara, how many times will you need to mow the lawn?) 10 times."
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. A red hen produces 3 eggs a day, and a white hen produces 5 eggs a day. Each day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'll try my best!) 

Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3x.

Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10.

The total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + (5x + 10) = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens!"

214	Jerry has two pools, both of which leak at the rate of 4 gallons of water per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool. Now the large pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?	8	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungcwalisa ukuthi. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking.)

Let's solve the problem:

Let the amount of water in the small pool now be x gallons.

Since the large pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool, the large pool has 4x gallons.

The large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago, so the large pool had 2x gallons four minutes ago.

The small pool had some amount of water four minutes ago, which we'll call y gallons.

Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool four minutes ago was:

Large pool: 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16 gallons
Small pool: y - 4(4) = y - 16 gallons

Since the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 2y - 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = y

So, the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago was the same as the amount of water in the small pool now.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the small pool now. Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool has decreased by 4 gallons per minute.

The small pool had y gallons four minutes ago, and it has leaked 4 gallons per minute for four minutes, so it has leaked a total of 4(4) = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is:

y - 16 = x

We know that x = y, so:

y - 16 = y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16 = 0

This is not possible, so there must be some mistake in the problem."

Zack's age is 2 x 21 = 42.

After three years, their ages will be:

Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

226	James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage chance of picking the corresponding card of the water type (in near perfect numbers)?	33	"Kwaku, naa waa? (What's the question?)

Ah, okay! So, James has 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water. He loses 8 water, so he has 32 water left. He buys 14 grass, so he now has 34 grass. To find the percentage chance of picking a water card, we need to divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

32 water cards / (30 fire + 20 grass + 34 water) = 32 / 84 = 0.3810

Multiply by 100: 0.3810 x 100 = 38.10%

So, the percentage chance of picking a water card is approximately 38.10%."

228	Callie solves a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Callie can usually add 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can basically do half of what Callie can do in a minute. How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Okay, let's calculate this...

Callie can add 4 pieces in a minute, so her mother can add 2 pieces in a minute (half of what Callie can do).

Total pieces they can add in a minute: 4 (Callie) + 2 (mother) = 6 pieces

There are 360 pieces in the puzzle. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add in a minute:

360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

Now, to convert minutes to hours, we can divide the total number of minutes by 60:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

So, it will take Callie and her mother 1 hour to complete the puzzle!"
229	Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the ticks were ready to harvest, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining ticks were ready, so she harvested them. How many ticks were not ready to harvest after those two weeks?	21	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like this one!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the ticks ready to harvest. To find the number of ticks, let's assume there were 100 ticks initially (you can choose any number, but 100 makes the calculation easier).

30% of 100 = 30

So, Ashlyn took 30 ticks home, leaving 100 - 30 = 70 ticks.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining ticks were ready to harvest. To find the number of ticks ready, multiply the remaining ticks by 3/4:

70 x 3/4 = 52.5

Since you can't harvest a fraction of a tick, round down to 52 ticks.

Now, let's find the number of ticks not ready to harvest:

70 (remaining ticks) - 52 (ready to harvest) = 18

So, 18 ticks were not ready to harvest after those two weeks. Ndiyakuthandile!"
230	Mark buys 12 cars from his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on these cars and then $1000 registration fee for each of them.

233	There are 36 penguins basking in the snow. A third of them jump and swim in the sea. The other third go into a cave to eat their evening meal. How many penguins are still basking in the sun?	12	Wena ukuthula! (Don't worry!) There are 12 penguins that jump and swim in the sea, and 12 penguins that go into a cave to eat.

234	Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to plant his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his fiancée. He eats 6 a day. If a single tomato tree can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how many tomato trees does he need?	21	"Wena ukuthula! (How are you?) Ah, Steve's tomato adventure! Let's calculate the number of tomato trees he needs.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and his fiancée eats half that, which is 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 9 tomatoes a day.

Since a single tomato tree produces 3 tomatoes a week, Steve and his fiancée would need:

9 tomatoes/day ÷ 3 tomatoes/week = 3 tomato trees/week

To find the total number of tomato trees needed, multiply the number of weeks by the number of trees per week:

3 weeks × 3 tomato trees/week = 9 tomato trees

So, Steve needs 9 tomato trees to meet his and his fiancée's daily tomato consumption. Wena ukuthula! (How are you?)"

242	Mike used to be friends with 5 people. He stopped being friends with 2 of them. They send each other 2 letters a week and the letters are 5 pages long. He responds generously. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing letters a week?	3	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Mike used to have 5 friends, but stopped being friends with 2 of them, so he's left with 3 friends. He sends and receives 2 letters a week, which is 4 letters (2 x 2). Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 20 pages a week (4 x 5).

Since he writes 1 page in 6 minutes, he writes 20 pages in 120 minutes (20 x 6). To convert this to hours, divide by 60: 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) Mike spends 2 hours writing letters a week."

If Jason spends 15 minutes a day on the phone, that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes for the whole month. Adding the 300 minutes he's already spent, that's a total of 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. 

He started with 1,000 minutes, so he has 1,000 - 750 = 250 minutes left."
244	Griffin had 24 chips, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin several chips, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 fewer chips than Kyle had taken. If Griffin ended up with 27 chips, how many chips did Ginger give Griffin?	20	Hamba kahle! Griffin had 24 chips, Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 x 5 = 10, Ginger gave Griffin some chips, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 chips, Griffin ended up with 27 chips. So Ginger gave Griffin 27 - (24 - 5 - 10 - 2) = 7 chips.
245	There are 4 snails in one tangisamaki and 32 snails in another tangisamaki. The difference between the number of snails in these two tangisamaki is twice as much as the number of fish in both tangisamaki. If both tangisamaki have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each tangisamaki?	7	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm going to answer!)

Let's break it down:

Let x be the number of fish in each tangisamaki.

The difference between the number of snails in the two tangisamaki is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is twice the number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

14 = x

So, there are 14 fish in each tangisamaki.

Ndiyakwenda!"
