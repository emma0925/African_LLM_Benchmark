19	Marissa takes an hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the 2 miles. If you want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) needed to walk the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's calculate the total distance Marissa has walked so far: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

She took 2 hours to walk this distance, so her average speed is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

To find the remaining distance, subtract the distance she has already walked from the total distance: 8 miles - 6 miles = 2 miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 2 miles in 2/4 = 0.5 hours.

Therefore, the speed needed to walk the remaining distance is 2 miles / 0.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)"
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice two-thirds of the water and I want to add them to 15 liters of pineapple juice three-fifths of the water. But when I drink it, I've wasted 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Ndi kwa! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

You have 10 liters of orange juice, and two-thirds of it is water. So, 2/3 × 10 = 6.67 liters of water (round it to 6.7 liters).

You have 15 liters of pineapple juice, and three-fifths of it is water. So, 3/5 × 15 = 9 liters of water.

You add the two juices together, which gives you 10 liters of orange juice + 15 liters of pineapple juice = 25 liters of juice.

You wasted 1 liter of orange juice, so you have 25 - 1 = 24 liters of juice left.

Now, let's find the total water content:

From orange juice, you have 6.7 liters of water.
From pineapple juice, you have 9 liters of water.
Total water content = 6.7 + 9 = 15.7 liters.

So, there are 15.7 liters of water left in the 24 liters of juice.

Ndi kwa! (I've answered!)"

24	Kyle purchased last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is a 25% discount. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ukubonga ukuthi uthole indlela yokuthola isonto esikhulu esikhulu. (I'm glad I could help you find the original price.) 

If the discount is 25%, that means the original price minus the discount is equal to the discounted price. 

Let's call the original price ""x"". Then, the discounted price is 0.75x (since 25% of x is 0.25x, and 0.25x is equal to 0.75x minus x). 

We know the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
25	Marie ordered one chicken dish for $12.5 milk packs for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid $50 in total. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	Kwaku, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

In total, Mishka spent 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 dollars on all the clothing items.
27	Cynthia eats one ice cream every night. She buys 15 boxes of ice cream at a cost of $4 a box. After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?	16	Sabi la, Cynthia yoo yoo! (I know, Cynthia!) She buys 15 boxes of ice cream at $4 per box, that's 15 x $4 = $60 per night. After 60 days, she will spend 60 x $60 = $3600.
28	Henry stopped twice during his 60-mile bicycle trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?	25	"O lebogang, ke kgona go tswa ka kgosi! (That's an easy one!) 

Henry stopped after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, the end of the trip is 60 miles. So, his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop (20 miles) from the distance of his second stop (45 miles). 

45 - 20 = 25 miles. O lebogang, ke kgona go tswa ka kgosi! (That's the answer!)"
29	Gloria buys shoes when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she still has to choose between the boots and two pairs of shoes that cost a total of five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of shoes costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?	104	"Wena ukuthula! (What's the question?)

Let's break it down: One pair of shoes costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so it costs $33 x 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of shoes is $33 + $66 = $99.

The boots cost $5 more than the two pairs of shoes, so the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

Wena ukuthula! (That's the answer!)"
30	Darrell and Allen's average age is 7:11: If their combined age is now 162, count Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	Kwaku, Allen's age 10 years from now yɛ 82.
31	Gunter tries to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says there are 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What is their average estimate?	80	"Wena, ngicela ukuthula! (Let's talk, my friend!)

First, let's calculate the first half of 80, which is 40. The second friend says there are 20 more than the first half, so that's 40 + 20 = 60. The third friend says there are 25% more than the first half, which is 25% of 40, which is 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the average of their estimates: (80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33.

So, the average estimate is 63.33. Wena, ngicela ukuthula! (Let's talk, my friend!)"

41	A giant dragon, Perg, sat atop Mount Farbo, breathing fire at anything within 1,000 meters. Polly could shoot a golden eagle, the only weapon capable of penetrating a dragon, at a distance of 400 meters, but within range of the dragon's flame. But when Polly held a sapphire stone, she could shoot the eagle three times as far as if she had not held the stone. If she held the stone, how far from reaching the flames could the dragon stop Polly and hit the golden eagle?	200	"Ndi ku chaka! (That's a tough one!) 

Polly can shoot the eagle 400 meters without the stone. With the stone, she can shoot 3 times as far, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 meters. The dragon's flames stop Polly 1000 meters away. So, Polly can still shoot the eagle 1200 - 1000 = 200 meters away from the flames."
42	Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the firemen's lunch. She cut each pie into 8 pieces and placed five pies on the table for the guests to serve themselves.

Grandma Jones had 5 pies, and each pie had 8 pieces. So, she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie in total. After the guests ate, 14 pieces were left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, subtract 14 from 40: 40 - 14 = 26. The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?	48	"Moo na le wena! (Don't worry, my friend!)

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can eat:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

47	John buys red ties twice as much as green ties. Red ties are 50% more expensive than green ties. He spends $200 on green ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?	800	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

John buys 2 times as many red ties as green ties. Since he spends $200 on green ties, he must spend 2 x $200 = $400 on red ties.

Green ties cost $40 each, so he spends $200 / $40 = 5 times on green ties.

Red ties are 50% more expensive than green ties, so they cost 1.5 x $40 = $60 each.

John spends $400 on red ties, so he buys 400 / $60 = 6.67 times (round up to 7 times) on red ties.

In total, John buys 5 times on green ties and 7 times on red ties. That's 5 + 7 = 12 times on ties.

Since each green tie costs $40, he spends 5 x $40 = $200 on green ties.

Since each red tie costs $60, he spends 7 x $60 = $420 on red ties.

In total, John spends $200 + $420 = $620 on ties.

86	Greg has an alarm set to go off three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it goes off until Greg turns it off. The first time it goes off today, it goes off four times. The second time it goes off, it goes off three times as much. The third time, it goes off half as much as the second time. How many nutrients does the alarm go off in total?	22	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Let's break it down:

1. First time: 4 times
2. Second time: 3 times as much as the first time, so 4 x 3 = 12 times
3. Third time: Half as much as the second time, so 12 / 2 = 6 times

Total: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times

89	Christina is planning a birthday party and wants 75 gift bags for each boy, because a quarter of the groomsmen aren't gifts. She has invited 16 friends. The gift bags cost $2 each. How much will she spend?	24	Sawubona! (Hello!) Let me help you with that. There are 16 friends, and 3/4 of the groomsmen are gifts, so 16 - 3/4 * 16 = 8 groomsmen are not gifts. Since she wants 75 gift bags for each boy, she will need 75 * 8 = 600 gift bags. At $2 each, the total cost will be 600 * 2 = $1200.
90	Ted T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to a dinosaur picnic. Do you know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lb of potato salad, and a baby will eat half of what the old one eats?

(Ah, my child!) Let's calculate this together!

Adults: 20 x 10 lb = 200 lb
Children: 5 x 5 lb = 25 lb
Total: 200 lb + 25 lb = 225 lb

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

93	Lee used to run the 400-meter race two seconds faster than Gerald, who ran the 400-meter race. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Gerald's original time was 2 seconds slower than Lee's. Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10 percent. To find the percentage of his original time, multiply his original time by the percentage:

40 x 0.10 = 4 seconds

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds."
94	In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits is a dozen fewer than the number of domestic dogs and cats combined. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets are there in the neighborhood?	348	"Ngiyamuhle! (I'm happy to help!)

Number of dogs = 60
Number of cats = 2 x 60 = 120
Total number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Total number of pets = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

97	When Freda cooks the pickled tomatoes in the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each of the 16 cans of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Fred use?	12	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* Each can has 3 tomatoes, and Freda uses 16 cans, so that's 3 x 16 = 48 tomatoes.
* The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, so the number of cooked tomatoes is half of 48, which is 24 tomatoes.
* The sauce makes 32 ounces, but we need to find the number of tomatoes used, not the sauce. So, we can ignore the sauce for now.
* Freda uses 24 cooked tomatoes, but we need to find the original number of tomatoes before they were cooked. Since they lose half their volume, the original number of tomatoes is twice the cooked number, which is 2 x 24 = 48 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 48 tomatoes! Ndiyakuthandala!"

A quarter of 1,000 pieces is 250 pieces. So, Poppy puts 250 pieces on the board.

107	Frankie turns on the TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches 1 episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watches a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches an episode of 1 hour and a 30-minute show. If he watches 7 hours of TV in total, how many 30 episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* Monday and Tuesday: 2 episodes, each 30 minutes, so 1 hour
* Wednesday: Frankie watches a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call this number x. Total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
* Thursday: 1 hour show + 30-minute show = 1.5 hours
* Total TV time: 1 + 1 + 30x + 1.5 = 7 hours

Now, let's simplify the equation:

30x + 3.5 = 7

Subtract 3.5 from both sides:

30x = 3.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.1167 (approximately)

Since Frankie watches a few episodes, x must be a whole number. The closest whole number is 0. So, Frankie watched 0 episodes on Wednesday. This doesn't make sense, as Frankie watches a few episodes.

Let's try again:

30x + 3.5 = 7

Subtract 3.5 from both sides:

30x = 3.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.1167 (approximately)

The closest whole number is 1. So, Frankie watched 1 episode on Wednesday.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, Frankie watched 1 x 30 = 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours.

Now, let's update the total time:

* Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour
* Wednesday: 0.5 hours
* Thursday: 1.5 hours
* Total TV time: 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours

Frankie still needs to watch 7 - 4 = 3 hours more.

On Thursday, Frankie watches an episode of 1 hour and a 30-minute show. This is 1.5 hours. He still needs to watch 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours more.

Since Frankie finishes his homework early on Thursday, he can watch an episode of 1 hour and a 30-minute show. This is 1.5 hours, which is exactly what he needs.

So, Frankie watches 0 episodes on Wednesday. He watches 2 episodes on Monday and Tuesday, and 2 episodes on Thursday. In total, Frankie watches 4 episodes.

If they both ate their own amount, how many did they eat on average?	45	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! - in Zulu)

Answer: To find the total number of rolls eaten, you need to calculate the area of each roll. Beatrice's roll has an area of 24 x 2 = 48 rolls, while Marcel's roll has an area of 3 x 14 = 42 rolls. In total, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 rolls. To find the average, you divide the total by 2, which is 90 ÷ 2 = 45 rolls. So, they ate 45 rolls on average."

114	Jamali's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo. If Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamali's photo in the zoo?	6	"Wena ukuthula! (Good morning!)

Ngiyabonga, ngicela ukuthula! (Thank you, I'm happy to help!)

Let's solve the problem:

Jamali's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.
Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos.
So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photos.

The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo.
So, the number of ducks in Jamali's photo is 300 / 50 = 6.

Wena ukuthula! (Good morning!)

Ngiyabonga, ngicela ukuthula! (Thank you, I'm happy to help!)

There are 6 ducks in Jamali's photo in the zoo."
115	Sasha notices that the price of the wood has gone up by 50% in the last few months after he bought the wood. Since he has a surplus, he decides to sell it. He has ten remaining 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each. He also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that he bought for $16 each. If you sell them all, how much profit will you make?	90	Sasha, ngwana wa mokgwa! (Sasha, my friend!) Let's calculate the profit. He has 10 boards that cost $10 each, so that's a total of $100. He also has 5 boards that cost $16 each, so that's a total of $80. In total, he has $180 worth of wood. Since the price of wood has gone up by 50%, he would have paid $180 + $90 = $270 for the same wood today. So, his profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

118	The customs officer at the main clearance port at SeaSide counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each with 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles on the first day was 30. Count the number of imported containers on the second day, estimating that each container contained 5 vehicles.	4	"Wahala! (That's a problem!) 

Let's calculate the number of containers on the second day. On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles. The next day, the total number of vehicles increased to 30. So, the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 ÷ 5 = 4 containers.

Wahala! The answer is 4 containers."
119	Adrien's total salary is 30% more than Lylah's. After 4 years, her salary had increased, and she was earning 40% more than she was four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the couple was earning after four years?	95200	"Moo ntle! (That's ""Answer"" in Zulu)

Lylah's salary after 4 years = 1.4 x (Lylah's salary 4 years ago)
Adrien's salary after 4 years = 1.3 x $40,000 = $52,000

Total salary after 4 years = Lylah's salary after 4 years + Adrien's salary after 4 years
= 1.4 x (Lylah's salary 4 years ago) + $52,000

Since Adrien's salary is 30% more than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
1.3 x $40,000 = 1.4 x (Lylah's salary 4 years ago)
Lylah's salary 4 years ago = $40,000 / 1.4 = $28,571

Now, we can calculate the total salary after 4 years:
= 1.4 x $28,571 + $52,000
= $40,000 + $52,000
= $92,000

Moo ntle! (That's ""Answer"" in Zulu) The couple's total salary after four years is $92,000."

She stamps one-third of the letters that need stamping. If there are now 30 letters in the stack of stamped letters, how many were there when Jennie started?	10	"Ndiyakuthand'a! (I understand!) 

Let's break it down:

* Jennie stamps one-third of the letters that need stamping, which means she stamps 60 ÷ 3 = 20 letters.
* There are now 30 letters in the stack of stamped letters, which means there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters already stamped before Jennie started.
* Since Jennie has a stack of 60 letters that need stamping, and 10 are already stamped, that means there were 60 + 10 = 70 letters when Jennie started.

How much profit does the hospital make from visits?	10000	"Ndi kuku, ngwá ákú! (That's a tough one, let me think!)

Okay, let's break it down:

* 500 patients per day, each seen for 24 minutes, so the total time spent seeing patients is:
500 patients x 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
* Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours
* Doctors charge $150 per hour, so the hospital pays doctors: 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000
* Hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so the hospital earns: 200 hours x $200 per hour = $40,000
* Profit = earnings - expenses = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

There are 27 unicorns left in the world. A quarter of them are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 4 = 6.75 (but we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, so let's round down to 6).

Two quarters of Scottish unicorns are feral, so that's 6 × 0.5 = 3.

Since we don't know the gender ratio of the unicorns, we can't determine the number of female Scottish unicorns. But we can say that there are 3 feral Scottish unicorns, and we don't know how many of those are female!"
137	Rory ordered a sandwich for $7.50 each. Two bags of matches for $1.50 each and Two cakes for $1.00 shipping. There is an additional 20% shipping fee on the check he says and he wants to tip $5. How much will it cost to ship his order?	29	"Kwaku, Rory ka yɛn kɛkɛɛ! (Ah, Rory, I'll calculate it for you!) 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items: 
2 sandwiches = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00 
2 bags of matches = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00 
2 cakes = $1.00 shipping (already included) 
Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 = $18.00 

Then, let's calculate the additional 20% shipping fee: 
$18.00 x 0.20 = $3.60 

Adding the tip: 
$18.00 + $3.60 + $5.00 = $26.60 

So, Kwaku, Rory ka yɛn kɛkɛɛ! (Ah, Rory, it will cost $26.60 to ship his order!)"
138	Mark took a test last night consisting of 75 mice. He completed the test at an average of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another 100 questions at an average of 1. If he had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unfinished?	105	"Wena ukuthetha! (Let me calculate!)

Mark completed the first test in 8 hours, at an average of 5 questions per hour. That's 8 x 5 = 40 questions per hour. For 75 questions, it would take him 75 / 5 = 15 hours. Since he only had 8 hours, he left 15 - 8 = 7 questions unfinished.

For the second test, Mark completed 100 questions in 6 hours, at an average of 1 question per hour. That's 6 x 1 = 6 questions per hour. He completed 6 x 6 = 36 questions. Since he had 100 questions, he left 100 - 36 = 64 questions unfinished.

Wena ukuthetha! (That's the answer!)"

There are 20 cars in total. 12 are automatic, 4 are semi-automatic, and the rest (20 - 12 - 4 = 4) are also semi-automatic. So, in total, 4 + 4 = 8 cars are semi-automatic.

To find the average percentage, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars, and then multiply by 100.

8/20 = 0.4
0.4 x 100 = 40%

So, the average percentage of semi-automatic cars is 40%."

144	Kim has started her own business as a housekeeper and calculates the profit she will make from her clients. She already has three clients, but she is talking to 5 other potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in her calculations. Each client's household will need 2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning cloths. The detergent bottles will cost $2 each and the pack of cleaning cloths will cost $5 each. These are her costs. Calculate her total weekly salary to be $92. The profit is only the difference between the total salary and the total costs, so what is the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make per week?	20	"Ndiyo, kimuona! (Yes, I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning cloths. The total cost per client is:

2 bottles of detergent x $2 each = $4
1 pack of cleaning cloths x $5 = $5
Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

Since there are 8 clients, the total weekly cost is:

8 clients x $9 per client = $72

Kim's total weekly salary is $92. To find the profit, subtract the total weekly cost from the total weekly salary:

$92 (salary) - $72 (cost) = $20

So, the profit per week is $20.

To find the profit per dollar, divide the profit by the total number of clients:

$20 (profit) ÷ 8 (clients) = $2.50 per client

Kimuona, hii ni faida yake kwa kila kiongozi! (Yes, this is her profit per client!)"

153	Dave bought french fries and ate fourteen of them before the hungry sea otter ate the bag in his hand. When the sea otter came he quickly ate half the amount of french fries Dave had eaten. He was then removed from eating three of the penguins, and each penguin ate three french fries, then the raccoon stole a quarter of the remaining french fries. The ants carried off the last french fries, leaving the Five behind. How many french fries were in the package that Dave had bought?	48	"Ko kere, ko kere! (Let's calculate, let's calculate!)

Dave ate 14 fries. The sea otter ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries. So, in total, 14 + 7 = 21 fries were eaten.

The penguins ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 of them, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.

The remaining fries were 21 - 9 = 12 fries.

The raccoon stole a quarter of the remaining fries, which is 12 x 0.25 = 3 fries.

The ants carried off the last fries, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 fries.

The five left behind were not fries, but rather penguins! So, we can ignore them.

The original number of fries Dave bought was 9 + 3 + 7 + 14 = 33 fries."

156	A zoo keeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the bananas on a city farm every 2 months. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and monkeys need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas do they need to order to last 2 months?	1400	"Moo nkhono, ngwena! (That's a math problem, my friend!)

Let's calculate:

Monkeys need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas, which is the same for 2 months.
Total bananas needed for monkeys and gorillas: 200 + 400 = 600 bananas.

Adding the 200 bananas needed for other monkeys, the total is: 600 + 200 = 800 bananas.

So, the zoo keeper should order 800 bananas to last 2 months!"

Since 1 red car costs $4, 5 red cars will cost 5 x $4 = $20.

The 3 toy soldiers cost $5 each, so they cost 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs the same as 3 toy soldiers, so it also costs $15.

In total, the toys cost $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

So, the cost of a toy is $50 ÷ 7 = $7.14."

195	A pencil is as expensive as a pencil and a pencil eraser combined. A pencil costs $12 and a pencil eraser $0.30. How much will 8 pencils cost?	12	"Ndiyo, mimi ninaweza kukuambia! (Yes, I can tell you!) 

A pencil costs $12 and a pencil eraser $0.30, so together they cost $12.30. Since a pencil is as expensive as a pencil and a pencil eraser combined, it means one pencil costs $12.30. 

To find the cost of 8 pencils, multiply the cost of one pencil by 8:

$12.30 x 8 = $98.40

Hivyo, 8 pencils zinakostaa $98.40! (So, 8 pencils will cost $98.40!)"

209	A can of 20 cups costs $1,200 less than the total cost of a half-can of plates that sells for $6,000 each.	145	"Ndiyo, iwezi kubali! (Yes, I understand!) 

A can of 20 cups costs $1,200 less than the total cost of a half-can of plates. 

Let's say the cost of a half-can of plates is x.

Then, the cost of a can of plates is 2x.

We know that 2x = 6,000, so x = 3,000.

Now, the cost of a half-can of plates is $3,000.

The cost of a can of 20 cups is $1,200 less than the cost of a half-can of plates.

So, the cost of a can of 20 cups is $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.

210	Sara wants to buy herself a new coat and 2 pairs of shoes. The coat she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara takes care of 4 children of 4 neighbors, earning $5 for every time she takes care of them. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she mows the lawn. If Sara already has $10 saved before she mows the lawn for the children, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can buy the coat and shoes?	10	"Wena ukuthula, Sara ingakho ngokuqhubeka! (Listen carefully, Sara's situation is like this!)

Sara needs $30 for the coat and $40 for the shoes, making a total of $70. She already has $10, so she needs $60 more. She earns $5 for taking care of the children, and $4 for mowing the lawn. Let's calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn:

$60 (needed) - $10 (already saved) = $50 (remaining)
$50 (remaining) ÷ $4 (per lawn mowing) = 12.5 times

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 13 times to earn enough money to buy the coat and shoes. Wena ukuthula, Sara ingakho ngokuqhubeka!"
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?	4	"Ko si kere! (Let me think!) 

If the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and there are 2 chickens instead of red chickens, that's 2 x 3 = 6 eggs. 

If the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs in total, that means the white chickens produce 42 - 6 = 36 eggs. 

Since each white chicken produces 5 eggs, that's 36 ÷ 5 = 7.2 white chickens. But you can't have a fraction of a chicken, so Jerry has 7 white chickens. 

To find out how many red chickens Jerry has, subtract the white chickens from the total number of chickens. 42 eggs ÷ 8 eggs per chicken = 5.25 chickens. But you can't have a fraction of a chicken, so Jerry has 5 red chickens."

226	James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage () of the newly selected card that will be the type of water?	33	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

I calculate that James has 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards initially. After losing 8 water cards, he has 90 - 8 = 82 cards. After buying 14 grass cards, he has 82 + 14 = 96 cards. 

The number of water cards he has now is 40 - 8 = 32. To find the percentage of water cards, I divide 32 by 96 and multiply by 100:

(32 ÷ 96) × 100 = 33.33%

So, the percentage of the newly selected card that will be the type of water is 33.33%."

229	The watermelon farm produced watermelon shoots. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that an average of 30 percent of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so he took them home. When he returned after two weeks, three-quarters of the watermelons were ready, so he harvested them. How many watermelons were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Okay, let's calculate. Initially, 30% of the watermelons were ready. That means 70% were not ready. Then, after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready. So, 1/4 of the remaining watermelons were not ready. Since 70% were not ready initially, and 1/4 of the remaining were not ready, that means 70% + 25% = 95% of the watermelons were not ready after two weeks.
230	Mark bought his company a fleet of 12 cars. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays a 10 percent tax rate on the cars and then another $1,000 to register each car. How much does he pay for everything?	276,000	"Wena ukuthula! (How are you?)

Answer: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 (cost of cars)
$240,000 x 10% = $24,000 (tax)
$24,000 + $12,000 (registration) = $36,000 (total cost)

Wena ukuthula! (How are you?)"
231	Kyle and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect fish. On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more fish than Robert, who collects 20. On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many fish as on Monday. How many fish did he collect on Tuesday?	50	Sawubona! Kyle collected 20 fish on Monday, and 5 more than Robert. So Robert collected 20 - 5 = 15 fish. On Tuesday, Kyle collected twice as many fish as on Monday, so he collected 2 x 20 + 5 = 45 fish.
232	Dax went to the farm to pick apples and soaked half the garden's population of insect ants. If there were 50 ants, count the total number of insects in the garden.	75	Ndi ndi! Dax wakwala ku farm ku nyanya ndi ants 50, ndipo anu wakwala ndi ants 25. Ndipo ku garden kwa 75 insects.
233	Thirty-six penguins bathe in the sun on the snow. A quarter of them go in and float in the water. The other quarter go inside the cave to eat his dinner. How many penguins are left bathing in the tank?	12	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Ah, ngicela ukuthula! (Let me think!) 

If a quarter of the 36 penguins go in and float in the water, that means 36 ÷ 4 = 9 penguins. 

And if another quarter go inside the cave to eat, that means 36 ÷ 4 = 9 penguins again.

So, ngicela ukuthula, the number of penguins left bathing in the tank is... 36 - 9 - 9 = 18 penguins!"
234	Steve decides to start eating tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week how many vineyards does he need?	21	"Ngiyabonga! Ukuthetha kakhulu! (Thank you! That's a lot of math!)

Let's break it down:

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day.
His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 3 cherry tomatoes a day.
Together, they eat 9 cherry tomatoes a day.

Since Steve decides to grow his own, he needs to produce 9 cherry tomatoes a day.

A vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week, which is 9 tomatoes in 3 days (since 3 tomatoes x 3 days = 9 tomatoes).

To produce 9 cherry tomatoes a day, Steve needs:

9 cherry tomatoes/day ÷ 9 cherry tomatoes/3 days = 1 vineyard every 3 days.

Since Steve wants to eat cherry tomatoes every day, he needs:

1 vineyard every 3 days × 7 days/week = 2.33 vineyards per week (round up to 3 vineyards per week).

So, Steve needs 3 vineyards to produce enough cherry tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend. Ngiyabonga!"
235	John orders pizzas to share with his friends. There are 20 of his friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each person gets 4 slices. Pizzas are only sold for 8 postcards.

239	The number of students in the school hall was 1000. The hall had three entrances A, B and C which also served as exits. If after the meeting an average of 30 percent of the students left the building using exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left using exit B, and the remaining students all left using exit C, count the number of students who left using exit C.	280	"Ndi ndi! (Let me calculate!)

Initially, 1000 students were in the school hall.

30% of 1000 students left using exit A, which is 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3/5 of the remaining students left using exit B, which is 3/5 x 700 = 420 students.

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students.

All the remaining students left using exit C, which is 280 students.

Ndi ndi! (I've calculated!) The number of students who left using exit C is 280."
240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James.	21	Kulani! John has 54 candies, and James has 6 less than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert, so Robert has 54/2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies. John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.
241	Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, how many books will they end up reading together?	6	Ndi maa! (That's a clever question!) Dolly has 2 books, Pandora has 1 book. Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books. Pandora reads 2 + 1 = 3 books. Together, they read 3 + 3 = 6 books. Ndi maa!
242	Mike had correspondence with 5 people. He stopped corresponding with 2 of them. Each person sends 2 letters of 5 pages a week. He answers the same way. He can write 1 page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week.	3	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Mike corresponds with 3 people (5 - 2 = 3).

Each person sends 2 letters of 5 pages a week, so that's 10 pages per person per week.

Since Mike answers the same way, he also writes 10 pages per person per week.

In total, Mike writes 10 pages/person/week × 3 people = 30 pages per week.

He writes 1 page in 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, he needs:

30 pages × 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours

Ngiyabonga! Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
243	Jason has a schedule of 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes every day to call his boss, and he has extra minutes this month to call other people. How many minutes does he have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Jason has 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes every day to call his boss, and this month has 30 days, so he uses 15 x 30 = 450 minutes to call his boss.

He has 1000 - 450 = 550 minutes left.

Ndiyakuthandile!"
244	Ginger gave Griffin a full handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin three fewer than the number of fries Kyle had taken. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give to Griffin?	20	"Ngiyamuhle! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Ginger gave Griffin a full handful of fries, and then Colby took from Griffin three fewer than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Let's call the number of fries Kyle took ""x"". Then, Colby took x - 3 fries.

Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so we can set up the equation:

Ginger's fries + Colby's fries = 27

We know Ginger gave Griffin a full handful of fries, so let's call that ""y"". Then, Colby took x - 3 fries, so the equation becomes:

y + (x - 3) = 27

Combine like terms:

y + x - 3 = 27

Add 3 to both sides:

y + x = 30

Now, we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so we can subtract 27 from both sides:

y = 3

So, Ginger gave Griffin 3 fries!"
245	There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums. If the aquariums have the same number of alligators in them, how many alligators are in each aquarium?	7	"Kulula, ngumntu wena ukuthi izinto zilandelayo zisebenza ngokutholwa. (Let me think, my friend, and I will tell you the answer.)

The difference between the number of alligators is 32 - 4 = 28. This is twice the number of alligators in both aquariums. So, the number of alligators in both aquariums is 28 / 2 = 14.

Since the aquariums have the same number of alligators, each aquarium has 14 alligators."
246	Jean's repairman costs $250 an hour. He needs the most expensive mics for the movie he's in and it takes six hours to make a day and he needs to make a week. The movie takes five weeks to finish.

247	Isabelle bought supplies for her younger sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake mixes, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on bags of treats for guests. She divided the cost equally between her parents. How many dollars did each person say they paid?	32	Sawubona! Isabelle spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 in total. Since she divided the cost equally between her parents, each parent paid $96 ÷ 2 = $48.
248	The cook bought four bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions costs $1.50. How much did the cook spend?	300	Ngiyamuhla ngoku! (That's the answer!) The cook spent $600.
249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On the second day, Sue ate as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day. If ONE PAST has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat to her sister?	5,600	Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, and her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On the second day, Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister, which is 13 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 13 = 33 cookies. Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 33 x 200 = 6600 calories.
