14	In a dance class of 20 students, twenty percent are enrolled in the dance class, the other fifty percent are enrolled in the Jazz class, and the rest are enrolled in the hip-hop class. What percentage are enrolled in the hip-hop class?	60	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In this scenario, 20% are enrolled in the dance class, and 50% are enrolled in the Jazz class. That means 20% + 50% = 70% are enrolled in either the dance or Jazz class. Since the total number of students is 20, that leaves 30% (20 - 70 = 30) for the hip-hop class. Ngiyabonga!
15	A seller offers to buy two items: jewelry for $5,000 and electrical equipment for $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to grow 2.5% and the electrical equipment market to grow 1.2% in the same month. If the seller offers to make a profit at the end of the month, what is the profit?	125	"Kwaku, kɛnɛ nɔmɔnɔnɔnɔnɔnɔ! (Translation: Ah, my friend, let's calculate the profit!)

Jewelry: $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Electrical Equipment: $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Total Cost: $5,125 + $8,096 = $13,221

Profit: $13,221 - (Seller's Original Price) = $13,221 - ($5,000 + $8,000) = $13,221 - $13,000 = $221

Kwaku, kɛnɛ nɔmɔnɔnɔnɔnɔ! (Translation: Ah, my friend, the profit is $221!)"
16	Two trains depart San Rafael at the same time. He starts heading east, both going 80 kilometers. On the last day, they go to the top, and cross 150 kilometers. How many trains will each train cross in two days?	230	"Walaala! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili)

On the first day, both trains travel 80 km each, so the total distance traveled is 160 km.

On the second day, they travel 150 km, which means they have covered a total distance of 160 + 150 = 310 km.

Since each train travels at the same speed (80 km), the distance each train will cover in 2 days is:

Train 1: 80 km + 80 km = 160 km
Train 2: 80 km + 80 km = 160 km

So, each train will cross 160 km in two days."

Jill's salary as a teacher: 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week
Jill's salary as a coach: 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week
Total weekly salary: $700 + $450 = $1,150
Total annual salary: $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500

Let's break it down:

You have 2/3 of a gallon, which is 10 liters. Then you add 15 liters of 5/3 of a gallon, which is 15 liters. So, you now have 10 + 15 = 25 liters.

But, oh no! You spilled 1 gallon, which is 4 liters. So, you subtract 4 liters from the total: 25 - 4 = 21 liters.

Ndiyakuthandile, that's the answer! You have 21 liters left."

28	Henry stopped twice for sixty yards while riding his iron horse. His two stops were for fifteen yards before he completed the course. What distance did he cross between his first and second stops?	25	"Wena ukuthula! (No worries!) 

Henry stopped twice for a total of 60 yards. His first stop was for 15 yards, so he must have stopped for 45 yards on his second stop. To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance: 60 - 15 = 45 yards.

So, Henry crossed 45 yards between his first and second stops!"
29	Gloria was shopping for shoes and decided that the price was what she could afford. However, she had to decide between the shoes and a pair of women's shoes that both cost less than the shoes. If one of the women's shoes was $33 and the other was twice as expensive, what was the price of the shoes in dollars?	104	"Ndi mboni! (I understand!) 

The more expensive women's shoe is $33, and the other is twice as expensive, which means it's $33 x 2 = $66. Since the two women's shoes together cost less than the shoes, the total cost of the women's shoes is less than the shoes. Let's call the price of the shoes ""x"". 

The equation is: $33 + $66 < x 

Combine like terms: $99 < x 

So, the price of the shoes is more than $99. The answer is: $100."
30	The difference between Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11. If both of them are 162 years old, find out how old Allen will be ten years from now.	109	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

I understand the question. Let's break it down:

Darrell's age is 7 years more than Allen's age, which is 11 years. So, if their current ages are 162 years, we can set up an equation:

Darrell's age = Allen's age + 7
162 = Allen's age + 7

Subtract 7 from both sides:

155 = Allen's age

Now, we know Allen's current age is 155 years. To find out how old he will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

155 + 10 = 165

So, Allen will be 165 years old ten years from now.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
31	Gunter wants to count the number of leaves in a bottle. He asks how many friends they think are in one bottle. One says eighty. Another says twenty is half as much as the first. A third says fifty percent as much as the first. What is the average of all of them?	80	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

To find the average, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of friends.

The first friend says 80.
The second friend says 20, which is half of 80 (20 = 80/2).
The third friend says 40, which is 50% of 80 (40 = 0.5 x 80).

So, the total number of leaves is: 80 + 20 + 40 = 140.

There are 3 friends, so to find the average, we divide the total by 3:

140 ÷ 3 = 46.67

Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)"

If he throws the rope three times an hour, how long would it take him to cross it in six hours if he ran one of the boys three times and two of the boys three times?	18	"Kwaku, nka sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛn! (Translation: My friend, I will explain it to you!) 

Let's break it down:

* He runs 4 times faster than a man, so his speed is 4x.
* He runs the rope twice as fast as he runs, so his rope-running speed is 8x.
* He throws the rope 3 times an hour, so the rope is 3x the distance he can run in an hour.
* In 6 hours, he throws the rope 6x, so the rope is 18x the distance he can run in an hour.
* He runs one boy 3 times and two boys 3 times, so he runs 5 boys in total.
* Each boy is 1/4 of the rope, so he runs 5/4 of the rope.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes him to cross the rope:

* Distance = 18x
* Speed = 8x
* Time = Distance / Speed = 18x / 8x = 2.25 hours

So, it would take him 2 hours and 15 minutes to cross the rope in six hours."

41	The great dragon, Perg, stayed on Farbo's back, breathing fire everywhere between him and the dragon for four thousand miles. Polly was able to cast a golden spell, the only weapon she knew that could catch the dragon, at a distance of four hundred miles, where the dragon's fire would hit her. But if Polly tied the silver stones, she would be able to cast the spell three times farther than it would cost. If she tied the stones, how far would she be able to cast a golden spell to stop the dragon without the dragon's fire?	200	"Ndi ndi! (I understand!) 

Polly can cast the spell three times farther if she ties the stones. She can cast the spell 400 miles initially. If she ties the stones, she can cast it three times farther, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 miles."

43	In nutrition terms, each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If 300g of chips has 5 calories per serving, how many grams can you eat per day if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per serving?	48	"Nǐ siku, mwezi wangu! (That's not correct, my friend!) Let's recalculate. If each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and you want to eat 2000 calories per day, you can eat:

2000 calories / 250 calories per serving = 8 servings per day

Since each serving is 300g, you can eat:

8 servings x 300g per serving = 2400g per day

So, you can eat 2400g of chips per day to meet your food energy goal of 2000 calories. Ndiyo, hii ni mwezi wangu! (That's correct, my friend!)"

57	A wooden bridge can carry more than 5000 pounds of cargo. The most important thing to do is to ask the locals to wrap boxes of equal weight of 15 pounds each on the bridge. If you add the box and the empty box, the total weight is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding the capacity of the bridge?	83	"Ndi ndi! (I understand!)

Let's calculate the total weight of the boxes: 3755 pounds - 15 pounds (empty box) = 3740 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the total weight by 15 to find the number of boxes: 3740 pounds ÷ 15 pounds = 249.33 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 249 boxes

So, 249 boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding the capacity of 5000 pounds."
58	Stephen purchased the items from a mail order company. The total cost of the items was $40.00. Since this was an invoice, he charged a 25% surcharge and received $3.00 in postage. Stephen charged them $4.00 in return. In addition to the surcharge, how much did Stephen pay for the items?	57	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! - in Zulu)

Answer: $32.00

Breakdown:

* Total cost: $40.00
* Surcharge (25% of $40.00): $10.00
* Postage received: $3.00
* Return charged: $4.00
* Total paid: $40.00 - $10.00 + $3.00 - $4.00 = $32.00"

60	There's a piece of paper that weighs 25 pounds that's one-tenth as much, one-twentieth as much, two-tenths as much, and the rest is fine. How much is fine?	17	"Wena ngoku, ukuthetha ngoku! (That's a tricky one, my friend!)

Let's break it down:

* One-tenth as much is 25 / 10 = 2.5 pounds
* One-twentieth as much is 25 / 20 = 1.25 pounds
* Two-tenths as much is 25 / 10 * 2 = 5 pounds

Add them up: 2.5 + 1.25 + 5 = 8.75 pounds

So, the rest is fine, which is: 25 - 8.75 = 16.25 pounds

Wena ngoku, ukuthetha ngoku! (That's the answer, my friend!)"

63	Yesterday, he was listed among the producers of a film for which he was paid $140 a month. If the film company took a 10% interest in the first half of the year and he took a 10% interest in the second half of the year, find out how much he paid the film company for the entire year.	1596	"Kwaku, sɛn nyame! (Ah, my friend, listen!) 

First, calculate the total amount he earned in a year: $140 x 12 = $1680

Then, calculate the amount the film company took in the first half of the year: $1680 x 0.10 = $168

Next, calculate the amount he took in the second half of the year: $1680 x 0.10 = $168

Finally, subtract the amount the film company took from the total amount he earned: $1680 - $168 = $1512

So, he paid the film company $168 for the entire year."

(I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Julia spent 16 minutes on land.
* She walked 12 times out of every 10 minutes, so she walked 12/10 = 1.2 times in 16 minutes. Since 1.2 is close to 1, we can round it to 1.
* She walked 1 time in 16 minutes, which means she spent 16 - 10 = 6 minutes on the lake.
* Two liters of water flowed into the boat every 10 minutes, so in 6 minutes, 1 liter of water flowed in.
* Since she spent 16 minutes on land, and 6 minutes on the lake, the total amount of water that flowed into the boat is 1 liter.

If the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 1800, how many photographs will be taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo?	6	"Kwaku, kofi! (That's right, my friend!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 1800.
2. The number of photographs taken by tourists in Brittany is 6 times that of Jamal, so it's 6 x 1800 = 10800.
3. The number of photographs taken by tourists in Brittany is 50 times more than the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo. Let's call the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo ""x"".
4. So, we can set up the equation: 10800 = 50x
5. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 50: x = 10800 / 50
6. x = 216

Kwaku, kofi! (That's right, my friend!) The number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo is 216."
115	Sasha finds that the price of trees has gone up by 50% in the last few months since she bought some trees. She has some left over so she plans to sell them. She has ten remaining 2 x 4 x 10 tables that cost $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 tables that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit will she make?	90	"Sasha, yaa waa ka kɛlɛ! (Sasha, let me calculate this for you!)

The 2 x 4 x 10 tables cost $10 each, and she has 10 of them. So, she can sell them for $100.

The 4 x 4 x 10 tables cost $16 each, and she has 5 of them. So, she can sell them for $80.

Total amount she can sell them for: $100 + $80 = $180.

The price of trees has gone up by 50%, so she paid 50% more than the original price. Let's assume the original price was x. Then, the new price is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Since she bought the trees at the new price, she paid 1.5x for each tree. Let's assume she bought y trees. Then, the total amount she paid is 1.5xy.

She has 10 + 5 = 15 tables, so she can sell them for $180. Since she paid 1.5xy for the trees, her profit is:

Profit = $180 - 1.5xy

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:

1.5xy = $180

Divide both sides by 1.5y:

x = $180 / 1.5y

x = $120 / y

Now, we can find the value of y. Let's assume y = 10 (she bought 10 trees). Then:

x = $120 / 10
x = $12

So, the original price of the trees was $12.

Now, let's find the profit:

Profit = $180 - 1.5xy
= $180 - 1.5(10)($12)
= $180 - $180
= $0

Sasha, yaa waa ka kɛlɛ! (Sasha, I've calculated it for you!)

It seems Sasha won't make a profit by selling the trees. She might want to consider other options to make a profit."

119	Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries are higher, and Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago, what is the difference between their salaries?	95200	"Kojo! (That's ""answer"" in Yoruba)

Let's break it down:

Lylah's current salary = x
Adrien's current salary = 1.3x (30% higher)

Four years ago, Lylah's salary was 0.6x (60% lower than current)
Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3x - 400,000

Lylah's current salary is 40% higher than four years ago, so:
x = 1.4(0.6x) = 0.84x

Now, we can find Lylah's current salary:
0.84x = x => x = 100,000

So, Lylah's current salary is $100,000.

Adrien's current salary is 1.3x = 1.3(100,000) = $130,000.

The difference between their salaries is:
$130,000 - $100,000 = $30,000

129	One hospital sees five hundred patients a day. One patient is seen every forty minutes. The doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital get from these visits?	10000	"Ndi nke! (I understand!)

Kwaku, hospital yaa kwa 500 patients kwa ɛtɛ (hospital sees 500 patients daily). Patient yaa kwa ɛnɛnɛnɛ kwa 40 minutes (one patient is seen every 40 minutes). Doctor yaa kwa $150 kwa hour (doctor charges $150 per hour). Hospital yaa kwa $200 kwa hour (hospital charges patient $200 per hour).

Hospital yaa kwa 500 patients kwa ɛtɛ, patient yaa kwa ɛnɛnɛnɛ kwa 40 minutes, so hospital yaa kwa 500 ÷ 40 = 12.5 hours. 12.5 hours x $200 = $2500 (hospital revenue).

Doctor yaa kwa 12.5 hours x $150 = $1875 (doctor revenue).

Finally, each bee that had withdrawn before returning returned to the hive for the next 6 hours. So, Debra saw 15 bees come back into the hive in the last 6 hours."
148	Brittany and her mother went to the museum. The ticket price for a seat is $12 for adults and $10 for children.

Brittany and her mother went to the museum, and they bought one ticket for each child and adult. The ticket price for a seat is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gives the ticket clerk money to buy one ticket for each child and adult. 

For Brittany, the child, the ticket price is $10. For her mother, the adult, the ticket price is $12. So, the total ticket price is $10 + $12 = $22. 

If Brittany's mother got $8 in extra money, she must have given the ticket clerk $22 + $8 = $30."

Steve cycles at 440 feet per minute, and Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute. The distance to the school is 2 miles, which is equal to 5280 feet. 

Steve will take 5280 / 440 = 12 minutes to reach the school. Tim will take 5280 / 264 = 20 minutes to reach the school.

So, the winner (Steve) will wait 8 minutes (20 - 12 = 8) at home before the loser (Tim) completes the race."
151	Shawnda imagines that the kids in her neighborhood can use the iron horses to work. She imagines that the best way to pay for it is to buy tires. Each of the tires costs 25 cents if there are too many. On the first day, 5 riders on iron horses came to get enough for two tires. 3 people came to assemble high-quality iron horse tires. and finally, one person brought one iron horse. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the tires:

5 riders came to get enough for 2 tires = 5 x 2 = 10 tires
3 people came to assemble high-quality iron horse tires = 3 tires
1 person brought 1 iron horse = 1 tire

Total tires = 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 tires

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost is:
14 tires x 25 cents/tire = 350 cents

There are 100 cents in 1 dollar, so:
350 cents ÷ 100 = 3.5 dollars

Shawnda made 3.5 dollars that day!"
152	Carl buys ten bags of cookies. Each cookie contains six cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10. If Carl spends $10 on cookies, how much change does he make?	4	"Moo nkhono! (Let me calculate!)

First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl bought. Since each bag has 6 cookies, and he bought 10 bags, he bought 6 x 10 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 x $0.10 = $6.

Carl spent $10, but the cookies cost $6. So, he has $10 - $6 = $4 change."
153	Dave bought a lot of french fries, and ate fourteen before a hungry shorebird stole them from his mouth. When the shorebird landed, he headed up where Dave ate half of them. Then the pigeon got angry and forced him to pull him away from the food, and each of the pigeons ate three of the food. Later, the raccoon stole the remaining two-thirds of the food. The ants took the last french fry he had bought, and left the five there. When Dave bought it, how many french fries were in the box?	48	Ndi maa! (That's a long story!) Ah, let me calculate... Dave ate 14 fries, then half of the remaining fries, which is 7. Then the pigeons ate 3 each, which is 6. So, 14 + 7 + 6 = 27 fries left. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 18. So, 27 - 18 = 9 fries left. The ants took the last one, leaving 5. So, Dave must have bought 5 + 9 + 18 + 14 = 46 fries initially!
154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo, a college student, had three 1-hour classes each day. On Tuesdays and Sundays, he had two 2-hour classes each day.

156	A zookeeper feeds a customer at a zoo. He promises to supply every two months all the corn in the local farms. If a hen needs 200 leaves, a duck needs 400 corn, and a turtle needs 100 corn per month, how much corn does he need to grow in two months?	1400	"Ndi nyingi! (That's a lot!) 

Let's calculate the total corn needed for two months:

* Hens: 200 leaves/hen/month × 2 months × number of hens = 200 × 2 ×? = 400 leaves
* Ducks: 400 corn/duck/month × 2 months × number of ducks = 400 × 2 ×? = 800 corn
* Turtles: 100 corn/turtle/month × 2 months × number of turtles = 100 × 2 ×? = 200 corn

Total corn needed: 400 leaves + 800 corn + 200 corn = 1400 corn

So, the zookeeper needs to grow 1400 corn in two months."
157	Blake and Kelly have a contest to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They plan to do it on a soccer field 100 yards long. Blake runs backwards and forwards 15 yards.

How does the winner run farther than the loser?	80	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)

Answer: Blake runs 15 yards * 2 (back and forth) = 30 yards. Kelly runs 15 yards * 2 (back and forth) + 40 yards * 34 (to the 40-yard line and back) = 90 yards + 1360 yards = 1450 yards. Kelly runs farther than Blake."

How many fish were caught?	32	Ndiyo, ndiyo! (Yes, yes!) Anakin caught 3 large fish and Locsin caught 2 more than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 large fish. Anakin caught 3 and Locsin caught 5, so in total, 3 + 5 = 8 large fish were caught.
162	If the price of a bag of jewelry is $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then what is the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months?	92	"Mfana, ngiyabonga! (My friend, thank you!) 

After 30 months, the price of the bag of jewelry will be:

$20 x (1 + 0.20) = $24 (after 2 months)
$24 x (1 + 0.20) = $28.80 (after 4 months)
$28.80 x (1 + 0.20) = $34.56 (after 6 months)

But she will save $90 by not hiring an accountant. So, she will make a net gain of $105 - $90 = $15.
165	When Elvira was 30 years old, she received a new computer that many considered a gift. She had a total of €1500 in her household savings and thought she could save some money to buy the fabric. She went to the computer department and bought a new computer for €1090 that included a mirror, keyboard and mouse mouthpiece. She also bought a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74 and a printer for €102. How much money would she have to spend on her clothes?	77	Sawubona! (Hello!) Elvira kulela €1500, kanye kwakhe €1090, €157, €74, €102. Elvira kulela €1500 - €1090 - €157 - €74 - €102 = €77. (Hello! Elvira has €1500, and she spends €1090, €157, €74, €102. Elvira has €1500 - €1090 - €157 - €74 - €102 = €77.)
166	Sandra's housekeeper gives her four baskets of eggs every time she cares for their daughter. To make Spanish fries, she needs three eggs. If Sandra is assigned to make Spanish fries for her school fees, how many times does Sandra have to look after the children?	5	Moo na wena! (Let me think!) Sandra needs 3 eggs for Spanish fries. Each time, the housekeeper gives her 4 baskets of eggs. So, Sandra needs 3 eggs / 1 basket = 1.33 baskets of eggs. Since she can't get 0.33 of a basket, she needs 2 baskets of eggs. Each basket has 4 eggs, so she needs 2 x 4 = 8 eggs. Since each time she gets 4 baskets, she needs 8 eggs / 4 baskets = 2 times.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day, Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so he walks 5 x 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day. That's 2 days, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles.

In total, Pancho walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week."

172	There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are one year old, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, how old are all four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!) 

Let's solve this puzzle together. 

Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is one year old, that means Sally Four is 8 - 1 = 7 years old.

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 7 x 2 = 14 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (7), Sally Thirtytwo (8), Granny Red (14), and Sally Two (17). The total age is 7 + 8 + 14 + 17 = 46 years.

180	There are two candidates running to represent the standards in the Sarai school. If the winner receives four-thirds of the votes, and there are eighty voting students in the class, count the number of votes the loser received.	20	"Walaala! (That's ""answer"" in Yoruba)

If the winner receives 4/3 of the votes, then the winner receives 4/3 × 80 = 106.33 votes (round down to 106 votes).

Since there are 80 votes in total, the loser receives 80 - 106 = -26 votes (which is impossible). Let's assume the winner got 106 votes. Then the loser got 80 - 106 = -26 votes. But this is impossible, so let's assume the winner got 105 votes. Then the loser got 80 - 105 = -25 votes. But this is also impossible.

Let's try again. If the winner got 104 votes, then the loser got 80 - 104 = -24 votes. But this is also impossible.

Let's try again. If the winner got 103 votes, then the loser got 80 - 103 = -23 votes. But this is also impossible.

Let's try again. If the winner got 102 votes, then the loser got 80 - 102 = -22 votes. But this is also impossible.

Let's try again. If the winner got 101 votes, then the loser got 80 - 101 = -21 votes. But this is also impossible.

Let's try again. If the winner got 100 votes, then the loser got 80 - 100 = 20 votes.

181	Sandra, the secretary, is not pleased that Fred has brought her clothes. Sandra has ordered four more red flowers than white love. She has also ordered 200 red flowers, which is five times more than white flowers. Sandra has said that if the missing red flowers are not delivered by 5 pm, she will change the delivery person. In order for Sandra's work to continue, how many red flowers does Fred have to order for 5 orders?	160	Sandra, yaa nna! (Sandra, my dear!) According to the information, Sandra has ordered 200 red flowers, which is five times more than white flowers. This means she has ordered 200 ÷ 5 = 40 white flowers. Since she has ordered four more red flowers than white flowers, she has ordered 40 + 4 = 44 red flowers. To make it 5 orders, she needs 5 x 44 = 220 red flowers.
182	Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five and a half years older than Jan. If Jan is thirty, how old is Jean?	23	"Hamba kahle! (Goodbye! But first, let me help you with the math)

Let's break it down:

* Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so if Mark is x years old, Jean is x + 2 years old.
* Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan. So, Mark was x - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
* Since Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan, we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 28 + 5.5
* Solving for x, we get x = 34. So Mark is 34 years old, and Jean is 34 + 2 = 36 years old.

193	Sue lives in a charming neighborhood. One weekend, the manager thought she was playing tricks on Sue. On Friday morning, the manager took out 18 red rubber socks in front of Sue. On Sunday morning, the manager took one-third of the socks, dressed them in white, and put the newly-refurbished white socks back in front of Sue. Then, 18 red socks were added to the rubber sock on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, how many more non-red rubber socks than non-white rubber socks?	24	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

First, let's calculate the number of socks that were taken away by the manager. One-third of 18 is 6. So, 6 socks were taken away and dressed in white. Then, 18 red socks were added. So, the total number of socks is now 18 + 6 + 18 = 42.

The number of non-red socks is 42 - 18 = 24. The number of non-white socks is 24 - 6 = 18. The difference is 24 - 18 = 6."

228	Kalinda and her mother were doing the same work as a 360-degree telescope. Kalinda could add 4 fractions of a minute to each. Her mother could add the number that Kalinda could add in a minute. How many hours would it take them to complete these questions?	1	"Nǐ yé, kwa njíko! (Ah, my friend, let me think!) 

If Kalinda can add 4 fractions of a minute to each, and her mother can add the same in a minute, that means her mother can add 4 fractions of a minute in a minute. 

360 degrees is equal to 6 hours, so they need to add 4 fractions of a minute to each of the 360 degrees. 

Let's calculate the total number of fractions: 360 degrees × 4 fractions/minute = 1440 fractions. 

Since they can add 4 fractions of a minute in a minute, they can add 1440 fractions in 360 minutes. 

360 minutes is equal to 6 hours. 

Therefore, it would take them 6 hours to complete the task.

He paid 10% of the sales tax, which is:

$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

He also paid $1000 for each title, which is:

12 x $1000 = $12,000

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

244	Griffin had twenty-four French fries, but Kyle took five of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a small portion of his fries, then Colby took a small portion of his fries and Kyle took three of his fries from Griffin. If Griffin got twenty-seven fries in the end, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ndiyo, ngumnye! (Yes, I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 fries initially.
Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 5 x 2 = 10 fries, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
Ginger gave Griffin a small portion of his fries, and then Colby took a small portion of Griffin's fries. Let's assume Ginger gave Griffin x fries and Colby took y fries. Then, Griffin would have 9 - x + y fries left.
Kyle took 3 more fries from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 9 - x + y - 3 = 6 - x + y fries.
We know Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so 6 - x + y = 27.
Solving for x, we get x = 4. So Ginger gave Griffin 4 fries.

Ndiyo, ngumnye! (Yes, I understand!)"
245	There are six fish in one well, and two fish in another well. The difference between the number of fish in the two wells is twice the number of fish in the two wells.

246	Jeans, a celebrity therapist, earns $250 per hour. She wanted to do a very expensive set for a film in which she played a character that would take six hours to shoot every day and needed to be shot every four weeks. The film would take five weeks to complete. After the film was finished, the celebrity photographer gave Jean a ten percent bonus for the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Wena wena, ngikubonga! (Hello, I'm happy to help!)

Jean earns $250 per hour, and she worked for 6 hours a day, for 5 weeks. That's a total of:

6 hours/day × 5 days/week × 5 weeks = 150 hours

Her total earnings would be:

150 hours × $250/hour = $37,500

After the film, she received a 10% bonus, which is:

$37,500 × 0.10 = $3,750

So, Jean earned a total of:

$37,500 + $3,750 = $41,250

Wena wena, ngikubonga! (Goodbye, I'm happy to have helped!)"
247	Isabel bought a party for her younger sister's birthday party. She spent $12 for the cake items, $43 for birthday gifts, $15 for the decorations, $4 for the invitations, and $22 for the purse items for the party guests. She and her parents divided the money into three parts. How much does each person pay us?	32	Kwaku, Isabel spent $96 in total. She and her parents divided the money into three parts. So each person pays $96 ÷ 3 = $32.
248	A baker bought four sacks of doves. Each sack weighed fifty pounds. One pound of doves cost $1.50. What did the baker do with the money?	300	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ukuthola isikhathi esingekho! (It's not a story!) But I can help you with the calculation! 

The baker bought 4 sacks of doves, each weighing 50 pounds. That's a total of 4 x 50 = 200 pounds of doves.

Since one pound of doves costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300.

The baker spent $300 on the doves. What they did with the money after that is up to their imagination!"
