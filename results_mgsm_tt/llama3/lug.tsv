0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three eggs a day for breakfast and cooks four more to put in a muffin for her friends. She sells the remaining eggs at the farmer's market for $2 a day. How much does she make a day at the farmer's market?	18	Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 eggs and cooks 4 more, so she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells these eggs for $2 a day, so she makes $2 x 9 = $18 a day at the farmer's market.

2	Josh decided to try to buy a substandard house and invest money, then sell it. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the houses he bought by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Kwaku, Josh yɛn nyinaa sɛnkyerɛn mu yɛn! (Josh, you've done a good job!) 

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. So, he spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 

After renovating the house, its value increased by 150%. This means the new value of the house is 150% of the original value, which is $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000. 

Since he spent $130,000 and the house is now worth $120,000, he made a loss of $130,000 - $120,000 = $10,000. 

So, Josh made a loss of $10,000."

8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour but turns back because he realizes that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in heavy traffic. He spends the next half hour swimming at 30 miles per hour before regaining the ability to swim at 80 miles per hour in the remaining 4 hours. How long does it take him to get home in 4 hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

John drives 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, which means he travels 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Then he turns back and spends 2 hours in traffic, which means he doesn't move at all. He spends 0.5 hours swimming at 30 miles per hour, which means he travels 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles. Then he regains the ability to swim and spends 4 hours swimming at 80 miles per hour, which means he travels 4 x 80 = 320 miles.

So, in total, John travels 180 + 15 + 320 = 515 miles. Since he started from home, it will take him 515 miles / 60 miles per hour = 8.58 hours to get home."

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 60 x 3 = 180 downloads
Third month: 180 x 0.7 (since it decreased by 30%) = 126 downloads

Total downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

Ndiyo, njawulo! (Yes, that's the answer!)"
11	Toula went to the grocery store and bought dog food. She bought 3 tablespoons of donuts for $68 each, 2 tablespoons of small cakes for $80 each, and 6 tablespoons of cheesecake for $55 each. How much did she buy?	694	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unyaka kakhulu! (Hello! Thank you for asking!)

To calculate the total cost, let's add up the costs of each item:

* 3 tablespoons of donuts for $68 each = 3 x $68 = $204
* 2 tablespoons of small cakes for $80 each = 2 x $80 = $160
* 6 tablespoons of cheesecake for $55 each = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Marissa walks 12 miles. She walks the first two miles in an hour, then the next two miles in an hour. That's 4 miles in 2 hours. She has 12 - 4 = 8 miles left. To finish 8 miles in the same time, she needs to go at 8 miles / 2 hours = 4 miles per hour."
20	I have ten quarts of orange juice with two thirds water in it, and I want to add fifteen quarts of pineapple juice with three-fifths water in it. But when I divide it, I count one quart of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 quarts?	15	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

First, let's calculate the total amount of juice and water you have initially:

10 quarts of orange juice with 2/3 water = 10 x (2/3) = 6.67 quarts of water
10 quarts of orange juice = 10 quarts of juice

Adding 15 quarts of pineapple juice with 3/5 water:

15 quarts of pineapple juice with 3/5 water = 15 x (3/5) = 9 quarts of water
15 quarts of pineapple juice = 15 quarts of juice

Total juice and water:
6.67 quarts of water + 9 quarts of water = 15.67 quarts of water
10 quarts of orange juice + 15 quarts of pineapple juice = 25 quarts of juice

Now, you want to divide it into 24 quarts. You'll have:

1 quart of orange juice left (as you mentioned)
24 quarts - 1 quart = 23 quarts of juice and water mixture

Subtract the 1 quart of orange juice from the total:
23 quarts - 1 quart = 22 quarts of juice and water mixture

Now, subtract the 15.67 quarts of water from the 22 quarts of juice and water mixture:
22 quarts - 15.67 quarts = 6.33 quarts of water left

Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)"

29	Gloria is a shoe buyer who usually finds a new pair of shoes in her closet. Instead she has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of leather shoes for which she spends five dollars to buy two pairs of shoes. If a pair of leather shoes costs $33 and the second one is twice as much, how much are the boots worth?	104	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi ungcwele. (Hello! Thank you for the math problem.)

Let's break it down:

Gloria buys 2 pairs of shoes for $5.
One pair costs $33, and the second pair costs twice as much, which is 2 x $33 = $66.
Total cost of the two pairs of shoes = $33 + $66 = $99.
Since Gloria pays $5 for both pairs, the difference is the cost of the boots: $99 - $5 = $94.

The boots are worth $94. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
30	The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of . . . to 7:11. Add up their ages to 162 and figure out how many years Allen will live in 10 years from now.	109	"Kwaku, sɛnkyerɛn! (I understand, friend!)

The ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write an equation: 7x/11x = 7/11.

Cross-multiplying, we get: 7x = 7x11, which simplifies to: 7x = 77.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 11.

So, Darrell is 7(11) = 77 years old, and Allen is 11(11) = 121 years old.

Their combined ages are 77 + 121 = 198, not 162. I think there might be a mistake!

Let's recalculate. If their combined ages are 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Combine like terms: 18x = 162.

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9.

So, Darrell is 7(9) = 63 years old, and Allen is 11(9) = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old."
31	Gunter tries to count the number of jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends to tell him how many jelly beans they think he has in the jar. One says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, another says there are 20 more than the average, and a third says there are 25% more than the average. What is the average of their estimates?	80	"Nǐ! (That's ""Okay"" in Yoruba)

To find the average, we need to add up all the estimates and divide by the number of friends who gave estimates.

1. 80
2. 20 more than the average (let's call this x), so x + 20
3. 25% more than the average (let's call this x), so 1.25x

Add up all the estimates: 80 + (x + 20) + 1.25x

Combine like terms: 80 + 1.25x + x + 20

Simplify: 100 + 2.25x

Now, divide by the number of friends: 100 + 2.25x ÷ 3

Simplify: 100 + 0.75x

Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can't find the exact average. But we can say that the average is at least 100 (since that's the smallest estimate) and at most 100 + 0.75x (since that's the largest estimate).

Nínú òrò! (That's ""I hope that helps"" in Yoruba)"

34	Aaron's caps are 2 more than Siobhan's. Aaron's caps are 5 more than Raymond's. If Raymond has 40 caps, how many caps does Siobhan have?	23	Hamba kahle! Aaron's caps are 2 more than Siobhan's, so Siobhan's caps are 2 less than Aaron's. Raymond has 40 caps, and Aaron's caps are 5 more than Raymond's, so Aaron's caps are 40 + 5 = 45. Siobhan's caps are 2 less than Aaron's, so Siobhan's caps are 45 - 2 = 43.
35	Mike plays table tennis for 40 minutes; in the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 goals; in the next 20 minutes, he scores another 25%.	9	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Mike scored 4 goals in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more, which is 4 + (4 x 0.25) = 5 goals. So, Mike scored a total of 4 + 5 = 9 goals.

37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has licenses to build 13 houses for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and $5. How many building licenses does he have left?	2	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) John has 13 licenses, each worth $15. He uses the money to buy 8 video games for $20 each, which costs $160. He also spends $5, so he has spent a total of $165. He has 13 licenses, so he has 13 x $15 = $195 worth of licenses. After spending $165, he has $195 - $165 = $30 left. Since each license is worth $15, he has 30 / 15 = 2 licenses left.

39	Dana can run at four times the speed she walks, but she can stop and walk at half the speed. If she can walk at two miles [3 km] an hour, how many miles can she cover in six hours if she spends one third of that time running and two thirds of that time walking?	18	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Dana can run at 4 times her walking speed, so she can run at 4 x 2 = 8 miles per hour.

She can walk at half her running speed, so she can walk at 2 x 0.5 = 1 mile per hour.

She spends 1/3 of the time running, which is 2 hours. In 2 hours, she can run 2 x 8 = 16 miles.

She spends 2/3 of the time walking, which is 4 hours. In 4 hours, she can walk 4 x 1 = 4 miles.

In total, she can cover 16 + 4 = 20 miles in 6 hours."

41	Perg, a fierce fire-breathing serpent, perched on the summit of Mount Farbo, spewing fire at everything within 1,000 feet. Polly had the ability to hurl a golden spear, the only weapon capable of destroying a fire-breathing serpent, 400 feet high, into the serpent's lair. But when Polly touched a sapphire stone, she could hurl a spear so far away that it flew three times over the valley floor without hitting a sapphire stone. If she touched this stone, how high would Polly have to be to stand outside the fire-breathing serpent's lair, and could the fire-breathing serpent be fired with a golden spear?	200	"Ko si kwa! (That's a tough one!)

Polly would have to be at least 1,400 feet high to stand outside the fire-breathing serpent's lair, considering the distance the spear can fly three times over the valley floor without hitting a sapphire stone.

And, Ko si kwa! (That's a tough one!) Yes, Polly could still fire the fire-breathing serpent with a golden spear, even from a distance of 1,400 feet, as the spear is capable of destroying the serpent."

45	Meredith writes a blog on health insurance to send to readers every day as her full-time job. A speech takes her an average of 4 hours to research and write on it. Last week, she wrote 5 speeches on Tuesday, and on Tuesday she wrote two-fifths as many as she did on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many speeches as she wrote on Tuesday. Check out the total number of hours she spent writing speeches on all three days.	104	"Meredith, ngwana wa rena! (Hello, my friend!)

Let's calculate the total number of hours she spent writing speeches. On Tuesday, she wrote 5 speeches, which took 5 x 4 = 20 hours. On Tuesday, she wrote two-fifths as many as she did on Tuesday, which is 5 x (2/5) = 2 speeches. So, it took her 2 x 4 = 8 hours. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many speeches as she did on Tuesday, which is 2 x 5 = 10 speeches. So, it took her 10 x 4 = 40 hours.

In total, she spent 20 + 8 + 40 = 68 hours writing speeches on all three days."

Assuming an egg weighs approximately 0.25 ounces, Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs a day. That's 252 x 0.25 = 63 ounces of eggs per day.

Lloyd sells his eggs for $2 per ounce, so his daily income is 63 ounces x $2 per ounce = $126.

In a week, Lloyd makes 7 days x $126 per day = $882.

57	A wooden bridge carries a weight of less than 5000 pounds. A truck carrying identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, is allowed to cross the bridge. The weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can this vehicle reach without exceeding its own weight to cross the bridge?	83	"Mfana, ngiyakuthula! (My friend, I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry. The weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle is 3755 pounds. The bridge can carry a weight of less than 5000 pounds, so we subtract the weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle from the bridge's capacity:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight by 15 to find the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry:

1245 ÷ 15 = 82.3

So, the truck can carry 82 boxes without exceeding its own weight to cross the bridge."

75	Luke spends a day on the beach building two sandy houses, and then he figures out that each floor of the sandy palace should be half the height of the one below it. If he were to make four sandy slabs of the same size, totaling 16 square feet, what would be the average height of the two sandy slabs?	60	"Moo nkhondo! (That's a tough one!) 

Let's break it down:

Luke builds two houses, and then he figures out that each floor of the sandy palace should be half the height of the one below it. That means the top floor is half the height of the second floor, and the second floor is half the height of the first floor.

Let's call the height of the first floor ""x"". Then, the height of the second floor is x/2, and the height of the top floor is x/4.

The total area of the four slabs is 16 square feet. Since each slab is the same size, the total area is 4 times the area of one slab. The area of one slab is the base times the height. Let's call the base ""b"". Then, the area of one slab is b × x.

Since there are four slabs, the total area is 4b × x. We know this is equal to 16 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

4b × x = 16

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4b:

x = 16 / 4b

Now, we can find the average height of the two slabs. The average height is the sum of the heights of the two slabs divided by 2. The height of the first slab is x, and the height of the second slab is x/2. So, the average height is:

(x + x/2) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

(3x/2) / 2

This reduces to:

3x/4

Now, we can substitute x = 16 / 4b:

3(16 / 4b) / 4

Simplifying further, we get:

3/4 × 16 / 4b

This reduces to:

12 / 4b

Moo nkhondo! (That's the answer!) The average height of the two sandy slabs is 12 / 4b."

I calculate: 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups. 365 days - 180 days = 185 days. 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups. Total cups needed in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups. 

Since each bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags."

78	Vincent can buy 3 sets of flowers for $2.50 or 2 sets of flowers for $1. How much does he save if he buys 18 flowers at the right price?	6	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a great question!)

Vincent can buy 3 sets of flowers for $2.50, which means each set costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83 per set.

He can also buy 2 sets of flowers for $1, which means each set costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per set.

To buy 18 flowers, Vincent can buy 6 sets of flowers (18 ÷ 3 = 6) for $2.50 x 6 = $15.

Alternatively, he can buy 9 sets of flowers (18 ÷ 2 = 9) for $1 x 9 = $9.

Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the right price."

84	The football team played 22 games, they won 8 more games than they lost. How many matches did they win?	15	"Wena, ngikubonga! (Hello, I'm happy to help!) 

The football team played 22 games, and they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's call the number of games they lost ""x"". Then, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

games."

119	Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Over the next four years, her salary increased by 40 percent, more than it had been four years earlier. If Adrien's salary and Lylah's salary were the same, with Adrien receiving $40,000 four years earlier, how much would the two of them have earned in salary four years later?	95200	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years earlier, Lylah's salary was $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.

Lylah's salary increased by 40% over the next four years. So, her new salary is $30,769 x 1.4 = $43,086.

Adrien's salary increased by the same percentage, so his new salary is also $43,086.

In total, they would have earned $40,000 + $40,000 + $43,086 + $43,086 = $166,172."

Raspberries 20 atakurasa $0.50 kwa kila raspberry, kwa hiyo raspberries 20 atakurasa $10. Oranges 10 atakurasa $75 (5 x $15 kwa kila orange). Kwa hiyo, Dillon atakubali kushuka pa $15 + $45 + $45 + $45 + $10 + $75 = $240.
129	The hospital treats 500 patients a day. Each patient is treated for a whopping 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these women?	10000	"Wawili! (Ahah, let me calculate this for you!)

The hospital treats 500 patients a day. Each patient is treated for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent treating patients is:

500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, so the total cost to the hospital is:

200 hours x $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients, so the total revenue to the hospital is:

200 hours x $200/hour = $40,000

The hospital's profit is the difference between revenue and cost:

$40,000 (revenue) - $30,000 (cost) = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these patients!"

Mark completed the first 75 questions in 8 hours, which is 75 / 8 = 9.375 questions per hour. Since he can't complete a fraction of a question, he completed 9 questions in the first hour and 6 questions in the remaining 7 hours, for a total of 15 questions. This leaves 75 - 15 = 60 questions left over.

For the second test, Mark completed 100 questions in 6 hours, which is 100 / 6 = 16.667 questions per hour. Again, he can't complete a fraction of a question, so he completed 16 questions in the first hour and 4 questions in the remaining 5 hours, for a total of 20 questions.

The eggs, being food, do not have a tax. So, they remain $3.

The light bulbs, cups, and towels have a 10% tax. 

Light bulbs: $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Cups: $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Towels: $4 + (10% of $4) = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

So, the total cost would be: $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $3.30 (light bulbs) + $3.30 (cups) + $4.40 (towels) = $16.60"
144	Kim starts her own housekeeping business and calculates how much profit she will make from her clients. She currently has 3 clients, but is in talks with 5 other clients and is confident enough to bring them together in her community. Each housekeeping family needs 2 bottles of bottled water and a pack of clean clothes. A bottle of bottled water will cost $2 each and a pack of clean clothes will cost $5 each. These are the only things she needs to spend money on. She calculates her average weekly income to be $2.9 The profit she has put into her housekeeping business plus the interest, so how much profit would that be, in dollars, per week, Lucas?	20	"Kwaku, nti asem! (That's the answer, my friend!)

Let's calculate the total cost of supplies per week:

3 clients x 2 bottles of water per client x $2 per bottle = $12
3 clients x 1 pack of clean clothes per client x $5 per pack = $15
Total weekly cost = $12 + $15 = $27

Since Kim has 3 clients currently, her weekly income is $2.9 x 3 = $8.7

To find the profit, subtract the total weekly cost from the weekly income:

Profit per week = $8.7 - $27 = $-18.3 (oh no, she's losing money!)

But wait, she's expecting 5 more clients, so let's calculate the profit with the additional clients:

8 clients x 2 bottles of water per client x $2 per bottle = $32
8 clients x 1 pack of clean clothes per client x $5 per pack = $40
Total weekly cost = $32 + $40 = $72

Weekly income with 8 clients = $2.9 x 8 = $23.2

Profit per week with 8 clients = $23.2 - $72 = $-48.8 (oh dear, she's still losing money!)

But, let's not forget, she's confident she can bring the other 5 clients together in her community. If she does, her weekly income would increase to:

12 clients x 2 bottles of water per client x $2 per bottle = $48
12 clients x 1 pack of clean clothes per client x $5 per pack = $60
Total weekly cost = $48 + $60 = $108

Weekly income with 12 clients = $2.9 x 12 = $34.8

Profit per week with 12 clients = $34.8 - $108 = $-73.2 (oh no, she's still losing money!)

But, let's give her the benefit of the doubt. If she can bring in those 5 clients, her profit might increase. Let's assume she can negotiate a better deal with the suppliers or find ways to reduce costs. Maybe she can get a discount on the bottled water or find a cheaper supplier for the clean clothes.

Assuming a 20% reduction in costs, her new total weekly cost would be:

$108 x 0.8 = $86.4

Profit per week with 12 clients and reduced costs = $34.8 - $86.4 = $-51.6

Kwaku, nti asem! (That's the answer, my friend!)"
145	John has a ten-hectare (10-hectare) banana plantation, with 100 oranges per hectare. John can harvest his oranges every three months. How many oranges can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Nǐgèrí! (That's a good question!) 

John has 10 hectares of banana plantation, with 100 oranges per hectare. To find the total number of oranges, multiply the number of hectares by the number of oranges per hectare: 10 hectares x 100 oranges/hectare = 1000 oranges.

Since John can harvest his oranges every three months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months ÷ 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests). To find the total number of oranges John can harvest in a year, multiply the total number of oranges by the number of harvests: 1000 oranges x 4 harvests = 4000 oranges.

He scattered 3 times as many as the original 500, so that's 3 x 500 = 1500 toys.
He scattered 1/4 as many as the original 500, so that's 1/4 x 500 = 125 toys.

So, in total, Johnny scattered 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 toys!"

156	A zookeeper feeds all the geese in the park. Every two months, he buys a supply of geese from a local farm. If a monkey needs 200 geese, a duck 400, and a monkey 100 a month, how many geese does he need to feed to last two months?	1400	Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!) Let's calculate this together. For a monkey, it needs 200 geese per month, so for two months, it needs 200 x 2 = 400 geese. For a duck, it needs 400 geese per month, so for two months, it needs 400 x 2 = 800 geese. And for another monkey, it needs 100 geese per month, so for two months, it needs 100 x 2 = 200 geese. In total, the zookeeper needs 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 geese to last two months. Ndiyo, ngwana!
157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run faster than the other in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a soccer field 100 yards long. Blake runs 15 laps. Kelly runs one lap, and decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she decides to run to the sound of 40 yards as he runs back. He does this 34 times. How much faster is the winner than the loser?	80	Moo na kwa! (That's the answer!) Blake ran a total of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. Kelly ran 40 yards while Blake ran 60 yards (100 - 40) back, and this happened 34 times. So Kelly ran 40 x 34 = 1360 yards. Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 1360 yards, so Blake is 1500 - 1360 = 140 yards faster than Kelly.

162	If a bag of colored diamonds costs $20 and this price increases by 20% every two months from the beginning, how much will a bag of colored diamonds cost after 36 months?	92	"Moo naa, kɔnɔ kɔnɔ! (Let me calculate!)

Initial price: $20
Increase: 20% every 2 months

After 2 months: $20 x 1.20 = $24
After 4 months: $24 x 1.20 = $28.80
After 6 months: $28.80 x 1.20 = $34.56
After 8 months: $34.56 x 1.20 = $41.47

After 12 months: $49.76 x 1.20 = $59.72
After 14 months: $59.72 x 1.20 = $71.66
After 16 months: $71.66 x 1.20 = $85.99
After 18 months: $85.99 x 1.20 = $103.19
After 20 months: $103.19 x 1.20 = $123.83

If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, when Sally Thirthytwo is 8 years old, what is the total age of all four birds?	51	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Let me help you with that. 

First, let's break it down:

1. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is twice the age of Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From (3), Sally Four is also 8 years old. From (2), Granny Red is 16 years old (twice Sally Four's age). From (1), Sally Two is 19 years old (3 years older than Granny Red).

Now, let's add the ages:

Sally Two: 19 years
Granny Red: 16 years
Sally Four: 8 years
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age: 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

175	Juan and his brother, Carlos, sell lemon juice for $3 a can and $2 a can of sugar, and each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans. If they made $25 in profit, how much would they have spent on the lemon?	15	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

They sell each bottle for $0.50, and each bottle contains 20 cans. So, the total cost of the cans is:

20 cans x ($2 + $3) = 20 cans x $5 = $100

They make a profit of $25, so their total revenue is:

$100 (cost) + $25 (profit) = $125

Since they sell each bottle for $0.50, they must have sold:

$125 (revenue) / $0.50 (per bottle) = 250 bottles

Now, let's find the cost of the lemon juice:

250 bottles x 20 cans/bottle = 5000 cans

Cost of lemon juice = 5000 cans x $3/can = $15,000

Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)"

189	The three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to a trade show. They spent $4.40 for a meal below the ticket price. They also traveled on 2 separate trips for $33 each.

First, let's add up the costs:

* 3 tickets: $20.25
* Meal: $4.40
* 2 trips: 2 x $33 = $66

Total cost: $20.25 + $4.40 + $66 = $90.65

Since they split the cost equally, we divide the total cost by 3:

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's calculate the number of trees Tom has left.

Tom starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, he plants 10 trees a year, so he plants a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees. However, he cuts down 2 trees each year, so he cuts down a total of 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

After 30% of the trees die, Tom has 70% of the trees left. 70% of 130 is 91. Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left. Ngiyabonga!"

Twenty cupcakes cost $1200 less than the average price of half a cup of onions, which costs $6000 each. So, the average price of half a cup of onions is:

$6000 + $1200 = $7200

Now, let's find the cost per cup of onions:

$7200 ÷ 2 (since it's half a cup) = $3600 per cup

Since the cost per cup of onions is $3600, the cost per cup of cupcakes is:

$1200 (the difference) ÷ 20 (number of cupcakes) = $60 per cup

So, the total cost per cup is $60."
210	Sara wants to buy a new jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the pair of shoes $20. Sara raises her neighbor's children four times, each time earning $5.

If Sarah had saved $10 before she started raising children, how many times would she have to cut the grass in the yard to get a jacket and shoes?	10	"Sara ayi yoo, ngwana wa kelela! (Sara, my friend, let's calculate!)

First, Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $20 for the shoes, so she needs $50 in total.

She already has $10 saved, so she needs $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 for each of the 4 times she raises her neighbor's children, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20.

She needs $40 - $20 = $20 more.

She earns $4 for each time she cuts the grass, so she needs to cut the grass $20 / $4 = 5 times.

227	Calinda works on a 360-degree rotor with her mother. Under normal conditions, Calinda can add up to 4 parts per minute. Calinda's mother can add up as many parts per minute as she can by dividing Calinda's parts in half. How many hours will it take them to complete the rotor?	9	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

If Calinda adds 4 parts per minute, her mother adds 2 parts per minute (since she divides Calinda's parts in half). Together, they add 6 parts per minute.

The rotor has 360 degrees, and each degree is 6 parts (since they add 6 parts per minute). So, the total number of parts is:

360 degrees x 6 parts/degree = 2160 parts

To find the time it takes to complete the rotor, divide the total number of parts by their combined rate:

2160 parts / (4 + 2) parts/minute = 2160 parts / 6 parts/minute = 360 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours

228	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30 percent of the melons were ripe, which she took home. When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, which she harvested. How many melons were not ripe two weeks later?	1	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Yoruba)

Let's break it down:

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the melons ripe, which is 0.3 x Total Melons = Ripe Melons

Later, she harvested 3/4 of the remaining melons, which is 0.75 x Remaining Melons = Harvested Melons

We need to find the number of melons not ripe two weeks later. Let's call this number ""Not Ripe"".

The total number of melons initially is the sum of ripe and not ripe melons: Total Melons = Ripe Melons + Not Ripe

We can set up an equation using the information:

Ripe Melons + Not Ripe = Total Melons

Substitute the expression for Ripe Melons: 0.3 x Total Melons + Not Ripe = Total Melons

Simplify the equation: 0.3 x Total Melons = Total Melons - Not Ripe

Subtract Total Melons from both sides: -0.7 x Total Melons = -Not Ripe

Multiply both sides by -1: 0.7 x Total Melons = Not Ripe

Now, we know that 3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested. The remaining melons are the difference between the initial total and the ripe melons: Remaining Melons = Total Melons - Ripe Melons

Substitute the expression for Ripe Melons: Remaining Melons = Total Melons - 0.3 x Total Melons

Simplify the equation: Remaining Melons = 0.7 x Total Melons

We can set up another equation using the information:

Harvested Melons = 0.75 x Remaining Melons

Substitute the expression for Remaining Melons: Harvested Melons = 0.75 x (0.7 x Total Melons)

Simplify the equation: Harvested Melons = 0.525 x Total Melons

Now, we can find the number of melons not ripe two weeks later:

Not Ripe = Total Melons - (Ripe Melons + Harvested Melons)
= Total Melons - (0.3 x Total Melons + 0.525 x Total Melons)
= Total Melons - 0.825 x Total Melons
= 0.175 x Total Melons

Kulani! The answer is 0.175 x Total Melons."
229	Mark buys his company a fleet of 12 cars. Each car costs $20,000. He paid 10% interest on the cars and paid $1000 to register each of them. How much does he pay for each one?	21	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!) Okay, let's calculate...

Cost of each car: $20,000
Interest paid: 10% of $20,000 = $2,000
Registration fee: $1,000
Total cost: $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $23,000

So, Mark pays $23,000 for each car."

240	Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If Dolly and Pandora both read each other's books and read theirs, how many books will they end up reading together?	21	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like this question!)

Dolly has 2 books, Pandora has 1 book. Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly now has 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books. Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora now has 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Together, they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

241	Mike's friendships with people of other races were cut short when he lost two of them. Each of them sends two letters a week, each letter about five feet long. He writes a letter again and again. He can write a whole chapter every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing?	6	Moo nkhono! (That's a lot!) Mike writes a letter about five feet long. Each of his two friends sends two letters a week, so that's 4 letters a week. Mike writes a letter again and again, so he writes 4 letters a week too. That's 4 x 5 feet = 20 feet a week. Since he can write a whole chapter every six minutes, he can write 20 feet in 6 x 20 = 120 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 120 / 60 = 2 hours writing.

244	There are 4 algae in one pond and 32 algae in the other. The difference in the number of algae in the two ponds is twice the number of fish in the two ponds. If the two ponds have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each pond?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuba ngicela ukuthula! (I love to help!) 

The difference between the number of algae in the two ponds is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is twice the number of fish, so the number of fish is 28 / 2 = 14.

Since there are the same number of fish in each pond, there are 14 fish in each pond."
