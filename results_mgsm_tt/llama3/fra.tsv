4	To keep her chickens healthy, Wendi gives them three bowls of mixed food containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables every day. She feeds them in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 more. If her farm has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food should she give them for the last meal of the day?	20	"Ndiyakwenda! (I understand!)

Wendi gives 3 bowls of food per chicken, and she has 20 chickens. So, she gives 3 x 20 = 60 bowls of food in total.

She already gave 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon, so she has given 15 + 25 = 40 bowls of food so far.

To find out how many bowls she should give for the last meal, subtract the total number of bowls given so far from the total number of bowls: 60 - 40 = 20 bowls.

Ndiyakwenda! (I understand!)"

Carla downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB. She then had to restart and start again from the beginning. She downloads at 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 80 GB / 2 GB per minute = 40 minutes to download the first 80 GB. Then she will have 120 GB left, which will take 120 GB / 2 GB per minute = 60 minutes. So in total, it will take her 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes to download the file."
8	John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns back after realizing that he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in traffic jams. For the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph for the remaining time on the 4 hours. What is the distance between him and his home at the end of the 4 hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 3 hours, John drives at 60 mph, so:

Distance = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

Then, he drives back for 4 hours, but loses 2 hours in traffic jams, so:

Time left = 4 - 2 = 2 hours

For the first half hour, he drives at 30 mph, so:

Distance = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph, so:

Distance = 80 x 1.5 = 120 miles

Total distance = 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

Okay, let's solve this problem together!

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. She sold half of what was left in the orange house. So, she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners before selling half in the orange house.

Before that, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she must have had 12 vacuum cleaners before selling those 2.

Before that, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners. So, she must have had 18 vacuum cleaners before selling a third.

And before that, she must have had... 27 vacuum cleaners!

15	A merchant hesitates between two buying plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates on a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronics market during the same month. If the merchant makes a choice that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would that profit be?	125	"Wena oka! (What's the answer?)

The merchant should buy the electronics worth $8,000. After the 1.2% increase, the value of the electronics will be $8,064. This is more than the jewelry, which will be worth $5,075 after the 2.5% increase.

So, the maximum profit would be $8,064 - $8,000 = $64.

19	Marissa is hiking a 12-mile-long trail. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to reach to walk the remaining distance?	6	"Mfana, ngikubonga! (Friend, I understand!)

Marissa has walked 4 miles in 1 hour, then 2 miles in another hour. That's a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. To find her average speed, we can divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

Now, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. Since she's already walked 6 miles, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left. To find her required speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / (12 - 6) hours = 6 miles / 6 hours = 1 mile per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 1 mile per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail."
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice made up of two-thirds of water, and I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made up of three-quarters of water, and I'm going to turn over a liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is 6.67 liters (approximately). So, the orange juice has 6.67 liters of water. Three-quarters of 15 liters is 11.25 liters. So, the pineapple juice has 11.25 liters of water.

If you turn over 1 liter of orange juice, you'll have 9 liters of orange juice left, with 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters of water.

The total amount of juice will be 9 liters of orange juice + 15 liters of pineapple juice = 24 liters.

The total amount of water will be 5.67 liters + 11.25 liters = 16.92 liters.

So, there are approximately 16.92 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of juice."

Kusukela, ngoku, Darell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. (Starting, then, Darell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.)

7x + 11x = 162. (7x + 11x = 162)

18x = 162. (18x = 162)

x = 9. (x = 9)

Darell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63. (Darell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63)

Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99. (Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99)

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109. (In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109)

Each serving has 250 calories. You've already consumed 1,800 calories, and your daily target is 2,000. So, you still have 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat 200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings.

A 300-gram bag has five servings, so each serving is 300 ÷ 5 = 60 grams.

You can eat 0.8 servings, which is 0.8 × 60 = 48 grams.

45	Meredith is a freelance blogger whose job is to write articles on health topics and submit them to clients every day. A blog post takes an average of 4 hours of work, which includes research and writing. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times as many articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles during those three days.	104	Sabi, Meredith yina kuwaka 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, yina kuwaka 2/5 times 5 articles, iya 2 x 5 = 10 articles. On Wednesday, yina kuwaka twice 10 articles, iya 2 x 10 = 20 articles. Total articles yina kuwaka, 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 articles. Each article takes 4 hours, so total hours yina kuwaka, 35 x 4 = 140 hours.

52	Uriah's sack becomes too heavy for him. He has to reduce it by 15 pounds. Each of his comic strips weighs a quarter of a pound and each of his toys weighs a half pound. If he removes 30 comic strips, how many toys will he have to remove?	15	"Kulani! (That's ""Okay!"" in Swahili)

Let's break it down:

Uriah's sack initially weighs x pounds.

Each comic strip weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic strips weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah reduces the sack by 15 pounds, so the new weight is x - 15 pounds.

The weight of the toys is the initial weight minus the weight of the comic strips: x - 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys is twice the weight of the toys: 2(x - 7.5) pounds.

To find the number of toys, we subtract the weight of the toys from the initial weight: x - 15 - 2(x - 7.5) = x - 15 - 2x + 15 = -x.

So, Uriah will have to remove x toys.

To find the value of x, we add 15 pounds to both sides: x = 15 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah will have to remove 15 x 2 = 30 toys."
53	A mechanic has different rates for repairing truck and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, he charges $60, and he charges $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, he repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repairs 12 car tires and doesn't repair any truck tires. On the day when incomes were highest, how much money did the mechanic earn in addition?	40	Nǐgì! (That's right!) On Thursday, the mechanic earns 6 x $60 = $360 for truck tires and 4 x $40 = $160 for car tires, making a total of $520. On Friday, he earns 12 x $40 = $480 for car tires. The day when incomes were highest is Friday, and he earns $480 - $520 = -$40 more than Thursday.

57	A delivery truck is about to cross a wooden bridge that cannot support a load of more than 5,000 pounds. The truck is filled with identical boxes, weighing 15 pounds each. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?	83	"Ndiyakuthandaza! (I'm happy to help!)

The truck can carry a maximum of 5,000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. So, the maximum weight of the boxes is 5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds.

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the number of boxes that can be loaded, divide the maximum weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:

1,245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds per box = 82.33 boxes

So, the truck can carry 82 boxes without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge."

How many miles can Sophie travel with just one full tank of gasoline?	300	"Kwaku! Sophie yɛn nyinaa yɛn! (Sophie, how far can you go!) 

Since Sophie has already done 100 miles, and it took 4 gallons to refill the tank, we can calculate the distance per gallon as:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

With a full tank of 12 gallons, Sophie can travel:

12 gallons x 25 miles per gallon = 300 miles

So, Sophie can travel 300 miles with just one full tank of gasoline!"

92	Emily has four children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and Jacques. Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. If Jacques is ten years and one year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?	4	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so if we call Jackson's age ""x"", Amy's age is x + 5.

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is (x + 5) + 2 = x + 7.

Jacques is 10 years and 1 year younger than Corey, so Jacques' age is Corey's age - 11 = (x + 7) - 11 = x - 4.

Now, we can set up an equation using Jackson's age:

x - 4 = Jackson's age

Since Jacques is 10 years and 1 year younger than Corey, Jacques' age is Corey's age - 11. Corey's age is (x + 7) - 11 = x - 4.

So, Jackson's age is x - 4.

94	In a certain neighborhood, the population of pet rabbits is twelve units less than that of all the pet dogs and cats. If for each dog we count two cats and there are altogether 60 dogs, how many pets are there in total in the neighborhood?	348	"Wena wena! (Hello!) Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (How are you?) Ah, math question! Okay, let's solve it!

Number of dogs = 60
Number of cats = 60 x 2 = 120
Total number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = Number of dogs and cats - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

Total number of pets = Number of dogs and cats + Number of rabbits = 180 + 168 = 348

Wena, ukuthi kuthini? (How's that?) There are 348 pets in total in the neighborhood!"

Given that there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars crossed the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

I calculate that 30 - 20 - 5 = 5 cars were left in the queue after 15 minutes. Since 5 cars got through in the last 15 minutes, that means 5 cars got through in the first 15 minutes.

100	One day, four friends visited Jerome. The first one rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second one 1/4 times longer than the first, and the third 10 times longer than the fourth. Given that the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?	175	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang it 1/4 times longer, which is 20 + (20/4) = 25 times.
3. The third friend rang it 10 times longer than the fourth, and the fourth friend rang it 60 times, so the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.
4. Now, let's add up the total number of times the doorbell rang: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175 times.

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal volume of the 3 boxes?	72	"Wena ukuthula! (Ah, good question!)

The internal volume of each box is:

5 inches (length) x 6 inches (width) x 4 inches (height) = 120 cubic inches

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension:

(5 - 2) inches x (6 - 2) inches x (4 - 2) inches = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

The total internal volume of the 3 boxes is:

24 cubic inches x 3 = 72 cubic inches

108	Henri is making cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the batch, he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than planned. He drops five of his cookies while he cools them and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?	50	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) 

Let's break it down:

Let x be the number of cookies Henri made last year.

He wants to make twice as many this year, so he makes 2x cookies.

He finds that he has made 15 more cookies than planned, so he made 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he ends up with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies.

This is equal to 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 50

So, Henri made 50 cookies last year!"

Brittany's phone can store up to 50 times more than there are birds in the photo that Jamal took, where we see ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many ducks can we see in the photo that he took?	6	Ndiyo, njia ya kufanya hesabu ni hii: Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone. Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, so Brittany's phone has a capacity of 1,800 / 6 = 300 photos. Brittany's phone can store up to 50 times more than there are birds in the photo that Jamal took. So, the number of birds in the photo is 300 / 50 = 6.

Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, assuming that all containers contain 5 vehicles.	4	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

I calculate that 2 containers with 5 vehicles each is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles. Then, 30 vehicles arrived, so the number of new containers is 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles. Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of new containers is 20 / 5 = 4 containers."
119	Adrian's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, that salary had increased and was 40% higher than what he was earning at the start. If Adrian's and Lylah's salaries have increased simultaneously, and Adrian was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.	95200	"Ndiyo, njisokoneza! (Yes, I understand!)

Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so let's say Lylah's salary was x. Then Adrian's salary was 1.3x.

Four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40% and became 1.4(1.3x) = 1.88x.

Since Adrian's salary was $40,000 four years ago, 1.3x = 40,000. So x = 30,769.

Now, their salaries four years later are 1.88x = 1.88(30,769) = 57,811 and x = 30,769.

Their total salaries four years later are $57,811 + $30,769 = $88,580.

Ndiyo, njisokoneza! (Yes, I understand!)"

Let's break it down:

* A watermelon costs 3 times as much as a pepper, so 3 x $15 = $45 per watermelon
* An orange is 5 times cheaper than a watermelon, so 1/5 of $45 = $9 per orange
* Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so 4 x $45 = $180
* He buys 20 peppers, so 20 x $15 = $300
* He buys 10 oranges, so 10 x $9 = $90
* Total amount: $180 + $300 + $90 = $570

Chopsticks: 60 x 2 feet = 120 feet

Now, convert inches to feet:
1200 inches = 100 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
720 inches = 60 feet

Total length: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

How many yards did the winner run more than the loser?	80	"Molo! (Hello!) 

Blake ran 15 laps, which is 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. Kelly ran 34 round trips of 40 yards each, which is 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. Since Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 2720 yards, Kelly ran 2720 - 1500 = 1220 yards more than Blake."
158	Raphael went to buy school supplies. He bought four pens for $1.50 each, two notebooks for $4 each and fountain paper for $20 each.

160	A water tank is 17 feet deep on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank contains 7 feet more water. On Wednesday, the water tank is two-thirds as deep as it was on Tuesday. How deep is the water tank on Wednesday?	16	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) On Tuesday, the tank contains 7 feet more water, so it's now 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep. On Wednesday, it's two-thirds as deep, which is 24 x 2/3 = 16 feet deep.
161	Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippos, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 hippos less than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish did they both catch?	32	"Wena! (That's ""Okay!"" in Zulu)

Anakin caught: 10 starfish, 6 hippos, and 3 clownfish = 19 fish

Locsin caught: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish, 6 - 3 = 3 hippos, and 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Total fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32 fish."
162	If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the starting price goes up 20% every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?	92	"Ndi ndi! (That's a lot!)

163	Several toys are arranged in a room: five red cars, three figurines and a doll. The doll costs the price of the three figurines, and a red car costs $4. Knowing that a figurine costs $5, what is the total value of the toys?	50	"Ndi ndi! (I'll answer!) 

Mfana, ngwena, ndi ndi kubona kwambiri. (Okay, let me calculate this.)

The doll costs the price of three figurines, so the doll costs $5 x 3 = $15.

A red car costs $4, and there are five of them, so the total value of the red cars is $4 x 5 = $20.

The total value of the toys is the sum of the values of the doll and the red cars, which is $15 + $20 = $35.

He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Zaid earns $6,000 a month. He spends a quarter of it on rent, which is $1,500. A third of it on fuel, which is $2,000. So, he has $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500 left.

He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $1,250. Now, he has $2,500 - $1,250 = $1,250 left.

He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. So, he has $1,250 - $200 - $700 = $350 left.

The winner got 3/4 of the votes, which is 0.75. Multiply 0.75 by 80 to get 60 votes. The winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, subtract 60 from 80. 80 - 60 = 20. The loser got 20 votes. Ngiyabonga!
181	Sandra, the local florist, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She had also ordered 200 calla roses, five times the amount of white carnations. Sandra threatened to change suppliers if the missing red roses were not delivered by 5 p.m. To keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver by 5 p.m.?	160	"Mzuri sana! (Very good!) Let's solve this problem. Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Then, the number of red roses is 4x.

She also ordered 200 calla roses, which is 5 times the amount of white carnations. So, 5x = 200. To find x, we can divide both sides by 5: x = 200/5 = 40.

Now we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered 4 times as many red roses, she ordered 4(40) = 160 red roses.

But Fred only delivered some of the red roses. Let's call the number of red roses he delivered ""y"". Since Sandra threatened to change suppliers if the missing red roses weren't delivered by 5 p.m., we know Fred has to deliver all the missing red roses.

The number of missing red roses is 160 - y. Since Sandra ordered 160 red roses in total, Fred has to deliver 160 - y red roses by 5 p.m. to keep Sandra as a customer.

Mzuri sana!"

Probability of getting a number greater than 3: 3/6 = 50%

Probability of getting an even number twice in a row: 2/6 × 2/6 = 4/36 = 11.11%

So, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row is: 100% - 11.11% = 88.89%

186	Russell works in a pet store and distributes straw to the rodents. The rats are divided into 3 cages in groups of equal size and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamster cages. Each of them is alone in his cage and gets 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where we distribute 20 pieces of straw. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw were distributed to the small rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?	5	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba wena ukuthi unengingi. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking.) 

To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters). We know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 160 pieces of straw in total. So, the number of rats is:

160 ÷ 6 = 26.67 (but we can't have a fraction of a rat, so let's round down to 26 rats)

There are 10 hamster cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of hamsters is:

160 - (26 rats × 6 pieces of straw per rat) = 160 - 156 = 4

Now, let's add the number of rats and hamsters to get the total number of small rodents:

26 rats + 4 hamsters = 30

The rats are divided into 3 cages of equal size. To find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3:

26 rats ÷ 3 = 8.67 (but we can't have a fraction of a rat, so let's round down to 8 rats per cage)

Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuba wena ukuthi unengingi. (Goodbye! Thank you for asking.)"
187	Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed to a 2% monthly interest, so if Mandy is able to pay that amount in three months, how much does she owe Benedict?	106	Mfana, Benedict akhona $100 + ($100 x 0.02 x 2) + ($100 x 0.02 x 3) = $100 + $4 + $6 = $110.
188	A merchant buys a few sacks of wheat from a farmer at $20 a sack. Knowing that transporting a sack from the farm to the warehouse costs $2 and that all the sacks were sold at $30 a sack for a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of each sack: $20
Transportation cost per sack: $2
Total cost per sack: $20 + $2 = $22

Since the merchant sold all the sacks for a total profit of $400, let's set up an equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
Total revenue = Total cost + Profit

We know the total profit is $400, so:

Total revenue = Total cost + $400

Since the merchant sold each sack for $30, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of sacks × $30

Now, we can set up an equation:

Number of sacks × $30 = $22 × Number of sacks + $400

Simplifying the equation:

30x = 22x + 400

Subtracting 22x from both sides:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 50

So, the merchant sold 50 sacks!"
189	Three friends spent $20.25 on three entrance tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than they spent on the tickets. They also did two rides at $33 each. If they agreed to split the cost equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Tickets: $20.25 ÷ 3 = $6.75 each
Food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 ÷ 3 = $5.25 each
Rides: $33 x 2 = $66 ÷ 3 = $22 each
Total: $6.75 + $5.25 + $22 = $34
Total ÷ 3: $34 ÷ 3 = $11.33 each"

To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs a day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) and then multiply by 10 (since there are 10 ducks).

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day
0.5 pounds/day × 10 ducks = 5 pounds/day

193	Sue lives in a neighborhood where there is a good mood. During one weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on her. On Friday morning, they placed 18 plastic flamingos in her garden. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back a third of the flamingos they had painted white and placed them in Sue's garden. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic flamingos were there than white flamingos?	24	"Mfana, ngikubonga! (Hello, my friend! I'm happy to help you with that!)

Okay, let's break it down:

Initially, there were 18 plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, a third of the flamingos (which is 18 / 3 = 6) were taken away and painted white. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos left.

On Sunday, 18 more flamingos were added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 flamingos.

At noon on Sunday, there were 30 flamingos in total. Of those, 6 were white flamingos (since a third of the original 18 were taken away and painted white).

So, to find out how many more plastic flamingos there were than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the total:

30 (total flamingos) - 6 (white flamingos) = 24

Mfana, ngikubonga! (My friend, I'm done! There were 24 more plastic flamingos than white flamingos!)"

If each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots needed is:

40 restaurants x 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

We have 200 pounds of carrots, but we only need 80 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount needed from the total amount:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."

Finally, during the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have?	320	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Elaine started with 20 cards. She collected 3 times as many in the first month, so 3 x 20 = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than the first month, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the total of the first two months, so 2 x (20 + 60) = 2 x 80 = 160 cards. Adding all together, 20 + 60 + 40 + 160 = 280 cards. Ngiyabonga!
199	Marc is a proofreader. He proofreads the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him at a different rate. Publisher B pays Marc twice as much as Publisher A. Marc edits a total of 1,000 sentences per week, while Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Marc make in a week, in cents?	7500	Wena ukuthula! Marc makes 5 cents per sentence for Publisher A, and 10 cents per sentence for Publisher B, since Publisher B pays twice as much. Since Marc edits a total of 1,000 sentences per week, he makes 5 cents x 500 sentences + 10 cents x 500 sentences = 2,500 cents + 5,000 cents = 7,500 cents.

201	John receives a prize at work. This prize consists of a one-time bonus of $5,000 and a salary increase of 5 percent. If he earns $2,000 a week, every week of the year, and he received the prize on the first day of the year, how much money did he earn that year?	114,200	"Ndi ndi! (I'll answer!) 

John earns $2,000 per week. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, John earns:

$2,000 per week x 52 weeks per year = $104,000 per year

He receives a one-time bonus of $5,000. So, his total earnings for the year are:

$104,000 per year + $5,000 bonus = $109,000 per year

He also receives a 5% salary increase. To calculate this, multiply his original salary by 0.05:

$104,000 per year x 0.05 = $5,200 per year

Add this to his total earnings:

$109,000 per year + $5,200 per year = $114,200 per year

So, John earns $114,200 in that year."

If, on the first five tests, Brinley got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score does she need to get on the sixth test to get an average of 93?	98	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) 

To find the lowest score, we need to add all the scores and then subtract the total from 5 times 93. 

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

438 - 465 = 27

211	Jerry has a chicken farm. Red chickens produce three eggs a day, and white chickens produce five eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than there are red ones, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a nice question!)

Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since there are two more white chickens than red ones, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3x.

White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10.

The total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + (5x + 10) = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens!"

Ku-ntathu abantu abamili (One third of the penguins) went to swim in the ocean, and ku-ntathu abantu abamili (One third of the penguins) went to eat dinner in the cave. That's a total of ku-ntathu abantu abamili + ku-ntathu abantu abamili = 2/3 of the penguins.

36 - 2/3 = 12

So, ku-ntathu abantu abamili (One third of the penguins) = 12 penguins continued to sunbathe."

236	Ram uses many pens. He discovered that he could save money by mixing the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens that he uses to make new pens when the ink runs out, how many pens will he get in total?	31	Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) Ram uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, for 25 pens, he will get 25/5 = 5 full pens. Ram will have 25 empty pens + 5 full pens = 30 pens. Ndiyakuthandala!
237	Johnny took his allowance of $20, to which he added $10. He then invested that amount, which tripled in one year. How much money did he have at the end of one year?	90	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Johnny had $20 + $10 = $30. After tripling, he had $30 x 3 = $90.

239	The building has three entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. If, after a meeting, 30 percent of the students leave the building through exit A, 3/5 through exit B, and the rest through exit C, calculate the number of students who left the building through exit C.	280	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm going to answer!)

If 30% of the students left through exit A, that means 30 out of every 100 students left through exit A.

If 3/5 of the students left through exit B, that means 60 out of every 100 students left through exit B.

The remaining students left through exit C. Since 100% - 30% - 60% = 10%, it means 10 out of every 100 students left through exit C.

So, if there are 100 students, 30 left through exit A, 60 left through exit B, and 10 left through exit C. To find the number of students who left through exit C, we multiply 10% by the total number of students:

10% of 100 = 10

So, 10 students left the building through exit C. Ndiyakwenda!"
240	Jack has six more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does he have than Jack?	21	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many as Robert. So Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies. Jack has 6 more candies than Robert, so Jack has 27 + 6 = 33 candies. John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than Jack. Ngiyabonga!
241	Dolly has two books. Pandora has only one. If Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, how many books will they have read in total by the end?	6	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Dolly has 2 books and reads 3 books (her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book). Pandora has 1 book and reads 3 books (her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books). In total, they will have read 3 + 3 = 6 books."
242	Mike corresponded with five people and then stopped corresponding with two of them. The others each send two five-page letters every week. He answers them the same way. If he can write a page every six minutes, how many hours does he spend writing a week?	3	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)

243	Jason has a phone plan of 1,000 minutes a month. Every day, he communicates with his boss for 15 minutes, and this month, he spent an additional 300 minutes calling other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	Kwaku, Jason na 1,000 minutes a month. Ebetwee, odi yɛnkyɛnkyɛ 15 minutes a day with his boss, so 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. Odi yɛnkyɛnkyɛ 300 minutes calling other people. So Jason has 1,000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes left.
244	Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle had. If, in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	Hamba kahle! Griffin had 24 fries initially. Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 5 x 2 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, making it 9 + x = 27. So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 9 = 18 fries.
245	There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in another. The difference between the quantities of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?	7	"Wena, ngicela ukuthi kubalulele! (Let me think for a moment!) 

Okay, so the difference between the snails is 32 - 4 = 28. And this difference is equal to twice the sum of the fish. So, if we call the number of fish in each aquarium ""x"", we can set up the equation:

2x = 28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium!"
246	Jeanne's makeup artist charges her $250 an hour. She needs very expensive makeup for a movie she's starring in and it takes her six hours a day. She has to do it four times a week.

She split the cost in three, between herself and her two parents. How much did each person pay?	32	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

She split the cost with herself and her two parents, so they each paid:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32 per person."
248	A chef bought four bags of onions at 50 pounds each. If a pound of onions costs $1.50, how much did he spend?	300	"Kwaku, wɔn ɛnnyɛ sɛ ɛnnyɛ! (Ah, my friend, let me calculate!) 

The chef bought 4 bags of onions at 50 pounds each. So, the total number of pounds is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. 

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 pounds x $1.50 per pound = $300. 

Kwaku, ɛnnyɛ yɛn! (Ah, my friend, that's the answer!)"
249	On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Monday and ate 13 the next day. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did her sister Sue consume?	5,600	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies. Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 x 200 = 9200. Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 x 200 = 3600.

Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories."
