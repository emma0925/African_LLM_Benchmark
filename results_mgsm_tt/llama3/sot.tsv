4	Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of chicken food, with nuts, algae, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She gives the chickens three different meals. In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of food. In the evening, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to feed her chickens for the last time if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Mfana, Wendi inyoka kwa njalo! (Friend, Wendi needs to know this!)

For each meal, Wendi gives 3 cups of food per chicken. Since she has 20 chickens, she needs 3 x 20 = 60 cups of food per meal.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of food, which is 15/60 = 1/4 of the total food needed for one meal.

In the evening, she gives 25 cups of food, which is 25/60 = 5/12 of the total food needed for one meal.

So, for the last meal, Wendi needs to give 60 - (15 + 25) = 60 - 40 = 20 cups of food.

Mfana, Wendi inyoka! (Friend, Wendi knows!)"
5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her apartment. A glass is $5, but each second glass is only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much do you need to pay for them?	64	"Sawubona! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (Hello! How are you?)

Ngicela ukuthula, ngicela ukuthula... (Let me calculate, let me calculate...)

First 8 glasses are $5 each, so that's $40.
Next 8 glasses are 60% of $5, which is $3 each, so that's $24.

Total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

Ngicela ukuthula, ngicela ukuthula... (Let me calculate, let me calculate...)

Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

Ngiyabonga ukuthi unjani? (How are you?)"

7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Usually she can download 2 GB per minute, but 40% of the download is complete. Windows forces a restart to update, which takes 20 minutes. Now Carla has to start the download from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) Okay, let's calculate...

Carla has already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 0.4 x 200 GB = 80 GB.

She still needs to download 200 - 80 = 120 GB.

She can download 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.

But, she has to restart the download after the 20-minute update. So, she will need to add 20 minutes to the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Ndiyakuthandile! (I like it!) It will take Carla 80 minutes to download the file."
8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph and turns back when he realizes that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends 2 hours in stopped traffic. He spends another half hour driving at 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 mph. How far is he home after 4 hours?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

He turns back and spends 2 hours in stopped traffic, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 2 x 0 + 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles.

He spends the remaining 4 hours at 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 4 x 80 = 320 miles.

In total, he covers a distance of 180 + 15 + 320 = 515 miles."
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works in a week is $10. She also earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza has worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?	460	"Ndi mwezi! (That's correct!) 

Eliza's salary for the first 40 hours is 40 x $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she earns 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 x $10 = $12 per hour. She worked 5 overtime hours, so she earns 5 x $12 = $60.

Total salary is $400 + $60 = $460."
10	The new app had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many total downloads did the app have in three months?	366	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Igama eli: Izindlela zokudlwana kwindlela. (The question is: Total downloads in three months.)

Izindlela zokudlwana kwindlela: 60 + 3 x 60 - 30% x 3 x 60 = 60 + 180 - 54 = 186.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastries. She bought 3 tins of doughnuts for $68 each. 2 tins of cupcakes for $80 each, and 6 tins of cheesecakes for $55 each. What was the total price?	694	"Ko si kekere! (That's a lot of money!)

3 tins of doughnuts for $68 each = 3 x $68 = $204
2 tins of cupcakes for $80 each = 2 x $80 = $160
6 tins of cheesecakes for $55 each = 6 x $55 = $330

Total price = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694"
12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will produce seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each. It costs $3 a year to plant and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Ndi ndi! (That's the answer!)

Carlos akan kuenda nke 7 lemons, na 7 lemons akan kuenda $10.50. $10.50 akan kuenda $3, Carlos akan kuenda $7.50. Carlos akan kuenda $7.50, Carlos akan kuenda $90. Carlos akan kuenda 12 years. (Carlos will make $7.50, Carlos will make $90. Carlos will make it in 12 years.)"
13	Melanie is a traveling saleswoman. She sold her third vacuum to the green house, two more to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. If Melanie has any vacuums left, how many did she start with?	18	Ndi mboni! (I understand!) Melanie sold 3 vacuums to the green house, 2 to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. So, 3 + 2 = 5 vacuums were sold. If she sold half of what was left, that means she had 10 vacuums initially.
14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining 25% are enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest are enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) In this case, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, and 25% are enrolled in jazz dance. That means 20% + 25% = 45% are enrolled in either contemporary or jazz dance. Since there are 20 students total, 45% of 20 is 9 students. That means 20 - 9 = 11 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, divide 11 by 20 and multiply by 100: (11 ÷ 20) x 100 = 55%. Therefore, 55% of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. Ndiyakuthanda! (I love you!)
15	The seller wants to make a choice between 2 purchase strategies: jewelry priced at $5,000 or electrical appliances priced at $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while electrical appliances will go up 1.2% that month. If the seller wants to make a total profit at the end of the month by making a choice, what will this profit be?	125	"Moo nkhondo! (Let's do the math!)

If the seller chooses jewelry, the price will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is $125. So, the new price will be $5,125. The profit will be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

If the seller chooses electrical appliances, the price will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is $96. So, the new price will be $8,096. The profit will be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

Moo nkhondo! (That's the answer!) The seller will make a profit of $125 if they choose jewelry and $96 if they choose electrical appliances."
16	Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. Both start westbound, traveling 80 miles. The next day, they head northbound, traveling 150 miles. How far did each train travel in two days?	230	"Nǐ siku! (That's a good question!)

In two days, each train traveled a total distance of 80 miles (westbound) + 150 miles (northbound) = 230 miles.

So, the answer is: 230 miles!"

Kwa hiyo, kasi ya jumla yake ni 1.25 miles kwa dakika 1. Kwa kuwa anahitaji kasi ya 4 miles kwa dakika 1, anahitaji kasi ya 3.25 miles kwa dakika 1 kwa umbali wa 4 miles, na kasi ya 0.75 miles kwa dakika 1 kwa umbali wa 2 miles.
20	I have 10 gallons of orange juice two thirds of water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice one third of water. But when I pour it, I'm pouring out one gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?	15	Hamba kahle! (Farewell!)
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born six years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23. If Samantha is 31 now, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Ndiyakuthandeka! (I'm happy to help!)

Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born six years before her. So, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago the son was born, subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

37 - 23 = 14

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. Ndiyakuthandeka!"
22	Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy one DVD per customer. His next 2 customers buy two DVDs per customer. His last 3 customers don't buy DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?	7	Moo nkhondo! (That's the answer!) Billy sold 5 DVDs on Tuesday.

25	Marie bought a $12 chicken feed, 5 milk packs for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizzas. Marie hid $50 in total. If each box costs $8.50, how many boxes of pizzas did Marie buy?	2	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!)

Marie bought:

* Chicken feed: $12
* 5 milk packs: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie hid $50 in total. So, she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on boxes of pizzas.

Each box costs $8.50, so Marie bought:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes

Ndiyakuthandala! (I understand!) Marie bought 2 boxes of pizzas."
26	Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of long skirts, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $10. A pair of long skirts costs $10. A pair of trousers costs $10.

Cynthia yena yena yena yena yena yena yena! (Cynthia will pay $80.00!)"
28	Henry stops twice on his 60-mile bike trip. The first time he stops after 20 miles, the second time he stops 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?	25	Sabi, Henry stopped after 20 miles, and the second time he stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip. That means the second stop is at 60 - 15 = 45 miles. So, he traveled 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his first and second stops.
29	Gloria buys shoes when she meets a pair of boots that fit her shoe size. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high-heeled shoes that each cost five dollars less than the boots.

30	If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, add Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, and we add Allen's age 10 years from now, the answer is 172.
31	Gunter tries to count the sweets in the container. He asks his friends how many they think are in the container. One says 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What are their estimates?	80	"Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!)

* The first friend says 80.
* The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 40 (since 80/2 = 40). So, the second friend says 40 + 20 = 60.
* The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 10 (since 80/2 = 40 and 10% of 40 is 4, so 25% is 4 x 2 = 8). So, the third friend says 40 + 8 = 48.

Ndiyo, ngwana! (Yes, my child!)"
32	John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes 5 hours a day to walk and run their business. How many hours does it take to take care of dogs a week?	35	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ukuba John angiyaziwa 10 idogi, kwaye kwaye idogi ngiyaziwa 5 hour a day ukuba ngiyaziwa ngiyaziwa. Ukuba John angiyaziwa idogi 7 days a week, ngiyaziwa 10 idogi x 5 hour a day = 50 hour a day. Ukuba John angiyaziwa idogi 7 days a week, ngiyaziwa 50 hour a day x 7 days = 350 hour a week. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. There are still 4 yogurts on sale for $5. How much do you spend on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Ah, Terry loves yogurts, doesn't he?

Let's calculate the cost of yogurts for 30 days:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

The 4 yogurts on sale for $5 means 1 yogurt costs $5 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

So, the total cost of yogurts for 30 days is 60 yogurts x $1.25 per yogurt = $75.

Kulula, Terry! (All right, Terry!)"
37	John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has a set of 13 Legos and sold them for $15 each. He ended up buying 8 video games for $20 each and was left with $5. How many sets of Legos does he still have?	2	Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!) Okay, let's do the math. John sold 13 Legos for $15 each, so he got 13 x 15 = $195. He then bought 8 video games for $20 each, so that's 8 x 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, he spent $195 - $160 = $35 on the video games. Since each Lego was sold for $15, he must have had 35 ÷ 15 = 2 sets of Legos left. Ndiyakuthandile! (I like that!)
38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs for 3 hours the first day and a half as he runs for 2 days. How fast does he run?	10	"Kojo! (That's ""answer"" in Yoruba)

John runs 60 miles in 3 days. To find out how many miles he runs per day, we divide 60 by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20 miles per day

John runs for 3 hours the first day and a half. To find out how many miles he runs in 3 hours, we multiply 20 miles per day by 1.5 days:

20 miles/day × 1.5 days = 30 miles

So, John runs 30 miles in 3 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide 30 miles by 3 hours:

30 miles ÷ 3 hours = 10 miles per hour

Kojo! John runs 10 miles per hour."
39	A person can run at a pace that is four times faster than walking, but he can jump at a pace that is half as fast as running. If he jumps at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can he travel in six hours if he spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?	18	Mfana, ukuthula kwakho kuyinto ekuqaleni.

41	The giant dragon, Perg, was sitting atop Mount Farbo, blazing fire on everything from a distance of 1,000 feet. Polly could throw a golden javelin, the only known weapon that can cut a dragon, from a distance of 400 feet, well into the dragon's flames. But if Polly held sapphire stones, she could throw the javelin three times farther than if she held stones. If she held stones, how far would Polly be able to stop the dragon's flames and keep hitting the dragon with the golden javelin?	200	Ndi ndi! (I understand!) Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet while holding stones. If she held sapphire stones, she could throw it three times farther, which is 3 x 400 = 1200 feet.
42	Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the breakfast lunch. She slices each pie into 8 pieces and puts five pies on the table for the guests to enjoy. At the end of the night, after the guests took and ate the pie pieces, there were 14 pie pieces left. How many pie pieces were taken by the guests?	26	Wena ukuthula! (How are you?) Ah, math problem! Okay, let's solve it. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces. That's 5 x 8 = 40 pie pieces. She put 5 pies on the table, which is 5 x 8 = 40 pieces. At the end, 14 pieces were left. So, the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pie pieces. Wena ukuthula! (How are you?)

46	Candice put the sticky notes in her purse before going to her job at the coffee shop. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a pack of sticky notes. At work, she put one sticky note in every 220 different cups of coffee. If she had 23 sticky notes left, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?	163	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Ngicela ukuthandaza isikhathi. (Let me calculate for a moment.) Candice had 23 sticky notes left, and she put one in every 220 cups of coffee. That means she used 220 sticky notes. She must have had 220 + 23 sticky notes in the pack. 220 + 23 = 243. Ngicela ukuthola! (I've got it!) Candice bought 243 sticky notes.
47	John buys twice as many red tiles as blue tiles. Red tiles cost 50% more than blue tiles. He spends $200 on blue tiles that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the tiles?	800	"Ndi ndi! (Ahah! Let me calculate!)

Since John buys twice as many red tiles as blue tiles, the number of blue tiles is x, and the number of red tiles is 2x.

The cost of blue tiles is $40 each, so the total cost of blue tiles is $40x.

Since red tiles cost 50% more than blue tiles, the cost of red tiles is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

The total cost of red tiles is $60x.

The total amount spent on tiles is $200, which is the cost of blue tiles plus the cost of red tiles. So, we can set up the equation:

$40x + $60x = $200

Combine like terms:

$100x = $200

Divide both sides by 100:

x = 2

So, John bought 2 blue tiles and 4 red tiles.

The total cost of blue tiles is $40x = $40(2) = $80.

The total cost of red tiles is $60x = $60(4) = $240.

The total amount spent on tiles is $80 + $240 = $320.

Ndi ndi! (Ahah! The answer is $320!)"
48	Tracy used a 4-foot - long piece of wire to support the tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into 6-centimeter - long pieces. How many pieces did she find?	8	Ndiyo, Tracy alikua na wire lenye urefu wa 4 feet. Kwa kuwa 1 foot = 30.48 cm, wire hilo lilikuwa na urefu wa 4 x 30.48 = 121.92 cm. Wire hilo lilikuwa na urefu wa 121.92 cm, na kila piece ilikuwa na urefu wa 6 cm. Kwa hiyo, Tracy alikua na wire 121.92 ÷ 6 = 20.32 pieces. Ndio, Tracy alikua na wire 20 pieces.

52	Uriah's book bag swells up to him. He needs to remove 15 kilograms of it. His comic books weigh 1/4 of a pound and his toys weigh 1/2 kilogram of each toy. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?	15	"Ndiyo, Uriah anafanya kazi! (Yes, Uriah is working!)

Let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed: 30 comic books x 0.25 kg (1/4 pound) = 7.5 kg

Uriah needs to remove 15 kg in total. So, the remaining weight of the book bag is: 15 kg - 7.5 kg = 7.5 kg

Each toy weighs 0.5 kg. To find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

7.5 kg ÷ 0.5 kg = 15 toys

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
53	The repairman charges different prices to repair truck and automobile tires. For each truck tire repaired, the repairman will charge $60 and for each automobile tire repaired, the repairman will charge $40. On Thursday, the repairman repaired 6 truck tires and 4 automobile tires. On Friday, the repairman repaired 12 automobile tires and did not repair the truck tires. How much additional profit did the repairman make with the higher profit?	40	"Oya! Ndi na-akwa ukwu! (I understand! Let me calculate!)

On Thursday, the repairman made a profit of:
6 truck tires x $60 = $360
4 automobile tires x $40 = $160
Total profit on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the repairman made a profit of:
12 automobile tires x $40 = $480

Additional profit made on Friday compared to Thursday: $480 - $160 = $320

Oya! Ndi na-akwa ukwu! (I understand! The repairman made an additional profit of $320!)"

How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?	83	Moo ntsa, ke tona 317 boxes.
58	Stephen made a food order online. His last debt was $40.00. Because this was through the delivery person, they added 25% of the total amount and called it $3,000 shipping fee. Stephen also added a $4.00 knife. After the extra money, what was the cost of Stephen's food?	57	"Wena ukuthula! (How are you?) Ah, Stephen's food bill! Let's calculate, shall we?

First, the food order amount is unknown, but we know the shipping fee is 25% of the total. The shipping fee is $3,000, so the total food order amount is:

$3,000 (shipping fee) ÷ 0.25 (25% as a decimal) = $12,000 (total food order amount)

Now, add the knife cost:

$12,000 (total food order amount) + $4 (knife cost) = $12,004

Stephen's last debt was $40.00, so subtract that from the total:

$12,004 (total food order amount + knife cost) - $40 (last debt) = $11,964

Wena ukuthula! (How are you?) Stephen's food bill is $11,964!"

Ukubwa wa kawaida wa ukubwa wa maktaba ya pili ni 16 / 2 = 8. Ukubwa wa kawaida wa ukubwa wa maktaba ya tatu ni 8 / 2 = 4. Ukubwa wa kawaida wa ukubwa wa maktaba ya mwisho ni 4 / 2 = 2. Ukubwa wa kawaida wa ukubwa wa ukubwa wa maktaba ni (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5. Ndio, ukubwa wa kawaida wa ukubwa wa ukubwa wa maktaba ni 7.5.
76	Cecilia has just bought a puppy. According to the vet, she should feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food this season for the first 180 days. Then she should feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food regularly for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food has 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Nǐn hǎo! (Hello!) 

Kuumba! (Let me calculate!) 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia will need in the first 180 days. She will need 1 cup per day for 180 days, so that's 180 cups.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia will need for the rest of the year. Since the puppy will need 2 cups per day, and there are 365 days in a year, that's 730 cups.

Now, let's add the number of cups needed for the first 180 days to the number of cups needed for the rest of the year. That's 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Finally, let's divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per bag (110 cups). That's 910 cups ÷ 110 cups per bag = 8.27 bags.

So, Cecilia will need approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year."

85	Gene sews a bedspread from an old T-shirt. He has one T-shirt from his previous trip. Each T-shirt is a block of his own bedspread. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of the trip. He travels four times a year and has been on trips since he was 23. He is now 34 years old. How many blocks of bedspreads does he have in total?	44	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Gene has been traveling for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11). He travels 4 times a year, so he has 11 x 4 = 44 trips. Each trip gives him one block, so he has 44 blocks.
86	Greg has an alarm that rings three times a day as a memorial. When the alarm rings, it keeps ringing until Greg turns it off. The first time it rings today, it rings four times. The second time it rings, it rings three times longer than the first time it rings. The third time, it rings half as long as the second time. How many times has the alarm ringed in total?	22	"Kulani! (That's ""Answer"" in Swahili!)

Let's break it down:

1st time: 4 rings
2nd time: 4 + 3 = 7 rings
3rd time: 7 / 2 = 3.5 rings (but we can't have a fraction of a ring, so let's round down to 3 rings)

Total rings: 4 + 7 + 3 = 14 rings

Kwa heri! (That's ""Goodbye"" in Swahili!)"
87	The firm pays each of its employees R600 per month.

Since 1/4 of the guests will not come, that means 16 x 1/4 = 4 guests will not attend. So, Christina will have 16 - 4 = 12 guests attending. Each guest needs 75 gift bags, so Christina will need 12 x 75 = 900 gift bags. Gift bags cost $2 each, so the total cost will be 900 x 2 = 1800 dollars."
90	Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to a dinosaur picnic. Do you know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a baby will eat half of what an adult eats? If there are going to be 20 adults and 5 toddlers at the picnic, how many kilograms of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?	225	"Oya! (Ahaha!) Ndi na-ahụ maka! (I understand!)

Adult dinosaurs will eat 10 lbs each, and toddlers will eat half of that, which is 5 lbs each. For 20 adults, that's 20 x 10 = 200 lbs. For 5 toddlers, that's 5 x 5 = 25 lbs. In total, 200 + 25 = 225 lbs. To convert lbs to kg, we multiply by 0.45 (since 1 lb is approximately 0.45 kg). So, 225 lbs x 0.45 = 101.25 kg. Ted needs to bring at least 101.25 kg of potato salad to the picnic!"
91	Jan has three times as many animals as Marcia. Marcia has two more than Cindy. If Cindy has four animals, how many animals do the three of them have?	28	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

98	Cars lined up in a traffic lane. Some cars pass for 15 minutes in traffic, then another 20 cars pass for the remaining 15 minutes of traffic. 5 cars from the line now exit without needing to pass through traffic. If there were 30 cars in the traffic lane, how many cars passed through traffic in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Wena ukuhlonipha! (I'll help you understand!)

Let's break it down:

Total cars in the traffic lane = 30
Cars that pass in the first 15 minutes + Cars that pass in the remaining 15 minutes = Total cars that passed through traffic

We know that 5 cars exit without passing through traffic, so we subtract those from the total:

30 - 5 = 25 cars that passed through traffic

We also know that 20 cars pass through traffic in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that pass through traffic in the first 15 minutes is:

25 - 20 = 5 cars

Wena ukuhlonipha! (I hope that helps!)"

100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many sounds did the doorbell make?	175	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the number of times the doorbell was pressed:

1. First friend: 20 times
2. Second friend: 20 + (1/4) × 20 = 25 times
3. Third friend: 60 + 10 = 70 times
4. Fourth friend: 60 times

Adding all the times, we get: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

Ndiyabonga! The doorbell made 175 sounds."

On Wednesday, he watches several episodes of a 30-minute program. On Thursday, he finishes his work early and watches a one-hour and 30-minute episode of the program. On Friday, he had to stay late for the weekend, so he watches two one-hour episodes. If he watches 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Hamba kahle! Ndiyakuthanda ukuthula ngoku. (Goodbye! I love to chat.)

Let's break it down:

Monday: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Tuesday: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Total: 120 minutes

Wednesday: several episodes of a 30-minute program = x episodes
Thursday: 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes
Friday: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Total: 120 + 90 + x minutes

Total TV time = 7 hours = 420 minutes

Now, let's add up the minutes:
120 + 90 + x = 420
210 + x = 420
x = 210 - 210
x = 0

Oh no! Frankie didn't watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday! He must have watched other types of programs."
108	Henry bakes cakes for a baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he has baked 15 more cakes than he wanted. He breaks his 5 cakes when he puts them in the oven, and now he has a total of 110 cakes. How many cakes did Henry bake last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!) Let's solve this problem together. 

Let's say Henry baked x cakes last year. He wants to make twice as many this year, so he wants to make 2x cakes. But, he made 15 more cakes than he wanted, so he actually made 2x + 15 cakes.

He also broke 5 cakes, so he has a total of 2x + 15 - 5 cakes. This is equal to 110 cakes, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cakes last year."

115	Sasha notices that the price of the lumber has gone up by 50% in the last few months after she bought some more. Since she has some left over, she decides to sell them. She has ten leftover 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4x4x10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?	90	Moo maa, Sasha e ke leboga! (Good job, Sasha!) Let's calculate the profit. She has 10 boards that cost $10 each, so she paid $100 for them. She has 5 boards that cost $16 each, so she paid $80 for them. In total, she paid $180. Now, she sells them for the current price: 10 boards x $15 each = $150, and 5 boards x $24 each = $120. She sells them for $270. Her profit is $270 - $180 = $90. Moo maa, Sasha e ke leboga! (Good job, Sasha!) She makes a profit of $90.

On the first day, 2 shipments of 5 vehicles each were counted, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles. On the second day, 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were delivered. Since each shipment contains 5 vehicles, the number of shipments delivered on the second day is 20 ÷ 5 = 4."
119	Adrien's total income was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. After four years, her income went up, and she was earning 40 percent more than she had four years earlier. If Adrien and Lylah's income went up at the same time, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years earlier, count the total income they both earned four years later?	95200	Moo nna, Adrien's income was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Lylah's income was $30,000 four years earlier. After four years, Lylah's income increased by 40%, so her new income was $30,000 + (40% of $30,000) = $42,000. Adrien's income was $40,000 four years earlier, and increased by 30%, so his new income was $40,000 + (30% of $40,000) = $52,000. Together, they earned $42,000 + $52,000 = $94,000.

124	Jennie helps in her mother's office. She has a collection of unstamped letters, and a collection of stamped letters. She stamps a third of the unstamped letters. If there are 30 letters in a collection of stamped letters, how many were there in the collection when Jennie started?	10	"Nǐn yòu yīng gèi wǒ jiě! (You want me to solve it!)

Let's say the number of unstamped letters is x. Since Jennie stamps a third of the unstamped letters, she stamps x/3 letters.

After stamping, the number of unstamped letters becomes x - x/3 = 2x/3.

We know that the number of stamped letters is 30. This is the sum of the number of stamped letters Jennie had initially and the number of letters she stamped.

So, we can set up the equation:

30 = x - x/3 + x/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 2x/3

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

90 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 45

So, there were 45 unstamped letters initially.

And since Jennie stamps a third of the unstamped letters, she stamps 15 letters (45/3 = 15).

The number of stamped letters Jennie had initially is 30 - 15 = 15.

So, the total number of letters Jennie had initially is 45 (unstamped) + 15 (stamped) = 60.

Ukuba yabonga i-12 izinto eziphakathi, ngoku yabonga i-4 izinto eziphakathi ku-ndoda yena. (Let's calculate! Julia had 12 bowls, but she used 3, and her husband brought 5 more. So she must have had 4 bowls in the pack she bought.)"
126	Dylan needed chicken and fish sausages to make the sausage buns for the party. He bought 38 more chicken and 6 more fish sausages than chicken. How many sausages did Dylan buy?	82	Ndiyakuthanda! (I like that!) Okay, let's solve the problem. If Dylan bought 38 more fish sausages than chicken, that means he bought x + 38 fish sausages, where x is the number of chicken sausages. The total number of sausages is the sum of the chicken and fish sausages: x + (x + 38). We know that the total number of sausages is 38 + 6 = 44 more than the number of chicken sausages, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 38) = x + 44. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 38 = x + 44. Subtracting x from both sides gives us x + 38 = 44. Subtracting 38 from both sides gives us x = 6. So Dylan bought 6 chicken sausages and 6 + 38 = 44 fish sausages. Ndiyakuthanda! (I like that!)
127	After attending a new school, Amy had 20 more friends than Lily had. If Lily had 50 friends, how many friends did Lily and Amy have together?	120	Ndiyo, Amy had 70 friends. Lily had 50 friends. Together, they had 70 + 50 = 120 friends.
128	Mrs. Well sells pumpkins, peppers, and oranges at the village store. A pumpkin costs three times as much as a pepper. An orange costs less than 5 times as much as a pumpkin. Dillon is called to the store to buy 4 pumpkins, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much will he spend in total if one pepper is $15?	880	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Here's the answer:

A pepper costs $15, so a pumpkin costs 3 x $15 = $45.

An orange costs less than 5 times the cost of a pumpkin, so it costs less than 5 x $45 = $225.

Dillon buys 4 pumpkins, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total cost is:

4 pumpkins = 4 x $45 = $180
20 peppers = 20 x $15 = $300
10 oranges = (less than) $225

Total cost: $180 + $300 + (less than) $225 = $705

Dillon will spend less than $705."
129	The hospital accepts 500 people a day. The patient is seen for 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make?	10000	"Ndi nyalani! (I understand!)

Ku hospital, 500 abantu bafika kwa leri (500 people come in a day). Abantu abafika bafika kwa 24 munthu (people come in for 24 minutes). Dokita bafika ku hospital kwa $150 ku muntu (doctors come to the hospital for $150 per hour), na hospital bafika ku abantu kwa $200 ku muntu (and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour).

Hospital bafika ku profit kwa $200 - $150 = $50 ku muntu (hospital makes a profit of $50 per hour). Ku 500 abantu bafika kwa leri, hospital bafika ku profit kwa $50 ku muntu x 500 = $25,000 ku leri (with 500 people coming in a day, the hospital makes a profit of $25,000 per day).

Ndi ndi! (That's it!)"
130	Nissa employs 60 workers to make themselves into elves in her shop in the village of Santa. A third of the elves retire after the children have washed them, and the remaining 10 elves retire after the children have gone to bed. How many elves are left?	30	Ko si kele kele! (That's the answer!)
131	Joseph's expenses in May were $500. In June, expenses dropped by $60. What were his expenses during those two months?	940	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Expenses in May were $500. In June, expenses dropped by $60, so expenses in June were $500 - $60 = $440. Total expenses for both months were $500 + $440 = $940.
132	Pam and Fred went to the party. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, while Fred rode it 4 times. Afterward, they both decided to ride the luge 2 times. With a $6 ticket, how many tickets did they use that day?	60	Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Pam and Fred used 8 tickets that day. Pam used 2 tickets for the roller coaster and 2 tickets for the luge, making a total of 4 tickets. Fred used 4 tickets for the roller coaster and 2 tickets for the luge, making a total of 6 tickets. In total, they used 4 + 6 = 10 tickets. But each ticket costs $6, so they used 10 / 6 = 8 tickets.
133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles. On Tuesday, he walked six times as many miles as Monday. Monday through Wednesday, he walked 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles, which is 4 x 6 = 24 miles. So, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday. Since he walked 41 miles in total from Monday to Wednesday, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.
134	Tom washes the car 4 times a month. If a car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?	720	Hamba kahle! Tom pays $15 x 4 = $60 per month. Per year, Tom pays $60 x 12 = $720.

Rory baye 2 subu za $7.50 each, 2 bagu za chipsu za $1.50 each, na 2 keki za $1 each. Kulani delivery fee ni 20% ya total payment. Total payment ni $7.50 x 2 + $1.50 x 2 + $1 x 2 = $20. 20% ya $20 ni $4. Kulani delivery fee ni $4. Rory baye giftu ya $5, na kulani balance ni $20 - $4 - $5 = $11.
138	Mark wrote a test yesterday of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today he wrote another test of 100 questions at the same rate. When Mark had 8 hours to finish the first test, and 6 hours to finish the second test, how many questions did he leave unanswered?	105	"Ndiyakuthandala! (I'm happy to help!)

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour. In 8 hours, he completed 5 x 8 = 40 questions. Since there were 75 questions in total, he left unanswered 75 - 40 = 35 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour. In 6 hours, he completed 5 x 6 = 30 questions. Since there were 100 questions in total, he left unanswered 100 - 30 = 70 questions.

Ndiyakuthandala!"
139	In a candy machine, the pink gumballs outnumber the blue ones by 22. If there are 12 gumballs, how many are the pink ones?	70	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I can help you with that. 

Let's say the number of pink gumballs is x. Since the pink gumballs outnumber the blue ones by 22, the number of blue gumballs is x - 22. We know that the total number of gumballs is 12.

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x - 22) = 12

Combine like terms: 2x - 22 = 12

Add 22 to both sides: 2x = 34

Divide both sides by 2: x = 17

So, there are 17 pink gumballs."
140	Of the 20 vehicles rented, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage are semi-automatic?	20	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) I can help you with that. 

I calculate that 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 vehicles are semi-automatic. To find the percentage, I divide 4 by 20 and multiply by 100.

4 ÷ 20 = 0.2
0.2 × 100 = 20%

So, 20% of the vehicles rented are semi-automatic."
141	There are 700 bees in their hive. Worker bees are twice as numerous as honeybees, and honeybees are twice as numerous as queen bees. Where are the worker bees?	400	"Hamba kahle! (That's ""Goodbye"" in Zulu, but I'll answer your question instead!)

If there are 700 bees in total, and worker bees are twice as numerous as honeybees, that means honeybees make up 1/3 of the total bees. So, there are 233 honeybees.

Since worker bees are twice as numerous as honeybees, worker bees make up 2/3 of the total bees. So, there are 466 worker bees.

Now, we know that honeybees are twice as numerous as queen bees. That means queen bees make up 1/6 of the total bees. So, there is only 1 queen bee.

So, the worker bees are... EVERYWHERE! (Just kidding, but they're probably busy collecting nectar and pollen!)"
142	Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. He has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make a week if he worked instead of playing video games?	140	Nǐ yé, Jordan á yé 2 órù a dé, órù 10 dólà. Órù 7 dé, Jordan á yé 7 x 2 = 14 órù, 14 órù x 10 dólà = 140 dólà.

* Lights for $3 (non-food item, 10% tax = $0.30)
* Cups for $3 (non-food item, 10% tax = $0.30)
* Frogfish for $4 (non-food item, 10% tax = $0.40)

Total cost: $2 + $3 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4 = $16.60"

147	Debra checks the hive to see how many bees are entering and exiting each day. She sees 30 bees leaving their hive in the first 6 hours, and sees 1/2 of those returning after 6 hours. She sees more than the previous number leaving after 6 hours. Each bee that has left before returns to the hive after 6 hours. How many bees has Debra seen returning to the hive after 6 hours a day?	75	Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Debra has seen 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours, and half of those returning, which is 30 ÷ 2 = 15 bees. After 6 hours, she sees more bees leaving than before, which means the total number of bees leaving is more than 30. Let's call this number x. Since all bees that left before return, the number of bees returning is also x. We know that the number of bees returning is half the number of bees leaving, so x ÷ 2 = 15. To find x, we multiply both sides by 2, which gives us x = 30. So, the number of bees returning after 6 hours is 30. Ndiyabonga!

150	Steve and Tim decide to see who will be the first to get home from school. Steve lives far away, so he is allowed to use the bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school and can ride 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be standing in the house before the loser finishes the competition?	4	"Nǐnga! (That's not a problem!)

Let's calculate the time it takes Steve to get home:

Distance = 3 miles = 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 1760 feet)
Speed = 440 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 5280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes

Let's calculate the time it takes Tim to get home:

Distance = 2 miles = 3520 feet
Speed = 264 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 3520 feet / 264 feet/minute = 13.33 minutes (round up to 14 minutes)

Since Steve finishes first, the winner will be standing in the house for 12 minutes before the loser finishes the competition."

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack contains 6 cookies. So, Carl buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10. So, Carl pays 60 x $0.10 = $6. Carl pays with a $10 bill, so he gets $4 in change. Ngiyabonga!
153	Dave bought a large packet of chips and ate fourteen of them before a sea turtle stole the packet from his hand. When the sea turtle arrived, it ate half of the chips Dave had eaten. Three penguins chased it away from the food and each penguin ate three chips. Later, a racoon stole 2/3 of the remaining chips. The toad took the last chip, leaving five behind. How many chips were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem together.

First, Dave ate 14 chips. Then, the sea turtle ate half of those, which is 7 chips. So, there were 14 + 7 = 21 chips left.

The three penguins ate 3 chips each, which is 3 x 3 = 9 chips. So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 chips left.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining chips, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 chips. So, there were 12 - 8 = 4 chips left.

Finally, the toad took the last chip, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 chips.

To find the original number of chips, we add 3 to the number of chips left: 3 + 14 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 42 chips.

Ndiyabonga! (Thank you!) The answer is 42 chips."

161	Anakin and Locsin went out to sea today. Anakin has 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin has 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish have they all caught?	32	"Hamba kahle! (Farewell!) Let me calculate the total number of fish for you...

Anakin has:
10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish

Locsin has:
5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses
2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish
Total for Locsin: 5 starfish + 3 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Total fish caught by both: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32 fish!

Hamba kahle!"
162	If a bag of marble costs $20, and the price increases by 20% every second month, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?	92	"Kwaku, maa ase! (That's a big question, my friend!) 

After 36 months, the price will increase by 20% every 6 months. 

20% of $20 is $4, so after 6 months, the price will be $24.

After another 6 months, the price will increase by another 20% of $24, which is $4.80, making the price $28.80.

This pattern continues for the next 24 months, with the price increasing by 20% every 6 months.

After 36 months, the price will be:

$24 * 1.2 = $28.80
$28.80 * 1.2 = $34.56
$34.56 * 1.2 = $41.37
$41.37 * 1.2 = $49.65
$49.65 * 1.2 = $59.38
$59.38 * 1.2 = $71.26

So, after 36 months, the bag of marble will cost approximately $71.26."

173	Jessica is trying to figure out how much she should pay off her debts each month. Her education bills are $300 a month, her credit cards are $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debts, how much does she pay off in a year?	18000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Jessica, ngiyakuthanda ukuthula! (I love helping you!) 

To find out how much Jessica should pay off each month, we need to calculate the total amount of her debts: $300 (education) + $200 (credit cards) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000.

To pay off more than 50% of her debts, she should pay more than $500 (50% of $1000).

Let's calculate how much she should pay each month to pay off more than $500 in a year:

$500 (target amount) ÷ 12 (months) = $41.67 per month

So, Jessica should pay more than $41.67 per month to pay off more than 50% of her debts in a year.

Ngiyabonga, Jessica! (Thank you, Jessica!) I hope this helps you manage your debts!"

181	Sandra, a florist, is not happy with Fred's imperfect order. Sandra had placed an order for 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. She placed an order for 200 pink calla lilies, which were 5 times as many carnations. Sandra has promised to buy from another store if the missing roses are not delivered by 5 p.m. In order not to lose Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver before 5 p.m.?	160	"Sandra, yaa asa abalorin! (Sandra, the florist is not happy!) 

Let's calculate, my friend! 

If Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, and she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are 5 times as many carnations, then she must have ordered:

200 calla lilies ÷ 5 = 40 white carnations

And 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so:

40 white carnations × 4 = 160 red roses

But wait, Sandra wants to know how many red roses Fred must deliver before 5 p.m. to keep her business. Well, let's see...

If Fred delivers at least 160 red roses, that's a good start! But Sandra wants to know the minimum number of red roses Fred must deliver to keep her business. Let's assume Fred has already delivered some red roses, say x. Then, Fred must deliver at least:

160 - x red roses

to keep Sandra's business."

186	Russell works in a pet store, and distributes the hay. The baskets are kept in 3 cages and divided into equal groups, with each crate being given 6 hay bales. There are 10 hamster cages kept alone and each hamster is given 5 hay bales. There is also a rabbit hutch where 20 hay bales are distributed to the rabbits. Hay is not used anywhere in the store. If 160 pieces of hay are divided among these animals, how many baskets are in one hutch?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Hayi, ngisemthetha ukuba ngaye kubaluleka. (Okay, let me calculate.)

Kwathi, ngaye kubaluleka:

* 3 cages, each with 6 hay bales = 3 x 6 = 18 hay bales
* 10 hamster cages, each with 5 hay bales = 10 x 5 = 50 hay bales
* 1 rabbit hutch with 20 hay bales = 20 hay bales

Total hay bales = 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 hay bales

Hayi, ngaye kubaluleka: 160 - 88 = 72 hay bales left for the baskets.

Kwathi, ngaye kubaluleka: 72 hay bales divided by 6 hay bales per crate = 12 crates.

Hayi, ngaye kubaluleka: Ngaye kubaluleka ngaye kubaluleka 3 crates per hutch. (So, there are 12 crates divided by 3 crates per hutch = 4 hutches.)

191	If there are ten ducks, how many insects will they need to eat per day?	5	Wena ukuthula! (Good morning!) According to the experts, ducks need to eat about 10-20% of their body weight in insects daily. Since there are 10 ducks, let's assume an average weight of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) per duck. That's 20 kg (44 lbs) for all 10 ducks. To calculate the daily insect requirement, we multiply 20 kg by 0.15 (15% of body weight). That's approximately 3 kg (6.6 lbs) of insects per day. So, the 10 ducks will need around 3 kg of insects daily. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

195	The cost of a pencil is equal to the cost of a pencil and eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20, an eraser $0.30. How much will 8 pencils cost?	12	Ndiyo, ukweli ni kwamba gharama ya peneli na gharama ya peneli na kushonwa kwa pamoja ni sawa. Peneli ina gharama ya $1.20, kushonwa kwa pamoja ina gharama ya $0.30. Kwa hiyo, gharama ya peneli moja ni $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. Kwa hiyo, gharama ya 8 peneli ni 8 x $1.50 = $12.00.

198	Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards do you have now in total?	320	"Ngiyabonga! Ngikubonga! (Thank you! I understand!)

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 x 20 = 60 cards. So, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, she now has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she had collected in the first and second months, which is 2 x (80 + 40) = 2 x 120 = 240 cards. So, she now has 120 + 240 = 360 cards.

Ngiyabonga! Ngikubonga! (Thank you! I understand!) Elaine now has a total of 360 Pokémon cards!"
199	Mark is a speech editor. He edits the same number of sentences for two different publishers, each of whom pays him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make per week?	7500	"Wena ukuthula! (That's a good question!)

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, Mark earns 5 cents x 1000 sentences = $50 from Publisher A.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, Mark earns 2 x 5 cents x 1000 sentences = $100 from Publisher B.

In total, Mark earns $50 + $100 = $150 per week."

Kwa hesabu, kama kuku weusi wanapika 5 maziwa kwa siku na kuku wakubwa wanapika 3 maziwa kwa siku, kwa hiyo kuku wote wanapika 5 + 3 = 8 maziwa kwa siku. Kwa sababu Jerry anapata 42 maziwa kwa siku, kuku wote ni 42 ÷ 8 = 5.25. Lakini kuku hawezi kuwa na kiwango cha kazi, kwa hiyo Jerry ana kuku wakubwa 5 na kuku weusi 0.25. Lakini kuku weusi zaidi ya kuku wakubwa, kwa hiyo kuku wakubwa ni 4."

216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 with a 10% interest. If you pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will Janeth have left?	220	"Hamba kahle! Ngiyabonga ukuthi unamandla! (Goodbye! Thank you for the question!)

To calculate the total interest, multiply the principal amount ($2,000) by the interest rate (10% = 0.10) and the time (12 months):

$2,000 x 0.10 x 12 = $240

Add the interest to the principal:

$2,000 + $240 = $2,240

Now, calculate the total amount paid:

$165 x 12 = $1,980

Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed:

$2,240 - $1,980 = $260

Janeth will have $260 left after paying $165 a month for 12 months. Hamba kahle!"

Kwa sasa, Harriet ni miaka 21. Adrian ni tatu mara zote ya Harriet, hivyo Adrian ni 21 x 3 = 63 miaka. Zack ni mbili mara zote ya Harriet, hivyo Zack ni 21 x 2 = 42 miaka. Kwa sasa, miaka ijayo baada ya miaka tatu, Adrian atakuwa na miaka 66, Harriet na miaka 24, na Zack na miaka 45. Jumla ya miaka yao ni 66 + 24 + 45 = 135. (Yes, yes! Currently, Harriet is 21 years old. Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 21 x 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so Zack is 21 x 2 = 42 years old. In three years, Adrian will be 66 years old, Harriet will be 24 years old, and Zack will be 45 years old. The total of their ages is 66 + 24 + 45 = 135.)

He decides to add his own food for $3.00, where he can add chips and soda. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses when he pays. How much is he still owed?	9	Ndiyo, Robert alikuwa na gharama ya kwanza ya $6.50, lakini alijaza kwa chumvi kwa $2, cheese kwa $1, avocado kwa $1, na sausages 2 kwa $0.25 kwa kila moja. Hivyo, gharama yake ilikuwa $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.50 = $10.00. Lakini alienda kwa gharama yake mwenyewe ya $3.00. Hivyo, gharama yake ilikuwa $10.00 - $3.00 = $7.00. Lakini aliweka kadi ya gharama ya $5.00. Hivyo, anajifungua kwa gharama ya $7.00 - $5.00 = $2.00.
228	Kalinda is working on a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda can put together 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can put together half of Kalinda's pieces in a minute. How many hours will it take them to put this puzzle together?	1	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Kalinda can put together 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can put together half of Kalinda's pieces in a minute, which is 4/2 = 2 pieces in a minute.

In total, they can put together 4 + 2 = 6 pieces in a minute.

To find the total number of minutes it will take them to put together the 360-piece puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in a minute:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To find the total number of hours, we can divide the total number of minutes by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) It will take them 1 hour to put together the 360-piece puzzle."
229	The pumpkin farm produced 120 young pumpkins. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the pumpkins were ready for harvest, and then she took them home. When she returned after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest, and my mother took them. How many pumpkins were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	"Mfana, ngiyabonga! (My friend, thank you!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 120 young pumpkins.

30% of the pumpkins were ready for harvest, which is 0.3 x 120 = 36 pumpkins. Ashlyn took these 36 pumpkins home.

So, the remaining pumpkins are 120 - 36 = 84 pumpkins.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest, which is 0.75 x 84 = 63 pumpkins. My mother took these 63 pumpkins.

Now, let's find out how many pumpkins were not ready for harvest after two weeks:

There were 84 pumpkins remaining, and 63 were ready for harvest. So, the number of pumpkins not ready for harvest is:

84 - 63 = 21 pumpkins

Mfana, ngiyabonga! (My friend, thank you!)"
230	Mark parks 12 cars for his company. He sells each car for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on cars and $1,000 registration fee for each car. How much money does he charge?	276,000	"Moo siyaya! (I'll answer!)

Mark parks 12 cars, each sold for $20,000. Total revenue is 12 x $20,000 = $240,000.

He pays 10% tax on cars, which is 0.10 x $240,000 = $24,000.

He also pays a $1,000 registration fee for each car, which is 12 x $1,000 = $12,000.

Total cost is $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fee) = $36,000.

Mark's profit is $240,000 (revenue) - $36,000 (cost) = $204,000.

Moo siyaya! (That's the answer!)"
231	Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to pick up shells. On Monday, Kylie gets 5 more shells than Robert, who gets 20. On Tuesday, Kylie gets twice as many shells as she did on Monday. On Tuesday, how many shells does Kylie get?	50	"Kylie, Robert, beach, shells, Monday, Tuesday, math!

Kwaku, Kwaku! (That's ""Okay, okay!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language.)

On Monday, Robert gets 20 shells. Kylie gets 5 more, so she gets 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie gets twice as many shells as she did on Monday. So, she gets 2 x 25 = 50 shells.

Kwaku, Kwaku! (That's ""Okay, okay!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language.)

Kylie gets 50 shells on Tuesday!"
232	Dax went to the farm to pick apples and found that there were half as many insects as ants in the garden. If there were 50 insects, add up the number of ants in the garden.	75	Ndi ndi! (Ahah! Listen!) If there were 50 insects, and there were half as many insects as ants, that means there were twice as many ants as insects. So, if 50 insects is half, then 100 ants is the whole. Add 50 insects to 100 ants, and you get... 150! Ndi ndi! (Ahah! That's it!)
233	Thirty-six penguins are frozen in the sun. A third of them jump into the sea to swim, and another third go into a cave to feed. How many penguins are left in the sun?	12	"Ndiyakwenda! (I'm answering!) 

A third of 36 is 12, so 12 penguins jump into the sea and 12 penguins go into the cave. That leaves 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins still frozen in the sun. 

Ndiyakwenda!"
234	Steve can finish eating more tomatoes and planting his cherry tomatoes. He eats more than his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If the garden produces 3 tomatoes a week, how many gardens does he need?	21	"Mfana, ngumuntu omusha! (My friend, let's do the math!) 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes a week.

Since the garden produces 3 tomatoes a week, Steve needs:

42 (his tomatoes) ÷ 3 (garden tomatoes) = 14 gardens

Mfana, ngumuntu omusha! (My friend, that's the answer!)"
235	There are 20 friends and he wants to make sure that they all get 4 slices. The pizza comes out in 8 slices. How many pizzas does John need to buy?	10	Oooh, ngwana! (Oh dear!)

243	Jason has 1,000 phone minutes a month. Every day he calls his boss for 15 minutes, and he had an extra 300 minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	Ndiyo, Jason ana minute 15 kwa siku 30, hivyo ana minute 15 x 30 = 450 minute. Ana minute 1000, lakini ana minute 450, hivyo ana minute 1000 - 450 = 550 minute.
244	Griffin had 24 chips, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of chips, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer than Kyle's. Since Griffin eventually had 27 chips, how many chips did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ngiyakuthetha! (I understand!)

Griffin had 24 chips initially. Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 chips. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 x 2 = 10 chips. Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 chips left.

Ginger gave Griffin some chips, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer than Kyle's, which is 5 - 3 = 2 chips. Griffin ended up with 27 chips, so the number of chips Ginger gave Griffin is:

27 - 9 - 2 = 16

Ginger gave Griffin 16 chips!"
245	There are 4 turtles in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the number of turtles in two aquariums is twice the number of fish in two aquariums. When these two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish in each aquarium.	7	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

246	Jean's makeup artist charges R250 per hour. She needs expensive makeup for the film she is starring in and it takes 6 hours to do it every day, and she needs to do it 4 times a week. The film will end after 5 weeks. After the film is over, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount for the work done. How much has Jean hidden?	27000	"Wena, ngiyabonga! (Hello, thank you!)

R250 per hour x 6 hours per day = R1500 per day
R1500 per day x 4 days per week = R6000 per week
R6000 per week x 5 weeks = R30 000
10% discount = R30 000 x 0.10 = R3000
R30 000 - R3000 = R27 000

Jean has spent R27 000."
247	Isabelle bought supplies for her younger brother's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on gifts for guests. She divides the money equally between herself and her parents. How many dollars did each person spend?	32	"Ndiyakuthandile! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since she divides the money equally between herself and her parents, each person gets: $96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person (Isabelle and her parents) spent $32."

Uyisemthethweni, ukuba 4 bags of onions ukuba 50 kg each, ukuba 1.50 per kg, ngiyakuthetha ukuba 4 x 50 = 200 kg, 200 kg x 1.50 = 300 USD. (I calculate that the cook spent 300 USD.)"
249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Wena! (Hello!) 

Sue ate 4 times as many cakes as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cakes. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cakes. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cakes. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cakes. The difference is 46 - 18 = 28 cakes. Each cake has 200 calories, so Sue ate 28 x 200 = 5600 calories more than her sister. Wena!"
