The rest, she will sell each day at the farmer's market, at a cost of $2 per new duck egg. How much (in dollars) will she earn each day at the farmer's market?	18	"Answer only. 
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. At any given time, she will eat three at a time and use the other four to make muffins for friends. The rest, she will sell each day at the farmer's market, at a cost of $2 per new duck egg. How much (in dollars) will she earn each day at the farmer's market?

Answer: $48.

Explanation:

* Janet eats 3 eggs at a time, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
* She uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
* She sells 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so she earns $9 x $2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet earns $18 per day at the farmer's market."

2	Josh enters a home improvement business. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 to renovate it. The price of the house has gone up 150 percent. How much profit has he made?	70000	"Answer only. 
Josh enters a home improvement business. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 to renovate it. The price of the house has gone up 150 percent. How much profit has he made?

Answer: $150,000

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the value of the business after Josh invested $50,000 to renovate it:

$80,000 (original price) + $50,000 (renovation cost) = $130,000

Since the price of the house has gone up 150 percent, the new value of the business is:

$130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000

So, Josh has made a profit of:

$195,000 - $80,000 (original price) = $150,000

Therefore, Josh has made a profit of $150,000."

5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all subsequent glasses are worth 60% off. Kylar wants 16 glasses. How much should she pay to buy them?	64	"Answer only. 
Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all subsequent glasses are worth 60% off. Kylar wants 16 glasses. How much should she pay to buy them?

Answer: $36.

Explanation:

1 glass = $5

2 glasses = $5 + $5 = $10 (60% off = $10 - $6 = $4)

3 glasses = $10 + $5 = $15 (60% off = $15 - $9 = $6)

4 glasses = $15 + $5 = $20 (60% off = $20 - $12 = $8)

5 glasses = $20 + $5 = $25 (60% off = $25 - $15 = $10)

6 glasses = $25 + $5 = $30 (60% off = $30 - $18 = $12)

7 glasses = $30 + $5 = $35 (60% off = $35 - $21 = $14)

8 glasses = $35 + $5 = $40 (60% off = $40 - $24 = $16)

9 glasses = $40 + $5 = $45 (60% off = $45 - $27 = $18)

10 glasses = $45 + $5 = $50 (60% off = $50 - $30 = $20)

11 glasses = $50 + $5 = $55 (60% off = $55 - $33 = $22)

12 glasses = $55 + $5 = $60 (60% off = $60 - $36 = $24)

13 glasses = $60 + $5 = $65 (60% off = $65 - $39 = $26)

14 glasses = $65 + $5 = $70 (60% off = $7"
6	Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 suburbs, how many suburbs are Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 suburbs, how many suburbs are Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle?

I'm happy to help! Let's start by looking at the information we have:

1. Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston.
2. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle.

We can start by finding out how many suburbs Toulouse has. If Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston, then Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 suburbs.

Next, we can find out how many suburbs Charleston has. If Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle, then Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 suburbs.

Finally, we can find out how many suburbs Seattle has. If Seattle has 20 suburbs, then Seattle has 20 suburbs.

So, Toulouse has 8 suburbs, Charleston has 80 suburbs, and Seattle has 20 suburbs."

Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, and backtracks when he realizes that he has forgotten something valuable at home. He tries to drive for 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in the traffic jam. In the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph with 4 hours left. How far is it from his home at the end of 4 hours?

Answer: 120 miles

Explanation:

Let's break down Jean's journey into three parts:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

2. The backtracking at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 1 = 30 miles

3. The remaining 4 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance from home + Backtracking distance
= 180 + 30 + 320 = 530 miles

Therefore, Jean will be 530 miles from his home at the end of 4 hours."

12	Carlos wants to plant a Lilala tree. The cost of planting is 90$. per year, the tree can grow from 7 apples which will be sold for 1.5$ each. Watering the tree costs 3$ per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos wants to plant a Lilala tree. The cost of planting is 90$. per year, the tree can grow from 7 apples which will be sold for 1.5$ each. Watering the tree costs 3$ per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree?

Answer: 6 years.

Explanation:

The tree can produce 7 apples per year, and each apple can be sold for $1.50. So, the total income from the tree per year is:

7 apples x $1.50 per apple = $10.50 per year

The cost of planting the tree is $90 per year, so the total cost per year is:

$90 per year (planting cost) + $3 per year (watering cost) = $93 per year

Since the income from the tree is $10.50 per year, and the total cost per year is $93 per year, it will take 6 years for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree:

$10.50 per year (income) - $93 per year (cost) = $0 per year (breakeven point)

Therefore, it will take 6 years for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree."

Melanie works as a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, then sold two to the red house, then finally sold the rest to the orange house. If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?

Answer: Melanie had 15 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.

Explanation:
Let the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning be x.

We know that she sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, so she sold 1/3x vacuum cleaners to the green house.

Then, she sold two vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house.

Finally, she sold the rest of the vacuum cleaners to the orange house, so she sold x - (1/3x + 2) vacuum cleaners to the orange house.

We know that Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, so we can set up the equation:

x - (1/3x + 2) = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Melanie had 15 vacuum cleaners at the beginning."
14	In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?	60	"Answer only. 
In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?

Answer: 40%

Explanation:

Total number of students in the class = 20

Number of students in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 4

Number of students in jazz dance = 25% of 20 = 5

Number of students in hip-hop dance = 20 - (4 + 5) = 20 - 9 = 11

Percentage of hip-hop dance students = 11/20 x 100% = 55%"
15	A trader will be torn between two purchases: $5,000 worth of jewelry or $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets. His financial advisor predicts a 2.5% increase in the market for jewelry and a 1.2% increase in the market for electronic gadgets over the course of a month.

A trader will be torn between two purchases: $5,000 worth of jewelry or $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets. His financial advisor predicts a 2.5% increase in the market for jewelry and a 1.2% increase in the market for electronic gadgets over the course of a month. If the trader chooses the one that will help him maximize profits at the end of the month, what is the interest rate?

Answer: 
The interest rate is 2.5% per month.

Explanation: 
The trader should choose the jewelry, as it is expected to appreciate at a higher rate (2.5%) than the electronic gadgets (1.2%). This means that if the trader purchases $5,000 worth of jewelry, it will be worth $5,000 + (2.5% x $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125 at the end of the month, resulting in a profit of $125.

On the other hand, if the trader purchases $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets, it will be worth $8,000 + (1.2% x $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096 at the end of the month, resulting in a profit of $96.

Therefore, the interest rate is 2.5% per month, as this is the rate at which the jewelry is expected to appreciate."

17	Jill earns $20 an hour as a dance teacher and $30 an hour as a dance teacher for children. If she works 35 hours a week as a dance teacher, 15 hours a week as a dance teacher and 50 hours a week per year, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Answer only. 
Jill earns $20 an hour as a dance teacher and $30 an hour as a dance teacher for children. If she works 35 hours a week as a dance teacher, 15 hours a week as a dance teacher and 50 hours a week per year, what is her annual salary?

Answer:

Jill's annual salary as a dance teacher = 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week

Jill's annual salary as a dance teacher for children = 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week

Total annual salary = $700/week + $450/week = $1,150/week

Therefore, Jill's annual salary = $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year."

19	Marissa has walked the longest distance of 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?	6	"Answer only. 
Marissa has walked the longest distance of 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?

Answer: 3 miles per hour.

Explanation:

To get an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa needs to have a total distance traveled of 4 miles x 2 hours = 8 miles.

Since she has already walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour, she has a total distance traveled of 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

To cover the remaining distance of 8 - 6 = 2 miles, she needs to walk at a speed of 2/1 = 2 miles per hour."

Gunter tries to count the candies in his mouth. He asks his friends to guess the number. One of them answers 80. Another says 20 more than half of the previous one. The third says 25% more than the previous one. What is their average guess?

I can solve this problem using the concept of linear equations. Let's say that the number of candies in Gunter's mouth is x.

The first friend guesses 80, so we can set up the equation:

80 = x

The second friend says that their guess is 20 more than half of the previous one, which is:

20 = (1/2)x

Substituting the value of (1/2)x from the previous equation, we get:

20 = (1/2)80

Solving for x, we get:

x = 160

The third friend says that their guess is 25% more than the previous one, which is:

25% of 160

Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get:

25% of 160 = 25/100 \* 160

Simplifying, we get:

25/100 \* 160 = 40

Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is:

(80 + 20 + 40) / 3 = 140 / 3 = 46.67

So, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 46.67."

33	Gretchen has 110 gold coins. The gold coins are 30 coins more than the silver one. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Answer only. 
Gretchen has 110 gold coins. The gold coins are 30 coins more than the silver one. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Answer: 110

Explanation: Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so if she has x silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins. We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."
34	Siobhan has 2 jewels less than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?	23	"Answer only. 
Siobhan has 2 jewels less than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?

Let's start by letting Raymond have 40 jewels, and Aaron have 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels.

Aaron has 5 more than half of 40, which is:

40 / 2 = 20

So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 jewels less than Aaron, so she has:

25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
35	Mike has been playing ping-pong for 40 minutes. During the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. He scored 25 percent of the extra points over the next 20 minutes. How many points has he scored in total?	9	"Answer only. 
Mike has been playing ping-pong for 40 minutes. During the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. He scored 25 percent of the extra points over the next 20 minutes. How many points has he scored in total?

Answer: 16 points.

Explanation:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored 4/60 = 2/30 points per minute.

In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points, so he scored 2/30 x 1.25 = 2/24 points per minute.

Therefore, Mike scored 2/30 x 24 = 16 points in total."
36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5. How much money is lost on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5. How much money is lost on yogurt in 30 days?

Answer: $15

Explanation:

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so he consumes 60 yogurts in 30 days (2 x 30 = 60).

Since each yogurt costs $4, the total cost of yogurts for Terry in 30 days is:

39	Dana will run four times faster than her normal walking pace, but will run twice as fast as her normal walking pace. If she runs at 3 miles per hour, how many miles has she run in six hours, given that she spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana will run four times faster than her normal walking pace, but will run twice as fast as her normal walking pace. If she runs at 3 miles per hour, how many miles has she run in six hours, given that she spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?

Answer: 2.5 miles

Explanation:

Let D be the distance Dana runs in miles in 1 hour when she runs at her normal pace.

Since she runs four times faster than her normal walking pace, she runs at a speed of 4D miles per hour.

Also, she runs twice as fast as her normal walking pace, so her normal walking pace is D/2 miles per hour.

We know that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, so the time she spends running is 1/3 of 6 hours, or 2 hours.

Therefore, the distance she runs in 2 hours is 2 \* 4D = 8D miles.

Since she runs for 2 hours, the total distance she runs in 6 hours is 8D + 0(D/2) = 8D + D/2 = 9D/2 miles.

Now we can find D:

We know that Dana runs at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so the distance she runs in 1 hour is 3 miles.

Therefore, D = 3 miles.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

9D/2 = 9(3) = 27 miles

So Dana runs 27 miles in 6 hours, given that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking."

Mrs. Jones's grandmother cooked five cookies with apples for the murderers' breakfast. Then she dressed the cookies individually in eight pieces. She spread the cookies on the dining table so that each person could have their own portion. In the evening, after the guests had eaten the cookies, there were 14 left. How many guests ate the cookies?

Hint: Think about the number of pieces each cookie was cut into.

Answer: 8

Explanation:

Mrs. Jones's grandmother cut each cookie into 8 pieces, so there were 8 x 5 = 40 pieces of cookies in total.

In the evening, there were 14 cookies left, which means 40 - 14 = 26 cookies were eaten by the guests.

Since each guest ate one cookie, there were 26 guests in total."

charlie wants to sell some beeswax candles. each pound of beeswax will allow him to make 10 candles. one pound of beeswax PE if it sells for 10,00$. silk a sali PE sold 20 candles, what is his total profit? let's say one candle sold for 2,00$

Answer: 

Charlie sells 20 candles at $2,000 each, so his total revenue is:

20 candles x $2,000 each = $40,000

He used 2 pounds of beeswax to make these candles, so he spent:

2 pounds x $10 per pound = $20

His total cost is:

$20 (cost of beeswax) + $40,000 (revenue) = $40,020

Therefore, Charlie's total profit is:

$40,020 - $20 (cost of beeswax) = $39,990"

Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes articles on health-related topics and sends them to clients every day. An article on her blog takes an average of 4 hours of work, depending on the search to write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times as many articles on Tuesday. Wednesday wrote twice as many articles as if she hadn't written on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the past three days.

Answer: 16 hours.

Explanation:

Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours/article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 5 articles = 10 articles x 4 hours/article = 40 hours
Wednesday: 2 x 10 articles = 20 articles x 4 hours/article = 80 hours
Total hours spent writing articles over the past three days: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent 140 hours writing articles over the past three days, or an average of 16 hours per day (140 hours / 3 days)."

Before going to work at the coffee shop, Candice put 80 pencils in her handbag. On the way, she stopped to buy a packet of pencils at the store. Arriving at work, she left 220 pencils in a coffee cup. If there are 23 pencils left, how many pencils in the packet did she buy?

Let's assume that the packet of pencils had x pencils.

Candice had 80 pencils in her handbag before she bought the packet.

After buying the packet, she had 80 + x pencils in her handbag.

She left 220 pencils in the coffee cup, so the total number of pencils she had was:

80 + x + 220 = 300

Since there are 23 pencils left, we can set up the equation:

80 + x + 220 = 300 - 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 207

So, Candice bought a packet of 207 pencils."

Richard lives in one of the apartments in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 apartments. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, what is the total number of vacant apartments in the building?

I can't use the information that Richard lives in one of the apartments.

Answer: 24

Explanation:

Let X be the number of vacant apartments in the building.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied apartments is 3/4 of 15 floors, or 12 floors.

Each floor has 8 apartments, so the total number of occupied apartments is 12 x 8 = 96.

Since there are 15 floors in total, the number of vacant apartments is 15 - 96 = 24."

Lloyd owns a chicken farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day and he sells them for $2 a dozen. How much does Lloyd make a week from his eggs?

Answer: Lloyd makes $50 a week from his eggs.

How did you get that answer?

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he gets per day by the number of days in a week.

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week

Since each dozen eggs sells for $2, we can calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes in a week by multiplying the number of eggs he sells by the price per dozen:

1,764 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3,528/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $3,528 per week from his eggs."

A jar contains 25 oranges, of which 1 is rotten, 20% is uncooked, 2 are acidic and the rest are good. How many are good oranges?

I'm trying to solve this problem using a system of linear inequalities, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Can you help me?

Kélian cooks with two recipes, one with 20 recipes and the other with twice as many recipes as before. How many recipes does Kélian have to read to cook two meals?

Hint: Think about the number of recipes in each collection and how they relate to each other.

Answer: Kélian has to read 40 recipes to cook two meals.

Explanation:

Let's say the first collection has x recipes. Since Kélian cooks with twice as many recipes as before, the second collection has 2x recipes.

To cook two meals, Kélian needs to read both collections of recipes. Therefore, the total number of recipes Kélian needs to read is x + 2x = 3x.

Since Kélian has to read 3x recipes to cook two meals, we can set up the equation:

3x = 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 13

Therefore, Kélian has 13 recipes in the first collection and 26 recipes in the second collection (since 2x = 26)."

Sheila bought five swimming trunks at a cost of $150 each, to be paid in 3 months. Interest of 2% will be paid on each one. How much does it cost Sheila to be paid in 1 month for 3 months?

Answer:  $45

Explanation: 

The total cost of 5 swimming trunks is $150 x 5 = $750

For 1 month, the cost will be $750 / 3 = $250

For 3 months, the cost will be $250 x 3 = $750

Interest for 1 month at 2% is $750 x 2% = $15

So, the total cost for 1 month for 3 months is $250 + $15 = $45"

77	Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara. PE Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David. last summer Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between the amount of Raymond's laundry and David's laundry	100	"Answer only. 
Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara. PE Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David. last summer Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between the amount of Raymond's laundry and David's laundry

Please help me solve this problem.

Answer: 

David does 4 times as much laundry as Sara.

Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara.

If Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David, then Sara does 4D laundry.

If Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara, then Raymond does 2S laundry.

The problem states that last summer Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between the amount of Raymond's laundry and David's laundry:

400 = 2S - 4D

Solving for S, we get:

S = 2(400) = 800

So Sara does 800 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara, so Raymond does 2(800) = 1600 pounds of laundry.

David does 4 times as much laundry as Sara, so David does 4(800) = 3200 pounds of laundry."

Vicent has to choose between the 3rd pack of flowers for $2.50 or the 2nd pack of flowers for $1. How much money would he save if he bought 18 flowers at the right price?

Answer:

If Vicent buys the 2nd pack of flowers for $1, he would pay $1 x 18 = $18.

If he buys the 3rd pack of flowers for $2.50, he would pay $2.50 x 18 = $45.

Therefore, by buying the 2nd pack of flowers, Vicent would save $45 - $18 = $27."

82	Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than Grace by 4 kilograms. What is, in pounds, the weight of both of them?	623	"Answer only. 
Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than Grace by 4 kilograms. What is, in pounds, the weight of both of them?

I can solve this problem by first converting Alex's weight from kilograms to pounds, then finding the difference in weight between Grace and Alex, and finally adding Grace's weight to that difference to find the total weight of both of them.

Here's how I would solve the problem:

1. Convert Alex's weight from kilograms to pounds:

2 kg x 2.2 lb/kg = 4.4 lb

2. Find the difference in weight between Grace and Alex:

Grace's weight - Alex's weight = 125 lb - 4.4 lb = 120.6 lb

3. Add Grace's weight to the difference to find the total weight of both of them:

120.6 lb + 125 lb = 245.6 lb

Therefore, the weight of both Grace and Alex is approximately 245.6 pounds."

Christian throws a birthday party and asks for $0.75 in gift bags for the guests, only to find that a quarter of the guests don't show up. Knowing that he's invited 16 friends and the gift bags cost $2 each, how much will he spend?

Answer: $4.

Explanation:

16 friends x $2 each = $32

Since 1/4 of the guests didn't show up, the number of guests who did show up is:

16 friends - 1/4 of 16 = 16 friends - 4 = 12 friends

So, Christian will spend $12 x $2 each = $24 on gift bags."

when Freda is cooking a tomato soup PONT uses a tomato soup, the tomato soup is lost in the crowd. she uses 16 tomatoes This contains three tomatoes. the last cooking of Freda's soup helped her get 32 ounces of soup. how many tomatoes did Freda use

Answer: Freda used 19 tomatoes.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given:

1. Freda used 16 tomatoes to make the tomato soup.
2. The tomato soup is lost in the crowd, which means we don't know how much soup Freda got from the 16 tomatoes.
3. The last cooking of Freda's soup helped her get 32 ounces of soup.

Now, let's think about how we can use the information to find out how many tomatoes Freda used. We know that 16 tomatoes were used to make the soup, but we don't know how much soup was made. However, we do know that the last cooking of Freda's soup helped her get 32 ounces of soup.

So, if we divide 32 ounces by the amount of soup that Freda got from 16 tomatoes, we can find out how many tomatoes she used.

Let's divide 32 ounces by 16 tomatoes:

32 ounces ÷ 16 tomatoes = 2 ounces per tomato

Now, we can multiply the number of tomatoes by the number of ounces per tomato to find out how many tomatoes Freda used:

16 tomatoes x 2 ounces per tomato = 32 ounces

Therefore, Freda used 19 tomatoes (16 tomatoes x 2 ounces per tomato = 32 ounces)."

So, 30 - 5 = 25 cars will be left on the road.

25 cars will be able to cross in the first 15 minutes through the traffic jam."

Assuming that the fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times, how many times does the doorbell ring?

I need help with this problem. I'm not sure how to approach it.

Answer:

The first friend rings the doorbell 20 times, so let's call that x.

The second friend rings the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first, so the second friend rings the doorbell 20/4 = 5 times.

The third friend rings the doorbell 10 times as many times as the fourth, so the third friend rings the doorbell 60/10 = 6 times.

In total, the doorbell rings 20 + 5 + 6 = 31 times."

Every night, Frankie watches TV after doing his homework. Since last Tuesday, he watches one hour episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watches more episodes of the 30-minute show. Thursday has finished his homework earlier and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. Friday doesn't go to bed early for Saturday, so he watches two one-hour episodes each. If he watches a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Frankie watches one hour episode of his favorite show every night.
2. On Wednesday, he watches more episodes of the 30-minute show.
3. Thursday finishes his homework earlier and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show.
4. Friday doesn't go to bed early for Saturday, so he watches two one-hour episodes each.
5. Frankie watches a total of 7 hours of television.

Now, let's analyze the information:

* Wednesday: Frankie watches more episodes of the 30-minute show, but we don't know how many.
* Thursday: Frankie watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show, so he watches a total of 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
* Friday: Frankie watches two one-hour episodes each, so he watches a total of 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours.

Adding up all the hours, we get:

1 hour (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 4.5 hours

Since Frankie watches a total of 7 hours of television, we can set up the equation:

4.5 hours = 7 hours

Solving for the variable, we get:

30 minutes = 7 hours

Therefore, Frankie watches 30 minutes on Wednesday."

Henri is baking cookies for the national pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the baking, he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than he should have. He cuts down 5 biscuits during the cooling process and is left with a total of 110 biscuits. How many biscuits did Henri bake last year?

Answer: 
Henri baked 95 biscuits last year.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of biscuits Henri baked last year.

Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he bakes 2x = 2(95) = 190 biscuits this year.

He cuts down 5 biscuits during the cooling process, so he has 190 - 5 = 185 biscuits left.

He wants to make 15 more cookies than he should have, so he has 185 + 15 = 200 biscuits in total.

Therefore, Henri baked 95 biscuits last year."

Katy is cooking coffee using 7 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water in the ratio of 7:13. Do a calculation of how many cups of coffee she has left, knowing that she has used a total of 120 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water.

Answer: 47 cups of coffee left.

Explanation:

Let's denote the number of cups of sugary coffee Katy has used as 'x'.

Since she has used a total of 120 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water, we can write the equation:

x + 1 = 120

Now, we know that Katy has 7 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water, so we can write:

x = 7(13) = 7 \* 13 = 91

Now, we can substitute the value of 'x' in the first equation:

91 + 1 = 120

Solving for 'x', we get:

91 = 119

Therefore, Katy has 47 cups of coffee left (120 - 91 = 47)."

If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased by one hour, and Adrien received $40,000 for four years, calculate the total amount of their salary after four years.	95200	"Answer only. 
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, this salary increased by a whopping 40% from what he started receiving. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased by one hour, and Adrien received $40,000 for four years, calculate the total amount of their salary after four years.

Answer:

Adrien's starting salary was $40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000.
Lylah's starting salary was $52,000 x 0.7 = $36,000.

After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40% of $52,000, which is:

$52,000 x 1.4 = $72,800

Lylah's salary increased by 40% of $36,000, which is:

$36,000 x 1.4 = $48,000

Therefore, Adrien's total salary after four years is $72,800, and Lylah's total salary is $48,000."

121	Morissette was asked by Kael to carry the fruit. Morissette carried 5 apples and 8 oranges, but Kael carried twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morissette. How many fruits did they all carry?	27	"Answer only. 
Morissette was asked by Kael to carry the fruit. Morissette carried 5 apples and 8 oranges, but Kael carried twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morissette. How many fruits did they all carry?

Let's use variables to represent the number of fruits carried by each person. Let x represent the number of apples carried by Morissette, and y represent the number of oranges carried by Morissette.

According to the problem, Kael carried twice as many apples as Morissette, so Kael carried 2x apples. Additionally, Kael carried half as many oranges as Morissette, so Kael carried y/2 oranges.

Let's write an equation to represent the total number of apples carried by all three people:

x + 2x = 3x

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 5x + y/2

Solving for x:

x = (5x + y/2)/3

Now that we have found x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation we wrote earlier:

y = 2x + y/2

Substituting x:

y = 2(5x + y/2) + y/2

Simplifying:

y = 10x + y

Solving for y:

y = (10x + y)/2

Now we have found both x and y, so we can find the total number of apples and oranges carried by each person:

Morissette carried 5x apples and 8y oranges.
Kael carried 2x apples and y/2 oranges.

Can you find the total number of fruits carried by all three people?"

Nissa has hired 60 seasonal players to play the violin in Santa's village in her department store. One third of the violinists quit after the children waved them up, then 10 violinists quit because the children put their feet in the iron. How many violinists are left?

This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The solution is not based on arithmetic, but rather on the creative interpretation of the given information.

Here's the solution:

After one third of the violinists quit, there were 60 x 2/3 = 40 violinists left.

Then, 10 more violinists quit because the children put their feet in the iron. So, the final number of violinists left is 40 - 10 = 30."

134	Tom will do four car washes a month. If a car wash costs $15, how much will he spend in a year?	720	"Answer only. 
Tom will do four car washes a month. If a car wash costs $15, how much will he spend in a year?

I know the answer is $60, but I don't know how to get that answer. Can you please explain?

Answer: $60

To find out how much Tom will spend in a year on car washes, we need to multiply the number of car washes he does per month by the cost of each car wash.

4 car washes per month x $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$60 per month x 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom will spend $720 per year on car washes."

141	There are 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Answer only. 
There are 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

Answer: 490

There are 700 bees in the hive.
There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees.

Let's say there are x baby bees and queen bees.
Then, there are 2x worker bees.

We know that the total number of bees is 700.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 700

Simplify the equation:

3x = 700

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 233

So, there are 233 baby bees and queen bees.

And, there are 2 times as many worker bees, which is:

233 x 2 = 466

There are 466 worker bees."

2. The gull stole the packet and ate half of the remaining French fries, which is half of 16 = 8 French fries.
3. The three pigeons ate three French fries each, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 French fries in total.
4. The rabbit stole the remaining two-thirds of the French fries, which is two-thirds of 16 = 10 French fries.
5. The ants ate the last one, leaving five French fries.

Therefore, there were 30 French fries in the packet when Dave bought it."

One pool is 17 feet deep on Monday. On Tuesday, the pool is 7 feet deeper. Wednesday's water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. How deep is the pool on Wednesday?

Answer: 10 feet.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given:

1. On Monday, the pool is 17 feet deep.
2. On Tuesday, the pool is 7 feet deeper, so it is 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.
3. On Wednesday, the pool is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday, so it is 24 x 2/3 = 16 feet deep.

Therefore, the pool is 10 feet deep on Wednesday."
161	Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippos and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 hippos less than Anakin and 2 clownfish more than Anakin. How many fish did they both catch?	32	"Answer only. 
Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippos and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 hippos less than Anakin and 2 clownfish more than Anakin. How many fish did they both catch?

Please help me with this problem. I'm having a hard time understanding how to solve it.

Thank you!

I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how you can solve it:

Let's start by looking at the information we know:

* Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippos, and 3 clownfish.
* Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 hippos less than Anakin, and 2 clownfish more than Anakin.

We can start by finding out how many starfish Locsin caught. Since she caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, she caught:

5 = 10 - 5

So Locsin caught 5 starfish.

Next, we can find out how many hippos Locsin caught. She caught 3 hippos less than Anakin, so she caught:

3 = 6 - 3

So Locsin caught 3 hippos.

Finally, we can find out how many clownfish Locsin caught. She caught 2 clownfish more than Anakin, so she caught:

2 = 3 + 2

So Locsin caught 2 clownfish.

Now that we know how many fish each of them caught, we can add up all their catches to find out how many fish they both caught:

10 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 20

So Anakin and Locsin caught a total of 20 fish.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
162	If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?

Answer: $14,000.

Explanation:

The starting price of a bag of bills is $20.

After 2 days, the price increases by 20%, so the new price is:

$20 x 1.20 = $24

After another 2 days, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is:

$24 x 1.20 = $28.80

After another 2 days, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is:

$28.80 x 1.20 = $34.56

After 36 months (3 years), the price of a bag of bills is $34.56."

Jackie is wondering if she should file her own taxes or hire an accountant. By doing so, she could work 3 hours as a freelancer per month, which would mean a loss of $35 per hour. The accountant would charge her $90. How much more would she make if she hired someone?

Answer:

To determine how much more Jackie would make if she hired an accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring an accountant from the amount she would lose by working as a freelancer.

Let's first calculate the amount she would lose by working as a freelancer:

3 hours/month x $35/hour = $105/month

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring an accountant:

$105/month - $90 = $15/month

Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she would make an additional $15 per month."

Jake is walking through the entomology museum. He sees 80 eight-legged spiders, 90 six-legged insects, and 3 ten-legged mutant invertebrates. How many legs does Jake see in all?

Answer: 930.

To find the total number of legs, we need to add up the number of legs for each group:

80 eight-legged spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 legs
90 six-legged insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 legs
3 ten-legged mutant invertebrates x 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs

Adding all these numbers together gives us a total of 930 legs."

Jessica is wondering how much she should pay each month to pay off all of her debts. The minimum student loan payment is $300 per month, the credit card payment is $200 per month and the mortgage payment is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much should she pay per year?

Answer: $11,700 per year. 

To calculate this, first calculate the total of all the minimum payments:

$300 x 12 = $3,600
$200 x 12 = $2,400
$500 x 12 = $6,000
Total minimum payments = $12,000

To pay 50% more than the minimum, Jessica should pay:

$12,000 x 1.5 = $18,000

So, Jessica should pay $18,000 per year to pay off all of her debts."

Billy is grinding and cutting a banana to make a banana salad for the big family barbecue. Since it's a big deal, he has 60 banana to grill. The bananas are roughly the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to grind and cut. It takes Billy one and a half minutes to grind a banana, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How many hours does it take Billy to finish cooking the banana?

Answer: 2 hours.

To find out how many hours Billy takes to finish cooking the bananas, we need to first find out how many minutes he takes to grind and cut all the bananas.

There are 60 bananas, and it takes Billy one and a half minutes to grind each banana, so he will take:

60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes

to grind all the bananas.

It takes him only 5 seconds to cut each banana, so he will take:

60 x 5 = 300 seconds

to cut all the bananas.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time it takes to cut the bananas to hours:

300 seconds / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Therefore, it will take Billy a total of:

90 minutes + 0.5 hours = 2 hours

to finish cooking the bananas."
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on ice cream and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on ice cream?	15	"Answer only. 
Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on ice cream and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on ice cream?

Answer: $15

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Juan and Carlos spend $3 on ice cream for every gallon of lemonade.
2. They spend $2 on sugar for every gallon of lemonade.
3. They sell 20 glasses of lemonade at $0.50 each.
4. They make a profit of $25.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on ice cream. We know that they sell 20 glasses of lemonade, so they must have made 20 gallons of lemonade (since each glass contains 0.5 gallons of lemonade).

We also know that they spend $3 on ice cream for every gallon of lemonade, so they spend $3 x 20 = $60 on ice cream in total.

Additionally, we know that they spend $2 on sugar for every gallon of lemonade, so they spend $2 x 20 = $40 on sugar in total.

Now, let's calculate their total expenses:

Total expenses = $60 (ice cream) + $40 (sugar) = $100

Since they make a profit of $25, their total revenue must be:

Total revenue = Total expenses + Profit
= $100 + $25
= $125

So, Juan and Carlos spent $100 on ice cream and sugar, and made a profit of $25."

Zaid spends 1/4 of his rent, 1/3 for his car fuel and gives the rest of the money to charity. He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly meals and $700 to his wife for household food. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending and donating?

Answer:

After paying rent, car fuel, charity, and giving money to his family, Zaid will have $1,600 left.

Explanation:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
3. Charity: $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500
4. Giving money to his family: $200 + $700 = $900

Total expenses: $1,500 + $2,000 + $2,500 + $900 = $6,900

Total income: $6,000

Jerry divided the result of the game of six. What is the probability (in percent) of getting a number that is greater than 3 instead of the number One divided by two twice in a row?

I understand that this is a probability question, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Can you please provide some guidance on how to solve this problem?

Thank you!

I'm happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to first understand what Jerry is doing. He is dividing the result of a game of six, which means he is dividing a number by 6.

To find the probability of getting a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of getting a number that is not equal to 1 or 2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry divides the result of the game of six.
2. He gets a number, let's say x.
3. He divides x by 6.
4. The result of the division is either a whole number or a fraction.
5. If the result is a whole number, it must be greater than 3.
6. If the result is a fraction, it must have a numerator greater than 3.

Now, let's find the probability of getting a number greater than 3. There are 6 possible outcomes when dividing a number by 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Of these 6 outcomes, only 3 (3, 4, and 5) are greater than 3. So, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is:

3/6 = 0.5

Therefore, the probability of getting a number that is greater than 3 instead of the number one divided by two twice in a row is 0.5 or 50%.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

Russell works in the organ house and divides the grass into organs. The mice divide the 3 parts of the house into a set of equal size and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. There is also a rabbit yard where they divide 20 parts of grass. No grass is used outside the store. If 160 parts of grass are divided into smaller parts, how many mice are in each house?

There are 10 houses of hamsters, and one of them is alone in his house, so there are 9 houses of hamsters in total.

Each mouse gets 6 parts of grass, so there are 9 x 6 = 54 parts of grass divided among the mice.

There are 20 parts of grass in the rabbit yard, so there are 20 - 54 = 34 parts of grass left over.

Since there are 160 parts of grass in total, we can set up the following equation:

9 x 6 + 20 = 160

Solving for the number of mice in each house, we get:

9 x 6 = 54

20 = 160 - 54

There are 54 mice in each house."

191	bats need 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects do you need per day to survive a pack of ten bats?	5	"Answer only. 
bats need 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects do you need per day to survive a pack of ten bats?

Answer: 

To determine how many pounds of insects are needed per day to survive a pack of ten bats, we need to divide the total weekly requirement of 3.5 pounds by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day

Therefore, you would need 0.5 pounds (or 250 grams) of insects per day to survive a pack of ten bats."
192	Tom plants 10 seeds a year. He cuts PE 2 seeds a year. He starts with 50 seeds. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead. How many seeds are left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 seeds a year. He cuts PE 2 seeds a year. He starts with 50 seeds. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead. How many seeds are left?

Answer: 32 seeds.

Explanation:

1. At the start, Tom has 50 seeds.
2. Each year, he plants 10 seeds and cuts 2 seeds, so he has:

50 - 10 + 2 = 48 seeds

3. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead, so he has:

48 x 0.7 = 33.6 seeds

Rounding down to the nearest whole number gives 32 seeds."
193	Sue lives in a neighborhood where it's beautiful. One Saturday, the neighbors decide to make a joke of her. Friday morning, they put 18 plastic pink flamingos in her garden. Saturday morning, the neighbors remove one-third of the pink flamingos and paint them white and put them back in Sue's garden. Also Sunday morning, 18 plastic pink flamingos were added to the menu. At noon on Sunday, how much more plastic pink flamingos were there than white flamingos?	24	"Answer only. 
Sue lives in a neighborhood where it's beautiful. One Saturday, the neighbors decide to make a joke of her. Friday morning, they put 18 plastic pink flamingos in her garden. Saturday morning, the neighbors remove one-third of the pink flamingos and paint them white and put them back in Sue's garden. Also Sunday morning, 18 plastic pink flamingos were added to the menu. At noon on Sunday, how much more plastic pink flamingos were there than white flamingos?

The question is asking for the number of plastic pink flamingos that were added to the menu on Sunday, not the number of white flamingos.

So, to find the answer, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the total number of plastic pink flamingos.

Let's break down the information we have:

1. On Saturday morning, there were 18 plastic pink flamingos in Sue's garden.
2. One-third of the pink flamingos were painted white and put back in Sue's garden.
3. On Sunday morning, there were 18 plastic pink flamingos in Sue's garden, plus 18 more that were added to the menu.

So, to find the total number of plastic pink flamingos on Sunday, we need to add the number of pink flamingos on Saturday to the number of pink flamingos added to the menu:

18 (pink flamingos on Saturday) + 18 (pink flamingos added to the menu) = 36

Now, let's subtract the number of white flamingos from the total number of plastic pink flamingos:

36 (total plastic pink flamingos) - 12 (white flamingos) = 24

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more plastic pink flamingos than white flamingos in Sue's garden."

195	One pencil costs One pencil and PE glue combined. if a pencil costs 1.20$ PE glue 0.30$ , what is the cost of 8 pencils?	12	"Answer only. 
One pencil costs One pencil and PE glue combined. if a pencil costs 1.20$ PE glue 0.30$ , what is the cost of 8 pencils?

The question asks for the cost of 8 pencils, so we need to find out how much 8 pencils would cost in total.

If one pencil costs $1.20, then 8 pencils would cost 8 x $1.20 = $9.60.

If PE glue costs $0.30 per unit, then 8 pencils would cost $9.60 + $0.30 x 8 = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00.

Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is $12.00."

200 pounds of carrots should be distributed to 40 restaurants in Fulani Town. If each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 18 pounds.

Explanation:

200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 2 pounds per restaurant

2 pounds x 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

120 pounds - 2 pounds = 118 pounds

Therefore, 118 pounds of carrots will not be used."

In the beginning, Elain had 20 pokemon cards. He collected three times as many by the end of the month. In the middle of February, he collected 20 cards less than he collected in the first month. In the middle of March, he collected twice as many cards as he collected in the first two months. How many pokemon cards does he have now?

Answer: 60 pokemon cards.

Explanation:

* In the first month, Elain collected 20 pokemon cards.
* In the second month, he collected 3 times as many cards, so he collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
* In the middle of February, he collected 20 cards less than he collected in the first month, so he collected 20 - 20 = 0 cards.
* In the middle of March, he collected twice as many cards as he collected in the first two months, so he collected 2 x (20 + 60) = 2 x 80 = 160 cards.

Therefore, Elain has a total of 160 - 0 = 160 pokemon cards."

Janet has 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pencils and 2 bags of red pencils. There were 9 bags of blue pencils and 6 bags of red pencils. How many pencils does Janet have now?

Answer: 38 pencils.

Explanation:

Janet had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pencils.

Then she bought 6 bags of blue pencils, and each bag contained 9 pencils, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pencils.

She also bought 2 bags of red pencils, and each bag contained 6 pencils, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pencils.

In total, Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = 38 pencils."

Brinkley is in Mr. Bert's math class. He administers six exams per week. He allows students to eliminate bad grades in the semester. If, during the first five exams, Brinkley scored the following 89, 71, 100 and 86 points, what would he need to score in the sixth exam to get 93 points overall?

Please show your calculations.

I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how you can approach it:

Let's say Brinkley scores x points on the sixth exam.

We know that he has already scored 89, 71, 100, and 86 points on the first five exams, so we can add up those scores to get his total score so far:

89 + 71 + 100 + 86 = 366

Since Brinkley is allowed to eliminate one bad grade, we know that he can drop his lowest score. In this case, the lowest score is 71, so we'll subtract that from his total score:

366 - 71 = 305

Now, we need to find out what score Brinkley needs on the sixth exam to get a total score of 93. To do this, we can subtract 305 from 93:

93 - 305 = -212

Since we can't have a negative score, we know that Brinkley needs to score at least 212 points on the sixth exam to get a total score of 93.

So, the minimum score Brinkley needs on the sixth exam is 212."

Twenty-two dozen cups are worth $1,200 minus the total value of half a dozen players sold at $600 each. Calculate the price of one cup.

Answer: $36

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the total value of half a dozen players sold at $600 each:

6 players x $600 = $3,600

Now, we subtract the total value of half a dozen players from the total value of twenty-two dozen cups:

$1,200 - $3,600 = -$2,400

Since the result is negative, we know that the price of one cup is less than $600.

To find the price of one cup, we can divide the total value of twenty-two dozen cups by the number of cups:

$1,200 / 22 = $36

Therefore, the price of one cup is $36."

Sara wants to buy a new pair of shoes. The shoes she chooses are priced at 30$. A pair of sandals is 20$. Sara takes care of the neighbor's children 4 times. She gets 5$ at a time. Her parents give her 4$ each time. Who cuts the lawn. If Sara has already saved 10$ before starting to work as a babysitter, how many times does she have to cut the lawn before she can buy sandals?

Please help me with this problem. Thank you!

I can help you with that! Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

1. First, we know that Sara has already saved 10$ before starting to work as a babysitter. So, let's subtract 10$ from the amount she needs to buy the sandals:

30$ - 10$ = 20$

Now, we know that Sara needs to earn 20$ to buy the sandals.

2. Next, we know that Sara gets paid 5$ each time she takes care of the neighbor's children. So, if she takes care of them 4 times, she will earn:

4 x 5$ = 20$

Great, she has earned enough to buy the sandals!

3. However, we also know that her parents give her 4$ each time. So, we need to subtract that amount from what she earned:

20$ - 4$ = 16$

Now, we know that Sara has 16$ left after taking care of the neighbor's children and getting paid by her parents.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many times Sara needs to cut the lawn to earn the remaining amount she needs to buy the sandals. We know that she gets paid 5$ each time she cuts the lawn:

16$ / 5$ = 3

So, Sara needs to cut the lawn 3 times to earn enough to buy the sandals.

I hope this helps you understand the solution to the problem! Let me know if you have any other questions."

215	Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320,000 and a belt for $32.00 if her part-time job earns her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can buy the one she wants?	44	"Answer only. 
Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320,000 and a belt for $32.00 if her part-time job earns her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can buy the one she wants?

Answer: 40 hours

Explanation:

To find out how many hours Lori has to work to buy the shoes, we need to divide the cost of the shoes by her hourly wage:

$320,000 ÷ $8.00/hour = 40 hours

So, Lori has to work for 40 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes.

To find out how many hours she has to work to buy the belt, we can divide the cost of the belt by her hourly wage:

$32.00 ÷ $8.00/hour = 4 hours

So, Lori has to work for 4 hours to earn enough money to buy the belt."
216	Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back at a 10% interest rate. If she had to pay $165 a month, how much money would Janet have left?	220	"Answer only. 
Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back at a 10% interest rate. If she had to pay $165 a month, how much money would Janet have left?

Answer: $1,835

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the total amount of interest paid over the course of the loan:

Total interest = Principal x Rate x Time
Total interest = $2,000 x 10% x 12 months
Total interest = $2,000 x 0.10 x 12
Total interest = $240

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid each month:

Total monthly payment = Principal + Interest
Total monthly payment = $2,000 + $240
Total monthly payment = $2,240

Now, let's calculate how much money Janet will have left after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each:

Balance remaining = Principal - (Total monthly payment x Number of payments)
Balance remaining = $2,000 - ($2,240 x 12)
Balance remaining = $2,000 - $2,788
Balance remaining = $1,835

Therefore, after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each, Janet will have $1,835 left."

It takes Carmen 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete the southwest grid. During the week, she has completed 3 crossword puzzles and 8 southwest grids. How many hours does she spend playing these games?

Answer: 2 hours and 35 minutes.

Explanation:

To find out how many hours Carmen spends playing these games, we need to add up the time she spends on each activity.

3 crossword puzzles x 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes
8 southwest grids x 5 minutes per grid = 40 minutes

Adding these two amounts gives us a total of 70 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the total number of minutes by 60 to find the number of hours:

70 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour and 10 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spends 1 hour and 10 minutes playing these games during the week."

226	James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 human, 20 grass and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass, what is the percentage chance (matching the adjacent value) that the randomly selected card is water?	33	"Answer only. 
James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 human, 20 grass and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass, what is the percentage chance (matching the adjacent value) that the randomly selected card is water?

Please explain your answer.

Answer: 20%

Explanation:

After losing 8 water cards, James has 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.

If he buys 14 grass cards, he will have 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total.

The percentage chance that a randomly selected card is water is:

(32 / 46) x 100% = 20%

This is because there are 32 water cards out of a total of 46 cards."

The watermelon garden has produced 120 watermelon chicks. Ashley goes to the garden after two months and finds that 30 percent of the watermelon is ripe for harvesting and chooses to bring it to her. On her return, after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelon is ripe for harvesting. How many watermelons are not ripe for harvesting after two weeks?

Answer:

Let's use ""W"" to represent the number of watermelons that are not ripe for harvesting after two weeks.

We know that 30% of the watermelon is ripe for harvesting after two months, so the number of ripe watermelons is:

30% of 120 = 0.3 x 120 = 36

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe for harvesting, so the number of unripe watermelons is:

4/4 x 96 = 4 x 96 = 384

Subtracting the number of ripe watermelons from the number of unripe watermelons gives us the number of watermelons not ripe for harvesting after two weeks:

384 - 36 = 348

Therefore, there are 348 watermelons not ripe for harvesting after two weeks."

231	Kylie and Robert like to go to the beach to eat shellfish. On Monday, Kylie ate 5 more shellfish than Robert ate for her, out of 20 shellfish. On Tuesday, Kylie ate 2 more shellfish than Robert ate for her. How many shellfish did Kylie eat on Tuesday?	50	"Answer only. 
Kylie and Robert like to go to the beach to eat shellfish. On Monday, Kylie ate 5 more shellfish than Robert ate for her, out of 20 shellfish. On Tuesday, Kylie ate 2 more shellfish than Robert ate for her. How many shellfish did Kylie eat on Tuesday?

Answer: 13

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Kylie ate 5 more shellfish than Robert ate for her on Monday, so Kylie ate 20 - 5 = 15 shellfish on Monday.
* On Tuesday, Kylie ate 2 more shellfish than Robert ate for her.

We don't know how many shellfish Robert ate for Kylie on Tuesday, so let's call that x. Then, Kylie ate x + 2 shellfish on Tuesday.

We know that Kylie ate 15 shellfish on Monday, so the total number of shellfish Kylie ate in two days is 15 + (x + 2) = 15 + x + 2.

We want to find out how many shellfish Kylie ate on Tuesday, so we can set up an equation:

15 + x + 2 = 13

Solving for x, we get:

x = 13 - 15 = 2

So Kylie ate 2 shellfish on Monday and 13 - 2 = 11 shellfish on Tuesday."

233	There are 36 penguins bathing in the sun and snow. A third of them are diving and swimming in the sea. Another third will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches. How many penguins continue to bathe in the sun?	12	"Answer only. 
There are 36 penguins bathing in the sun and snow. A third of them are diving and swimming in the sea. Another third will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches. How many penguins continue to bathe in the sun?

Answer: 12 penguins continue to bathe in the sun.

Explanation:
Let x be the number of penguins bathing in the sun.

We know that 1/3 of the penguins are diving and swimming in the sea, so 36/3 = 12 penguins are diving and swimming in the sea.

We also know that another 1/3 of the penguins will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches, so 36/3 = 12 penguins will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches.

So, x + 12 + 12 = 36, where x is the number of penguins bathing in the sun.

Solving for x, we get x = 12, so 12 penguins continue to bathe in the sun."

240	Jack has 6 more marbles than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54, how many more marbles does he have than Jack?	21	"Answer only. 
Jack has 6 more marbles than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54, how many more marbles does he have than Jack?

Let Robert have x marbles.

Jack has 6 more marbles than Robert, so Jack has x + 6 marbles.

John has twice as many marbles as Robert, so John has 2x marbles.

If John has 54 marbles, then:

x + 6 + 2x = 54

Combine like terms:

3x + 6 = 54

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So Robert has 16 marbles, Jack has 16 + 6 = 22 marbles, and John has 2x = 2(16) = 32 marbles.

Therefore, John has 32 - 22 = 10 more marbles than Jack."

Mike used to be a correspondent for 5 people and then moved on to be a correspondent for 2 people. Others will send 2 5-page letters to one person every week. He will reply to them in the same way. If he can write a speech in 6 minutes, how many hours will he spend writing in a week?

Mike is writing 2 speeches per week, each of which takes 6 minutes to write.

Therefore, the total time he spends writing speeches per week is:

2 speeches x 6 minutes/speech = 12 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of hours Mike spends writing speeches per week as follows:

12 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 0.2 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends 0.2 hours (or 12 minutes) writing speeches per week."

Griffin had 24 fries but Kyle has 5. Billy has twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries, then Colby gets from Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle got. If, in the end, Griffin has 27 fries, how many fries does Ginger give Griffin?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Griffin has 24 fries.
2. Kyle has 5 fries.
3. Billy has twice as many fries as Kyle.
4. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries.
5. Colby gets 3 fewer fries than Kyle got.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many fries Ginger gives Griffin.

We know that Griffin has 24 fries, and Kyle has 5 fries. So, if Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries, Ginger will give Griffin 12 fries (since 12 is half of 24).

But wait, we also know that Colby gets 3 fewer fries than Kyle got. So, if Kyle got 5 fries, Colby will get 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now, let's add up all the fries we know about:

Griffin has 24 fries + 12 fries from Ginger = 36 fries.
Kyle has 5 fries + 2 fries from Colby = 7 fries.
Billy has twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy has 2 x 7 = 14 fries.
Colby has 2 fries.

Adding up all the fries, we get:

36 + 7 + 14 + 2 = 69 fries.

So, Ginger gives Griffin 12 fries."
245	There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?

Let's denote the number of fish in the first aquarium as x.

According to the problem, the number of carcasses in the first aquarium is 4.

The number of carcasses in the second aquarium is 32.

The difference between the number of carcasses in the two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in the two aquariums.

So, we can write:

4 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

4 = 2x - 8

Solving for x:

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in the first aquarium and 32 - 4 = 28 fish in the second aquarium."

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble understanding how to approach it.

Thank you!

Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and use the information given to find the total calories eaten by Sue's sister.

Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. Sue ate five biscuits on Monday, and each biscuit has 200 calories. So, Sue ate a total of 5 x 200 = 1000 calories on Monday.
2. On the second day, Sue ate two goats. We don't know the caloric value of goats, so we'll ignore this information for now.
3. Sue's sister ate four biscuits on the first day, and each biscuit has 200 calories. So, Sue's sister ate a total of 4 x 200 = 800 calories on the first day.
4. On the second day, Sue's sister ate thirteen biscuits. We know that each biscuit has 200 calories, so we can calculate the total calories eaten by Sue's sister on the second day as follows:

13 x 200 = 2600 calories

Now, let's add the total calories eaten by Sue and her sister to find the total calories consumed:

1000 + 800 + 2600 = 4400 calories

Therefore, Sue's sister ate a total of 4400 calories."
