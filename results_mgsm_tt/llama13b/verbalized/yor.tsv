Janet's chickens hatch 16 eggs a day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and she cuts the brownies for her friends down to four a day. She sells the rest at the farmer's market daily for $2 for a chicken egg. Who loses a dollar a day at the farmer's market?

Answer: Janet.

Explanation: If Janet sells 16 eggs at $2 each, she would earn $32 per day. However, if she eats three eggs for breakfast and cuts the brownies to four, she is left with only 13 eggs to sell. Therefore, she loses $2 per day, which is $1 per egg, at the farmer's market."	1

2	Josh decided to try home improvement. He bought a house for $80,000 and renovated it for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Answer only. 
Josh decided to try home improvement. He bought a house for $80,000 and renovated it for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

Answer: $75,000.

Explanation:

New value of the house = $80,000 + ($50,000 / 150%)
New value of the house = $80,000 + $33,333
New value of the house = $113,333

Profit = New value - Original value
Profit = $113,333 - $80,000
Profit = $75,000"	75000

7	Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can actually download 2 GB/second, but 40% of the time, Windows is forced to restart to update, which takes about 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the file from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Answer only. 
Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can actually download 2 GB/second, but 40% of the time, Windows is forced to restart to update, which takes about 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the file from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?

Answer: 30 minutes.

Explanation:

1. Download speed = 2 GB/second
2. Time taken to download 200 GB = 200 GB / 2 GB/second = 100 seconds
3. Time taken to restart Windows and restart the download = 20 minutes = 1200 seconds (40% of the time)
4. Total time taken to download the file = 100 seconds + 1200 seconds = 1300 seconds
5. Therefore, it will take 30 minutes to download the file."	30

A startup has 60 subscribers in the first month. The number of subscribers in the second month is three times higher than the number of subscribers in the first month, but it also decreases by 30% in the third month. How many subscribers does the program have in total over the three months?

Answer:

In the first month, the program has 60 subscribers.

In the second month, the number of subscribers is three times higher than 60, which is 180 (3 x 60).

In the third month, the number of subscribers decreases by 30%, which is 180 - 30% of 180, or 180 - 54, which is 126.

Therefore, the total number of subscribers over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 426."	426

12	Carlos grows mango trees. The tree will cost him $90 to plant. Each year he will grow 7 mango trees, which he can sell for $1.5 each. He spends about $3 a year watering and feeding the trees. How many years will it take before he starts making money on the mango tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos grows mango trees. The tree will cost him $90 to plant. Each year he will grow 7 mango trees, which he can sell for $1.5 each. He spends about $3 a year watering and feeding the trees. How many years will it take before he starts making money on the mango tree?

Answer: 5 years.

Explanation:

Year 1: Carlos plants 7 mango trees at $90 each = $630
Year 2: Carlos grows 7 more mango trees = $630
Year 3: Carlos grows 7 more mango trees = $630
Year 4: Carlos grows 7 more mango trees = $630
Year 5: Carlos has 28 mango trees, each selling for $1.5 = $420

Total income in year 5 = $420

Total expenses in year 5 = $3 x 28 trees = $84

Profit in year 5 = $420 - $84 = $336

Therefore, it will take 5 years for Carlos to start making money on the mango trees."	5

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold one-third of her candy to the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of the rest to the orange house. If Melanie's candy was 5, how much did she start with?

Answer: 16

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Melanie sold one-third of her candy to the green house.
* She sold 2 more to the red house.
* She sold half of the rest to the orange house.

We know that Melanie sold a total of 5 candies. Let's break down how she sold them:

* One-third of 5 is 1 and a half (1.5).
* She sold 2 more to the red house, so she sold a total of 3 candies to the red house.
* Half of the rest is half of 2, which is 1.

So, Melanie started with 16 candies."	16
14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% of the rest enrolled in jazz dance, while the rest enrolled in tap dance. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in tap dance?	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% of the rest enrolled in jazz dance, while the rest enrolled in tap dance. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in tap dance?

Answer: 30%

Explanation:

Let's say x is the number of students enrolled in modern dance.

According to the problem, 20% of the students enrolled in modern dance, so the number of students enrolled in modern dance is:

x = 20% of 20 = 20/100 = 2/5 of the total number of students

Now, let's say y is the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.

According to the problem, 25% of the rest of the students enrolled in jazz dance, so the number of students enrolled in jazz dance is:

y = 25% of (20 - x) = 25% of 20 - 2x

Now, let's find the number of students enrolled in tap dance.

According to the problem, the rest of the students enrolled in tap dance, so the number of students enrolled in tap dance is:

z = 20 - x - y

Now, we can find the percentage of all students enrolled in tap dance.

Percentage of students enrolled in tap dance = (z/20) x 100

= (20 - x - y)/20 x 100

= (20 - 2x - 25% of (20 - x))/20 x 100

= (20 - 2x - 5x/20) / 20 x 100

= 30%

Therefore, the percentage of all students enrolled in tap dance is 30%."	30

A trader wants to choose between two options: a watch worth $5,000 or a commodity worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the watch market will rise by 2.5% while the commodity market will rise by 1.2% during the same month. If the trader wants to make a large profit at the end of this month by making a selection, what is the profit?

Answer:

If the trader chooses the watch, the profit will be:

2.5% x $5,000 = $125

If the trader chooses the commodity, the profit will be:

1.2% x $8,000 = $96

Therefore, the trader should choose the watch, as it offers a higher profit of $125 compared to the commodity's profit of $96."	96

23	2 centimeters per square inch per hour of burning. How many centimeters per square inch will be after it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?	8	"Answer only. 
2 centimeters per square inch per hour of burning. How many centimeters per square inch will be after it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?

So, I know that there are 5 hours of burning, and the rate is 2 cm/sq in/hr.

So, I can calculate the total distance traveled as:

Distance = Rate x Time

Distance = 2 cm/sq in/hr x 5 hrs

Distance = 10 cm/sq in

Therefore, after 5 hours of burning, the material will have traveled 10 cm/sq in."	10

Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is a 25% discount over the original price. What was the original price of the book?

Please show your work.

Answer:

Let x be the original price of the book.

We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% less than the original price:

$19.50 = x - (25% of x)

To find the original price, we can solve for x:

x = $19.50 + (25% of $19.50)

x = $19.50 + $4.88

x = $24.38

So, the original price of the book was $24.38."	24

If one high-heeled shoe was $33 and the other was twice as much, how many dollars for the taco boots?	104	"Answer only. 
Gloria was shopping for shoes when she came across a pair of taco boots that fit her pocket. But she had to choose between the taco boots and two high-heeled shoes that cost a total of $5 less than the taco boots. If one high-heeled shoe was $33 and the other was twice as much, how many dollars for the taco boots?

Let's call the cost of one high-heeled shoe x.

Since the other high-heeled shoe is twice as much, it will cost 2x.

The total cost of both high-heeled shoes is x + 2x = 3x.

The taco boots cost $33, so the equation is:

3x = 33 + 2x

Simplify the equation:

3x = 35

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So, one high-heeled shoe costs $11, and the other high-heeled shoe costs $22.

The taco boots cost $33."	33

John plans to sell his toys and use his money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. Later he buys 8 video games for $20 each and $5. How many Lego sets does he have left?

Answer:

John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each.

13 x $15 = $195

He has $195 from selling his Lego sets.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

8 x $20 = $160

He spends $160 on video games.

So, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

Therefore, he has 13 - 8 = 5 Lego sets left."	5

39	Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?

Answer: 2 miles.

Explanation:
Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

1. Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk.
2. She can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run.
3. She can fly at 3 miles per hour.

Now, let's convert the speeds to miles per hour:

1. Walking speed = 2 miles/hour (since she can walk at a speed twice as fast as she can run)
2. Running speed = 4 miles/hour (since she can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk)
3. Jumping speed = 2 miles/hour (since she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run)
4. Flying speed = 3 miles/hour

Now, we know that Dana wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time. Let's say she spends x hours running and y hours walking, where x + y = 6 (since she has 6 hours to spend in total).

Since she spends one-third of her running time, she runs for:

x = 6 / 3 = 2 hours

Since she spends two-thirds of her walking time, she walks for:

y = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance she covers:

Walking distance = y x walking speed = 3 x 2 = 6 miles

Running distance = x x running speed = 2 x 4 = 8 miles

Jumping distance = y x jumping speed = 3 x 2 = 6 miles

Flying distance = x x flying speed = 2 x 3 = 6 miles

Total distance = walking distance + running distance + jumping distance + flying distance = 6 +"	6

Polly can throw the golden staff, the only tool known to kill the dragon, from a height of 400 feet, if it is in the dragon's fire ring. But when Polly carries the jewel, she can throw the staff three times farther than if she does not carry the jewel. If she carries the jewel, how far away from the ring must Polly be and how far away from the dragon will the dragon be?	200	"Answer only. 
The giant dragon, Perg, sits atop Mount Farbo, spewing fire at anything within 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the golden staff, the only tool known to kill the dragon, from a height of 400 feet, if it is in the dragon's fire ring. But when Polly carries the jewel, she can throw the staff three times farther than if she does not carry the jewel. If she carries the jewel, how far away from the ring must Polly be and how far away from the dragon will the dragon be?

Answer:

Polly must be 500 feet away from the ring and 750 feet away from the dragon.

Explanation:

Let's call the distance from Polly to the ring ""x"". Since the staff can be thrown three times farther without the jewel, the distance from Polly to the dragon without the jewel is 3x.

With the jewel, the distance from Polly to the ring is 400 feet, so the distance from Polly to the dragon with the jewel is 400 + 3x.

Since the dragon is 1,000 feet away from the ring, the distance from the dragon to the ring is 1,000 - x.

We want Polly to be 500 feet away from the ring, so we set up the equation:

400 + 3x = 1,000 - x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 500

So Polly must be 500 feet away from the ring and 750 feet away from the dragon (3x + 400 = 1,000 - x)."	1000

On the way, she stopped at the store and bought postcards; at work, she put one postcard on each of 220 different cups of coffee. If there were 23 postcards left in total, how many postcards were in the stamps she bought?

Answer: 80.

Explanation: Candice had 80 postcards in her purse to begin with, and she put one postcard on each of 220 cups of coffee, for a total of 220 - 1 = 219 postcards used. That means she had 80 - 219 = 3 postcards left over."	3
47	John bought twice as many red teas as the green tea. The red tea was 50% more expensive than the green tea. He spent $200 on the green tea which was $40 each. How much did he spend on the tea?	800	"Answer only. 
John bought twice as many red teas as the green tea. The red tea was 50% more expensive than the green tea. He spent $200 on the green tea which was $40 each. How much did he spend on the tea?

Let x be the number of green tea bags John bought.

Since John bought twice as many red tea bags as green tea bags, he bought 2x red tea bags.

The cost of 1 green tea bag is $40, so the total cost of x green tea bags is:

40x

The cost of 1 red tea bag is $40 + 50% of $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

Therefore, the total cost of 2x red tea bags is:

60x

Since John spent $200 on the tea, we can set up the equation:

40x + 60x = 200

Combine like terms:

100x = 200

x = 2

So John bought 2 green tea bags and 4 red tea bags.

The total cost of the tea is:

40(2) + 60(4) = 80 + 240 = 320

John spent $320 on the tea."	320

Uriah's briefcase was too heavy for him. He needed to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books each weighed 1/4 of a pound while each toy weighed 1/2 of a pound. If he removed 30 comic books, how many toys did he need to remove?

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* The total weight of the briefcase is 15 pounds.
* Each comic book weighs 1/4 of a pound.
* Each toy weighs 1/2 of a pound.

So, if we remove 30 comic books, we know that:

30 comic books x 1/4 pound per comic book = 7 1/2 pounds

We need to remove 7 1/2 pounds from the briefcase.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 of a pound, we can remove:

7 1/2 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 15 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his briefcase to reduce its weight by 15 pounds."	15

For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic would charge $60 and for each car tire repaired, the mechanic would charge $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 cars. On Sunday, the mechanic repaired 12 truck tires and no truck tires. How much money did the mechanic lose that day?

Answer: The mechanic lost $240.

Explanation:

Truck tires repaired on Thursday: 6 x $60 = $360
Car tires repaired on Thursday: 4 x $40 = $160
Total income on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Truck tires repaired on Sunday: 12 x $60 = $720
Total income on Sunday: $720

Total income for the week: $520 + $720 = $1,240

Loss = Total income for the week - Total cost of repairs
= $1,240 - $60 x 6 (truck tires repaired on Thursday)
= $1,240 - $360
= $240

Therefore, the mechanic lost $240 that day."	240

Jean has 30 olips. Jean eats 2 of the olips. With the remaining olips, Jean wants to be 2 olips in a container. How many containers can Jean fill?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

Jean has 30 olips and eats 2, so Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 olips left.

To fill 2 olips in a container, Jean needs 2 containers.

Since Jean has 28 olips left, Jean can fill 28 / 2 = 14 containers.

So, Jean can fill 12 containers with 2 olips each."	2

The total weight of the driver and the empty vehicle is 3755 pounds. What limits the number of boxes that can be loaded into the freight car that will not exceed the weight of the bridge?

Answer: 333 boxes.

Explanation:

Total weight of the driver and the empty vehicle = 3755 pounds
Total weight of one box = 15 pounds
Total weight of 333 boxes = 333 x 15 pounds = 4995 pounds

Since the total weight of the boxes cannot exceed the weight of the bridge, we can load at most 333 boxes onto the freight truck."	333

If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives a $50,000 annual pension. After 20 years, she is entitled to a 5% annual pension. If she retires after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

I need to calculate the pension amount for Marcy after 30 years of service. To do this, I need to calculate the pension amount for each year of service and then add them up.

Year 1: $50,000 (annual pension)
Year 2-20: $50,000 x 5% = $2500 (annual pension increase)
Year 21-30: $50,000 x 5% x 10 = $10,000 (annual pension increase)

Total pension amount after 30 years: $50,000 + $2500 + $10,000 = $65,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $65,000."	65000

Aleena paid a monthly fee of $140 for an e-wallet service. If the e-wallet company received the first payment for the first half of the year with a 10% discount for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount paid to the e-wallet company at the end of the year.

Answer: $1664.

Calculation:

First half of the year:

$140 x 6 months = $840

Second half of the year:

$840 x 6 months = $480

Total amount paid:

$840 + $480 = $1320

However, there is a 10% discount for the second half of the year, so:

$1320 x 10% = $132

Total amount paid:

$1320 - $132 = $1188

Therefore, the total amount paid to the e-wallet company at the end of the year is $1188."	1188

In the rest of the puppy's life, Cecilia will use 2/3 of a bag of dog food each day, so she will use 2 x 365 = 730 bags in total.

Therefore, Cecilia will use a total of 180 + 730 = 910 bags of dog food in the first year."	910
77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does 400.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does 400.

Please show work. 

Thank you!

Answer:

Let's say Raymond does x laundry. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, Sarah does 4x laundry. And David does 400 laundry.

We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 4(400)

4x = 1600

x = 1600/4

x = 400

So, Raymond does 400 laundry and David does 400 x 4 = 1600 laundry.

The difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is:

1600 - 400 = 1200

Therefore, the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is 1200."	1200

Gene sews clothes from old t-shirts. He receives one dress for each vacation from his previous job. Each dress has its own sewing block. He sews each skirt from a block of different vacation years. He goes on vacation four times a year and has been going on vacation since he was 23. He is now 34 years old. How many sewing blocks in total?

Can you help me with this problem? Thank you!

Comment: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with your question. To start, let's break down the information we have:

1. Gene sews clothes from old t-shirts.
2. He receives one dress for each vacation from his previous job.
3. Each dress has its own sewing block.
4. He sews each skirt from a block of different vacation years.
5. He goes on vacation four times a year.
6. He has been going on vacation since he was 23 years old.
7. He is now 34 years old.

From this information, we can deduce that Gene has been on vacation for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).

Now, let's think about the number of sewing blocks Gene has. Since he goes on vacation four times a year, he has four blocks for each year he has been on vacation. Therefore, Gene has 11 x 4 = 44 sewing blocks in total.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."	44

Greg has a final alarm that goes off three times a day as a warning. Once the alarm goes off, it goes off until Greg turns it off. The first time it goes off today, it goes off four times. The second time, it goes off three times as much as the first time. The third time, it goes off half as much as the second time. How many times does the alarm go off in total?

Answer:

The first time the alarm goes off, it goes off four times.
The second time, it goes off three times as much as the first time, so it goes off 3 x 4 = 12 times.
The third time, it goes off half as much as the second time, so it goes off 12 / 2 = 6 times.
In total, the alarm goes off 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times."	22

Christina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest she invited, because 1/4 of the guests didn't show up. She invited 16 friends. The gift bags are $2 each. How much will it cost?

Answer: $160.

Explanation:

16 friends x 1/4 missing guests = 4 missing guests

16 friends x 3 remaining guests = 48 remaining guests

48 remaining guests x 75 gift bags per guest = 3450 gift bags

3450 gift bags x $2 each = $6900

Since 1/4 of the guests didn't show up, Christina needs 75 gift bags for each of the 4 missing guests, which is 300 gift bags.

Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is $6900 + $300 = $7200."	7200

Lee ran the 400 meters two minutes faster than Gerald ran the 400 meters. But Gerald changed his diet which allowed his running speed to differ by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 minutes, how could Gerald, with his different diet, run the 400 meters in less than a minute?

Answer: 58 seconds.

Explanation:

Let's say Gerald's original time was x minutes.

Since Lee ran the 400 meters two minutes faster than Gerald, Lee's time would be x + 2 minutes.

We know that Gerald changed his diet, which allowed his running speed to differ by 10%. This means that his new time would be 90% of his original time.

So, Gerald's new time would be 0.9x minutes.

We also know that Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

So, Gerald's original time was 36 minutes.

Now, we can find Gerald's new time:

0.9x = 0.9(36) = 32.4

Rounding to the nearest minute, Gerald's new time would be 32 minutes.

Therefore, Gerald, with his different diet, could run the 400 meters in 32 minutes, which is less than a minute."	32

95	Out of 200 fifth graders, two-fifths are male while two-thirds are female in scouts, how many women are not in scouts?	40	"Answer only. 
Out of 200 fifth graders, two-fifths are male while two-thirds are female in scouts, how many women are not in scouts?

I am unsure how to approach this problem. Can someone explain how to solve it?

Answer:

There are 200 fifth graders in total.

Two-fifths of them are male, which means that 2/5 of 200 is 40 males.

So, there are 40 males in scouts.

Two-thirds of them are female, which means that 2/3 of 200 is 133 females.

So, there are 133 females in scouts.

To find out how many women are not in scouts, we need to subtract the number of females in scouts from the total number of females.

133 - 40 = 93

So, there are 93 women who are not in scouts."	93

Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept two-thirds of Harry's sleep. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James?

Answer: 2 hours.

Harry slept for 9 hours, so he slept for 9 x 2 = 18 hours in total.

James slept for 2/3 of Harry's sleep, so James slept for 18 x 2/3 = 12 hours.

Therefore, Harry slept 2 hours more than James."	2

Let X be the number of cars that can pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

We know that 20 cars entered in the last 15 minutes, so the total number of cars in the traffic jam is:

X + 20

He dropped 5 while waiting for it to cool, now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?

Answer: 55 cookies.

Explanation:

Let's say Henry made x cookies last year.

This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he made 2x cookies.

He dropped 5 cookies while waiting for them to cool, so he has a total of 110 cookies.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x + 5 = 110

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 105

x = 55

Therefore, Henry made 55 cookies last year."	55

The boat sails while afloat. The boat drinks two liters of water for every foot when it returns to port. It takes about 16 minutes to cross 20 feet. The port is 64 minutes away. How much water has the boat dragged by the time Julia arrives at the port?

The boat sails at a rate of two liters per foot. So, if the boat travels 20 feet, it will drink 20 x 2 = 40 liters of water.

The boat takes 16 minutes to cross 20 feet, so it travels at a rate of 20/16 = 1.25 feet per minute.

The port is 64 minutes away, so the boat will travel 64 x 1.25 = 80 feet by the time Julia arrives at the port.

Therefore, the boat will have dragged 80 x 2 = 160 liters of water by the time Julia arrives at the port."	160

A classroom has a whiteboard that is divided among 4 teachers who take turns to use the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is turned off 3 times in each lesson, how many times is the whiteboard turned off during the day?

Answer: 24 times.

Please help me with this problem. Thank you.

Answer:

To find out how many birds can be seen in Jamal's bird in the zoo, we need to first find out how many pictures Brittany's telescope can take.

We know that Brittany's telescope can take 50 times more pictures than Jamal's bird in the zoo. So, if Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures, Brittany's telescope can take 1800 x 50 = 90,000 pictures.

Now, we know that Jamal's telescope can take 6 times more pictures than Brittany's telescope. So, Jamal's telescope can take 90,000 / 6 = 15,000 pictures.

Therefore, we can see 15,000 birds in Jamal's bird in the zoo."	15000

She has an order for ten 2 × 4 × 10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4 × 4 × 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells all of them, how much profit will she make?

Answer:

Total cost of the wood Sasha has:

10 × $10 = $100
5 × $16 = $80
Total cost = $180

Total revenue from selling all the wood:

10 × $10 = $100
5 × $16 = $80
Total revenue = $180

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $180 - $180
= $0

Katy brews coffee with a ratio of 7:13 of sugar to a teaspoon of water. Using a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, calculate how much sugar to a teaspoon of water she used.

Answer: 
To find out how much sugar Katy used, we need to multiply the number of teaspoons of water by the ratio of sugar to water.

1 cup = 8 oz = 250 ml

1 teaspoon = 5 ml

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of water is:

1 cup = 250 ml / 5 ml/teaspoon = 50 teaspoons

Now, we can calculate the amount of sugar used:

Sugar used = 120 teaspoons x 7/13 = 90 teaspoons

So, Katy used 90 teaspoons of sugar to 50 teaspoons of water.

Therefore, the ratio of sugar to water is 90:50 or 3:2."	2

A customs officer at the Seaside Port of Entry counted 2 cargo trucks, each containing 5 cars. On the second day, several more trucks were imported, bringing the total number of vehicles at the port to 30. Calculate the number of trucks imported on the second day, assuming that all the trucks contained 5 cars.

Answer: 6 trucks.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of trucks imported on the second day.

Since each truck contains 5 cars, the total number of cars imported on the second day is 6x.

We know that the total number of cars at the port on the second day is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

So, 6 trucks were imported on the second day."	6

If Adrien and Lylah's salaries are the same and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate their total salary after four years?	95200	"Answer only. 
Adrien's total salary is 30 percent more than Lylah's. After four years, her salary is the same and she is earning 40% more than she was earning four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries are the same and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate their total salary after four years?

Answer: $64,000

Explanation:
Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Lylah's salary after four years is the same as Adrien's salary after four years.

Adrien's salary after four years is 30% more than Lylah's salary after four years.

So, Adrien's salary after four years is:

$40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000

Therefore, Adrien's total salary after four years is $52,000.

Lylah's total salary after four years is also $52,000."	52000

Sadie slept for 8 hours on Fridays. For about two days, she slept less than 2 hours each, because she had to finish her homework each time. If she slept an hour more than she slept on two days, how many hours did she sleep in total this whole week?

Answer:

Sadie slept for a total of 9 hours this week.

Explanation:

Sadie slept for 8 hours on Fridays, so she slept for 8 hours on the other days as well. Since she slept less than 2 hours each of those days, she slept a total of 6 hours on those days. In total, Sadie slept for 8 + 6 = 9 hours this week."	9
123	Rosie could run 10 miles in 3 hours. Then she ran 5 miles an hour. How many miles could she run in 7 hours?	50	"Answer only. 
Rosie could run 10 miles in 3 hours. Then she ran 5 miles an hour. How many miles could she run in 7 hours?

Answer: 12 miles.

Explanation:

Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, so her rate is 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour.

If she runs for 7 hours, she can run 7 x 3.33 = 23.31 miles.

Since rounding up to the nearest whole number is usually the preferred method, Rosie can run 24 miles in 7 hours."	7

A hospital sees 500 people a day. The average time it takes to respond to a patient is 24 hours. Doctors make $150 an hour from the hospital, and the hospital makes $200 an hour from the patients. How much money does the hospital make from scans?

Answer: $250,000

Explanation:

1. Total number of patients per day = 500
2. Average time to respond to a patient = 24 hours
3. Doctor's fee per hour = $150
4. Hospital's fee per hour = $200
5. Total number of hours worked per day = 24 hours
6. Total amount earned by doctors per day = 500 patients x $150 per hour = $75,000
7. Total amount earned by hospital per day = 500 patients x $200 per hour = $100,000
8. Total amount earned from scans per day = Not given
9. To find the total amount earned from scans, we need to know the number of scans performed per day.
10. Let's assume that the hospital performs 100 scans per day (this is a random number, and the actual number could be higher or lower).
11. Scan fee per patient = Not given
12. Total amount earned from scans per day = 100 scans x Scan fee per patient = $10,000 (assuming a random scan fee of $100 per patient)
13. Total amount earned from scans per day = $10,000
14. Total amount earned by hospital per day = $100,000 (from patients) + $10,000 (from scans) = $110,000
15. Total amount earned by hospital per year = $110,000 x 365 days = $39,950,000

Therefore, the hospital makes $39,950,000 per year from patients and scans."	39950000

Nissa hired 60 employees to play elves in her shop's Santa's village. Ten percent of the elves were shot by children, and nine percent of the elves were shot by children. How many elves were left?

Answer:

There were 60 elves in total.

Ten percent of 60 is 6 (60 x 0.10 = 6). So, 6 elves were shot by children.

Nine percent of 60 is 5 (60 x 0.09 = 5). So, 5 elves were shot by children.

Therefore, there were 60 - 6 - 5 = 59 elves left."	59

Of the 20 cars available for hire, 12 are autonomous cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. How many of the cars are semi-automatic?

A) 2
B) 4
C) 6
D) 8

Please help me with the solution. Thank you.

Answer:

C) 6

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given:

12 autonomous cars + 4 manual cars + semi-automatic cars = 20 cars in total.

We know that the number of autonomous cars is 12, and the number of manual cars is 4.

So, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of autonomous and manual cars from 20:

20 - 12 - 4 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 semi-automatic cars available for hire. The correct answer is C) 6."	6

There are 700 eggs in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, and twice as many hives as there are queens. How many workers are there?

There are 700 eggs in the hive.

There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, and twice as many hives as there are queens.

How many workers are there?

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. There are 700 eggs in the hive.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives.
3. There are twice as many hives as there are queens.

We can start by finding out how many hives there are:

1. There are 700 eggs in the hive.
2. There are twice as many hives as there are queens.

Let's assume there are x queens. Then, there are 2x hives.

Now, we can find out how many worker bees there are:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives.
2. There are 2x hives.

So, there are 2x x = 2x worker bees.

Now, we can find out how many workers there are:

1. There are 700 eggs in the hive.
2. There are 2x worker bees.

So, there are 2x x = 2x x = 2(700) = 1400 workers.

Therefore, there are 1400 workers in the hive."	1400

Johnny is collecting toys in his bedroom. He has thrown a box of 500 Lego bricks on the floor, another with three times the number of 500 bricks, and another with a quarter of the number of bricks. How many stalls does Johnny make if he collects all the Lego bricks?

Answer: 

To find out how many Lego bricks Johnny has in total, we need to find out how many bricks are in each box and add them up.

Box 1 contains 500 bricks, so Johnny has 500 bricks in this box.

Box 2 contains 3 times 500 = 3 x 500 = 1500 bricks.

Box 3 contains a quarter of 500 = 500/4 = 125 bricks.

Adding up all the bricks, Johnny has a total of:

2. Twice as many bees as the first one leaving the hive flew off the bridge in the next 6 hours, so 2 x 15 = 30 bees flew off the bridge.
3. Since all the bees that left before did not return, there were no bees returning in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, Debra saw 0 bees returning to the bridge in the last 6 hours of the day."	6

Bill cooks 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes a day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to compare the lengths of the products he cooks to each other, how long would they be in feet?

Answer:

* 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Total length = 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

158	Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought four rings worth $1.5 each, two books worth $4 each, and a bond paper rim worth $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?	34	"Answer only. 
Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought four rings worth $1.5 each, two books worth $4 each, and a bond paper rim worth $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?

Please help me with this problem. I am having a hard time solving it.

Answer:

To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items he bought.

The cost of the four rings is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the two books is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper rim is $20.

Adding up the costs of all the items, we get:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $34

So Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."	34

On Victory Day, the tank was filled with 7 feet more water. On Independence Day, the tank was two-thirds as deep as it was on Victory Day. What was the tank's depth on Independence Day?

Let's use ""D"" to represent the depth of the tank on Victory Day and ""d"" to represent the depth of the tank on Independence Day.

We know that on Victory Day, the tank was filled with 7 feet more water, so:

D = 7 + d

We also know that on Independence Day, the tank was two-thirds as deep as it was on Victory Day, so:

d = 2/3D

There are four birds in the Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is eight years old, what is the average age of the four birds?

A) 6 years
B) 7 years
C) 8 years
D) 9 years

Answer: C) 8 years

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the ages of the birds:

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is 8 - 3 = 5 years old.
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Sally Four is 5 / 2 = 2.5 years old.
Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Thirtytwo is also 2.5 years old.

Now, let's calculate the average age of the four birds:

(5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 8) / 4 = 8 years

So, the average age of the four birds is 8 years."	8

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?

Answer:

Jessica needs to pay at least $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 per month to pay off all of her debts.

If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay $1,000 x 1.5 = $1,500 per month.

Over the course of a year, Jessica will pay $1,500 x 12 = $18,000 to pay off all of her debts."	18000

Billy is borrowing a bunch of knives to make a salad for his family's big gathering. It's a big party, so he needs to go to 60 knives. The knives are almost the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to cut a knife, and five minutes to cut it. How long will it take billy to finish the knives?

Answer: 10 minutes.

Explanation:

To find out how long it will take Billy to finish the knives, we need to know how many knives he needs to cut and how long it takes him to cut each one.

Billy needs to cut 60 knives, and it takes him about a minute and a half to cut each one. So, to calculate how long it will take him to finish all 60 knives, we can multiply the number of knives by the time it takes to cut each one:

60 knives x 1.5 minutes/knife = 90 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 90 minutes, or 10 minutes, to finish all the knives."	10

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they sell it for $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar. They sell each bottle for $0.50, and they get 20 bottles for a gallon. If they get $25 in profit, how much do they spend on lemonade?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. They sell each gallon for $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar, so the total revenue from each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
2. They sell each bottle for $0.50, so the total revenue from 20 bottles is $0.50 x 20 = $10.
3. They get $25 in profit, so the total revenue from all gallons sold must be $5 x (20 gallons) = $100.
4. To find out how much they spend on lemonade, we need to subtract the cost of the lemonade from the total revenue: $100 - $10 = $90.

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spend $90 on lemonade."	90

Rani has 10 more cancers than Monic, who has 4 fewer than Bo. If Bo has 40, calculate how many cancers all three of them have together.

Let's say Monic has x cancers.

Monic has 4 fewer cancers than Bo, so Bo has x + 4 cancers.

Rani has 10 more cancers than Monic, so Rani has x + 10 cancers.

Together, Bo, Monic, and Rani have x + 4 + (x + 10) = 3x + 14 cancers.

Since Bo has 40 cancers, we know that x = 10.

So, Monic has 10 - 4 = 6 cancers, and Rani has 10 + 4 = 14 cancers.

Together, Bo, Monic, and Rani have 40 + 6 + 14 = 60 cancers."	60

How is it possible (expressed as a percentage) that he rolled a number greater than 3 rather than rolling two even numbers over and over again?

Answer:

To roll a number greater than 3, he would have to roll a 4, 5, or 6.

Probability of rolling a 4: 1/6 = 0.17
Probability of rolling a 5: 1/6 = 0.17
Probability of rolling a 6: 1/6 = 0.17

Total probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 = 0.51

A merchant buys a few sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry each sack from the farm to the store, and the merchant makes $400 in total after selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 
The merchant sold 12 sacks of wheat.

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. The merchant paid $20 per sack for the wheat.
2. It cost $2 per sack to carry the wheat from the farm to the store.
3. The merchant made $400 in total after selling all the sacks.

Now, let's think about how the merchant could have made $400 if he sold all the sacks for $30 each. We know that 12 x $30 = $360, so the merchant would have made $400 if he sold 12 sacks.

Therefore, the merchant sold 12 sacks of wheat."	12

John eats peaches for three hours. He can eat two peaches a minute. How many peaches does he eat?

I can't answer this question because it is based on a false assumption that John can eat two peaches a minute. The question is asking for the number of peaches John eats in three hours, but the rate at which he eats them is not two peaches per minute.

To answer this question, we would need to know the correct rate at which John eats peaches, not just a false assumption. Additionally, we would need to know how many minutes John spends eating peaches in order to calculate the total number of peaches he eats.

195	The price of an eraser is the sum of the price of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil is $1.20, and an eraser is $0.30. How much will 8 erasers cost?	12	"Answer only. 
The price of an eraser is the sum of the price of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil is $1.20, and an eraser is $0.30. How much will 8 erasers cost?

Answer: $9.60.

Explanation:

To find the cost of 8 erasers, we need to find the cost of 1 eraser first.

The cost of 1 eraser is the sum of the price of 1 pencil and the price of 1 eraser:

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

So, the cost of 1 eraser is $1.50.

To find the cost of 8 erasers, we multiply the cost of 1 eraser by 8:

$1.50 x 8 = $12.00

So, the cost of 8 erasers is $12.00."	12

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she received three times that amount. In the second month, she received 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, she received twice the total number of Pokemon cards she received in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the first month, she received three times that amount, so she received 20 x 3 = 60 more cards.
3. In the second month, she received 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she received 60 - 20 = 40 fewer cards.
4. In the third month, she received twice the total number of Pokemon cards she received in the first and second months, so she received 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 more cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 Pokemon cards."	320

Baldur pumps water from a well. He gets 5 buckets of water in the morning and 6 buckets of water in the afternoon. If a bald eagle has 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get per day?

Answer: 11 liters

Explanation:

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 buckets of water, and each bucket contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

In total, Baldur gets 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day."	55

202	Josie grew grapes on her 10 acre farm. One acre yields five grapes per year, and one grape yields two barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does your farm produce per year?	100	"Answer only. 
Josie grew grapes on her 10 acre farm. One acre yields five grapes per year, and one grape yields two barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does your farm produce per year?

Answer: 10,000 barrels.

Explanation:

* One acre yields 5 grapes per year.
* One grape yields 2 barrels of wine.
* Therefore, one acre yields 5 x 2 = 10 barrels of wine.
* Since Josie has 10 acres, her farm produces 10 x 10 = 100 barrels of wine.
* However, since there are 2 barrels in each grape, we can divide the total by 2 to get the number of barrels of wine:

100 barrels / 2 = 50,000 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 50,000 barrels of wine per year."	50000

Micheal likes to ride a bicycle. He rides five times a week, going 25 kilometers each time. He did this for four weeks, then decided, to ride the bicycle only twice a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and did this for three weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal walk in total?

Answer: 600 kilometers.

Explanation:

Micheal rode the bicycle for four weeks, five times a week, for a total of 20 weeks (4 weeks x 5 rides/week). He rode 25 kilometers each time, for a total of:

20 weeks x 25 kilometers/week = 500 kilometers

Then, Micheal rode the bicycle for three weeks, twice a week, for a total of 6 weeks (3 weeks x 2 rides/week). He rode 60 kilometers each time, for a total of:

6 weeks x 60 kilometers/week = 360 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode his bicycle is:

On Labor Day she went to another store and bought five times as many white breads as she did on Victory Day. How many white breads did she buy after all three days?

Answer: 39 white breads.

Explanation:

Day 1 (Good Friday): Rose bought 4 white breads.

Day 2 (Victory Day): Rose bought 3 times as many white breads as she did on Good Friday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 white breads.

Day 3 (Labor Day): Rose bought 5 times as many white breads as she did on Victory Day, which is 5 x 12 = 60 white breads.

Total number of white breads bought by Rose after all three days = 4 + 12 + 60 = 39 white breads."	39

Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than six cans sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the price of each cup

Let X be the price of one can.

According to the problem, six cans sold for $6,000, so the total revenue from selling six cans is:

6 cans x $6,000/can = $36,000

Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than the total revenue from selling six cans, so the price of each cup is:

$36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Therefore, the price of each cup is $34.80."	34

Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket is about $30, and the shoes are $20 each. Sara cleans the neighborhood four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cleans the field. If Sara had already saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many times did she have to clear the field to buy the jacket and shoes?

Answer: 
Sara had to clean the field 4 times to buy the jacket and shoes.

Explanation:

Total cost of jacket and shoes = $30 + $20 + $20 = $70

Total amount Sara had saved before babysitting = $10

Total amount Sara needed to buy the jacket and shoes = $70 - $10 = $60

Number of times Sara needed to clean the field to buy the jacket and shoes = $60 / $5 = 12 times

Therefore, Sara had to clean the field 12 times to buy the jacket and shoes."	12

Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Please help me with this problem. I have tried to solve it but I can't seem to get the right answer.

Answer:

Jerry has 12 red chickens and 10 white chickens.

Explanation:

Let's say Jerry has x red chickens and y white chickens.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by the red chickens is 3x.

The white chickens lay less than 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by the white chickens is 5y - 5.

Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs he collects is 3x + 5y - 5.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5y - 5 = 42

Now we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x + 5y = 42 + 5

This simplifies to:

3x + 5y = 47

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 47 / 3

x = 15

Now we know that Jerry has 15 red chickens. To find out how many white chickens he has, we can subtract the number of red chickens from the total number of chickens:

y = 42 - 15

y = 27

So Jerry has 15 red chickens and 27 white chickens."	27

Gary likes to walk around the edge of a surrounding park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 to 6 miles. If he walks 3 hours an hour, how many hours does he walk in total?

Answer: 3 hours x 4 miles = 12 miles

To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to multiply the distance he walks by the number of hours he walks. In this case, Gary walks for 3 hours and walks a total distance of 4 miles (since the park is a rectangle measuring 1.5 to 6 miles). Therefore, the total time Gary spends walking is:

3 hours x 4 miles = 12 miles

So, Gary spends 12 miles walking."	12

While at the dollar store, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. The next day, he counted 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?

Answer: 550.

Explanation:

Let's break this down step by step:

Day 1: Sloane counted 100 customers.

Day 2: Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so he counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Day 3: Sloane counted 500 customers. To find out how many customers he counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers he counted on the first two days to the total number of customers on the third day:

100 (Day 1) + 150 (Day 2) + 500 (Day 3) = 550.

Therefore, Sloane counted 550 customers on the third day."	550

Jerry has two swimming pools, both leaking 4 gallons of water per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the volume of the small pool. Now the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?

Answer: 64 gallons.

Explanation:

Let's say the volume of the small pool is x gallons.

Since the big pool has twice the volume of the small pool four minutes ago, the volume of the big pool is 2x gallons.

We know that both pools are leaking 4 gallons of water per minute, so the volume of the big pool after four minutes is:

2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16

Since the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool now, the volume of the small pool is:

x = 64

So, the small pool has 64 gallons of water now."	64

Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and a matching belt for $32.00. Her job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours would she have to work to buy what she wants?

Answer:

Lori would have to work 40 hours to buy the shoes and belt.

Explanation:

To find out how many hours Lori would have to work to buy the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage.

$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

$352.00 ÷ $8.00/hour = 40 hours

Therefore, Lori would have to work 40 hours to buy the shoes and belt."	40

Answer: Jojo scored 88 points.

Explanation: Let's start by using the information that Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Celine used 90 liters of the water in the water tank for her small garden. Then she had the opportunity to collect twice as much rainwater. How many liters of water are in the water tank now?

Answer: 180 liters.

Explanation:

If Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank for her garden, then the amount of water left in the tank is:

Ashlyn went to the farm after two months of planting and found that 30% of the watermelons were ripe, so she took them home. When she came back after two harvests, 3/4 of the dead melons were ripe, so she harvested them.

How many watermelons did Ashlyn harvest in total? 

Hint: There are 4 harvests in total.

Answer: 108 watermelons.

Can you explain the reasoning behind the answer?

Answer:

Let's break down the information given:

1. 30% of the watermelons were ripe after 2 months of planting.
2. 3/4 of the dead melons were ripe after 2 harvests.

So, let's calculate the number of watermelons that were ripe after 2 months of planting:

30% of 100% = 30%

There were 100 watermelons planted, so:

30% of 100 = 30 watermelons were ripe after 2 months.

Now, let's calculate the number of watermelons that were harvested after 2 harvests:

3/4 of 100% = 75%

There were 75 watermelons that were ripe and harvested after 2 harvests.

Now, let's calculate the total number of watermelons harvested:

30 + 75 = 105

So, Ashlyn harvested 105 watermelons in total.

There are 4 harvests in total, so:

105 / 4 = 26

Mark bought 12 cars for his company. Each car cost $20,000. He paid a 10% tax on the cars plus an additional $1000 for the registration of each one. How much did he pay for all of it?

I can do this one!

Mark paid $20,000 x 12 = $240,000 for the cars.

He paid $240,000 x 10% = $24,000 in tax.

So, Mark paid a total of $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000 for all of it."	264000
231	Kylie and Robert want to help each other go to the beach to catch crabs. On business days, Kylie collects five times as many crabs as Robert, who collects 20 times as many.	50	"Answer only. 
Kylie and Robert want to help each other go to the beach to catch crabs. On business days, Kylie collects five times as many crabs as Robert, who collects 20 times as many.

On weekends, Kylie collects three times as many crabs as Robert.

How many crabs will they collect in total if they go to the beach together on a weekend?

Hint: Think about how many crabs each of them will collect on their own and how many they will collect together.

Answer:

Kylie will collect 3x as many crabs on a weekend, so she will collect 3(20) = 60 crabs.

Robert will collect 20 times as many crabs on a weekend, so he will collect 20(3) = 60 crabs.

Together, they will collect 60 + 60 = 120 crabs."	120

Steve decides to eat a lot of tomatoes, and he decides to grow his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend says he eats. He eats ten a day. If a tree produces six tomatoes, how many trees does it need?""

I understand the problem, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Can you help me?

Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to use a bit of logic and some basic math. Here's how we can approach it:

Let's say Steve eats x tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend says he eats, we know that x = 2y, where y is the number of tomatoes his girlfriend says he eats.

We also know that Steve eats ten tomatoes per day, so we can set up the equation:

2y = 10

Now we can solve for y:

2y = 10
2y = 20
y = 10

So, Steve's girlfriend says he eats ten tomatoes per day.

Now, let's think about the trees. If a tree produces six tomatoes, we need to know how many trees Steve needs to grow to eat ten tomatoes per day. We can set up the equation:

6x = 10

Where x is the number of trees Steve needs to grow.

Can you solve for x now?"	10

238	It took Joan two years to marry Mary and five years to marry Jessa - if Jessa is 20 years old, what is the average age of the women?	68	"Answer only. 
It took Joan two years to marry Mary and five years to marry Jessa - if Jessa is 20 years old, what is the average age of the women?

Note: The question is based on the information that Joan is 25 years old.

Answer: 22 years.

Explanation:

The average age of the women can be calculated by adding the ages of the three women and dividing by 3.

Age of Joan + Age of Mary + Age of Jessa = 25 + 20 + 20 = 65

65 / 3 = 21

Therefore, the average age of the women is 21 years."	21

240	James has six more candies than Robert. John has two more candies than Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?	21	"Answer only. 
James has six more candies than Robert. John has two more candies than Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?

Answer: 12

Explanation:
Let's say Robert has x candies.

James has x + 6 candies.
John has x + 2 candies.

We know that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 54

Solving for x, we get:

x = 48

Now, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:

John has 54 candies, and James has 48 candies, so:

John has 54 - 48 = 12 more candies than James."	12

Jason has a monthly communication plan of 1000 minutes. Every day he calls 15 minutes with his boss, and he has an extra 300 minutes this month with other people. How many minutes has Jason spent, if this month has 30 days?

Jason has a monthly communication plan of 1000 minutes. Every day he calls 15 minutes with his boss, and he has an extra 300 minutes this month with other people.

So, the total minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss is:

15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes

And the total minutes Jason spends on other calls is:

300 minutes - 450 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, the total minutes Jason has spent this month is:

450 minutes + 50 minutes = 500 minutes."	500
244	Griffin has 24 french fries, but Kyle takes 5 of them. Billy gets twice as many as Kyle.

If Griffin has 27 french fries, how many french fries does Ginger give to Griffin?	20	"Answer only. 
Griffin has 24 french fries, but Kyle takes 5 of them. Billy gets twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin some of her french fries, then Colby takes from Griffin, who gets three fewer than Kyle. If Griffin has 27 french fries, how many french fries does Ginger give to Griffin?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Kyle takes 5 french fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 french fries left.
2. Billy gets twice as many french fries as Kyle, so Billy gets 2 x 5 = 10 french fries.
3. Ginger gives Griffin some of her french fries, so Griffin gets x french fries from Ginger.
4. Colby takes french fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 19 - x french fries left.
5. Griffin has 27 french fries left, so we can set up the equation:

19 - x = 27

Solve for x:

x = 8

So Ginger gives Griffin 8 french fries."	8
245	The difference between the number of shells is twice the number of fish in each shell. If the two shells have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each shell?	7	"Answer only. 
The difference between the number of shells is twice the number of fish in each shell. If the two shells have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each shell?

I have tried to solve this problem using the fact that the number of shells is twice the number of fish in each shell, but I am not able to find the solution. Can you please help me?

Answer:

Let's say there are x fish in each shell.

Since the number of shells is twice the number of fish in each shell, the number of shells is 2x.

We know that the two shells have the same number of fish, so the number of fish in each shell is the same.

So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2(x)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 2x

Solving for x:

x = 1

So, there are 1 fish in each shell."	1

249	On Business Day, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. On Victory Day, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Business Day and 13 the next day. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories does Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Answer only. 
On Business Day, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. On Victory Day, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Business Day and 13 the next day. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories does Sue eat more than her sister?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. On Business Day, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister.
2. On Victory Day, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
3. Her sister ate five cookies on Business Day and 13 the next day.

Let's begin by finding out how many cookies Sue ate on Business Day:

4 times as many cookies as her sister = 4(5) = 20 cookies

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Victory Day:

Twice as many cookies as her sister = 2(13) = 26 cookies

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Sue ate on both days:

Business Day: 20 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 4000 calories
Victory Day: 26 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 5200 calories

Total calories Sue ate = 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many calories Sue's sister ate on both days:

Business Day: 5 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories
Victory Day: 13 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 2600 calories

Total calories Sue's sister ate = 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories

Therefore, Sue eats more calories than her sister by:

9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

So, Sue eats 5600 more calories than her sister."	5600
