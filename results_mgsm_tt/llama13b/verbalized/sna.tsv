2	Josh decides to try buying and selling a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 to renovate it. This increases the price of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Answer only. 
Josh decides to try buying and selling a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 to renovate it. This increases the price of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

Answer: $120,000

Explanation:

First, we need to find out the original price of the house before renovation.

Original price = $80,000

After renovation, the price of the house increases by 150%.

New price = Original price x 1.5

New price = $80,000 x 1.5

New price = $120,000

So, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

Answer: 25 cups.

Explanation:

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, she would give each chicken 20 x 3 = 60 cups of food in total per day.

Since she gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, she would give them 60 - 15 - 25 = 20 cups in the last meal of the day."	20
5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new home. A pair of glasses cost $5 but buying a second pair cost 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for these glasses?	64	"Answer only. 
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new home. A pair of glasses cost $5 but buying a second pair cost 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for these glasses?

Answer:

To find the cost of 16 glasses, we need to find 60% of the cost of one glass.

60% of $5 = 0.6 x $5 = $3

So, the cost of one additional glass is $3.

The total cost of 16 glasses is:

16 x $5 = $80

+ 16 x $3 = $48

Total cost = $80 + $48 = $128"	128
6	Toulouse has twice as many votes as Charleston. Charleston also has four more votes than Seattle. How many votes do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if Seattle has 20?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many votes as Charleston. Charleston also has four more votes than Seattle. How many votes do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if Seattle has 20?

Please help me with this problem. I have been trying to solve it for a while now but I am unable to do so.

Thank you.

Answer:

Let's say Toulouse has 2x votes, where x is the number of votes Charleston has.

We know that Charleston has four more votes than Seattle, so Charleston has 4 + x votes.

We also know that Toulouse has twice as many votes as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2x votes.

We can set up an equation based on these relationships:

2x + 4 + x = 20

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 4 = 20

Solving for x:

x = 8

So Charleston has 8 votes and Toulouse has 2x = 16 votes.

Therefore, the number of votes each city has is:

Toulouse: 16
Charleston: 8
Seattle: 4"	4
7	Carla is downloading a 200GB file. She usually downloads 2GB/minute, but 40% of the time in between downloads, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla restarts the download from the beginning. How long will it take to download the file?	160	"Answer only. 
Carla is downloading a 200GB file. She usually downloads 2GB/minute, but 40% of the time in between downloads, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla restarts the download from the beginning. How long will it take to download the file?

Answer: 100 minutes.

Explanation:

* Total file size = 200 GB = 200,000 MB
* Download rate = 2 GB/minute = 2000 MB/minute (when not restarting)
* Time to download = Total file size / Download rate = 200,000 MB / 2000 MB/minute = 100 minutes

However, since 40% of the time is spent restarting, the actual time to download the file will be longer.

* Time spent restarting = 40% of 100 minutes = 40 minutes
* Total time to download = 100 minutes + 40 minutes = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take Carla 140 minutes (or 2.33 hours) to download the 200 GB file."	200

John drives for 3 hours at 60mph and returns home after remembering that he forgot something at home. He tries to get home by 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop. He then spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, before he can drive the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. How far would he be from home by the end of 4 hours?

Please help me with this question. I'm really stuck on it.

Thank you.

Answer:

Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60mph.
2. He then spends 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop.
3. He spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph.
4. He drives the remaining 4 hours at 80mph.

We can start by calculating the distance John covers in the first 3 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60mph x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we can calculate the distance John covers during the 2 hours he spends waiting for traffic to stop:

Distance = 0 (since he is not moving)

Now, let's calculate the distance John covers during the middle part of the hour when he is running at 30mph:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Finally, we can calculate the distance John covers during the remaining 4 hours when he is driving at 80mph:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 80mph x 4 hours
Distance = 320 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances John covers:

Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 30 miles + 320 miles
Total distance = 530 miles

So, by the end of 4 hours, John would be 530 miles from home."	530
9	Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?

I need help with this problem.

Answer: $450

Explanation:

For the first 40 hours, Eliza will earn $10 an hour, so she will earn $400 (40 hours x $10 per hour).

For the additional 5 hours (45 hours - 40 hours), Eliza will earn 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $12 per hour (1.2 x $10 per hour). So, she will earn $60 for the additional 5 hours (5 hours x $12 per hour).

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week will be $400 + $60 = $460."	460

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastries: 3 dozen doughnuts for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen small cupcakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen small cheesecakes for $55 a dozen.	694	"Answer only. 
Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastries: 3 dozen doughnuts for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen small cupcakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen small cheesecakes for $55 a dozen.

How much did Toula pay for all of the pastries?

(Note: This is a word problem, so please provide your answer as a number and explain your reasoning.)

Answer: $245

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

* Doughnuts: $68/dozen x 3 dozen = $204
* Cupcakes: $80/dozen x 2 dozen = $160
* Cheesecakes: $55/dozen x 6 dozen = $330

Total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $245

Therefore, Toula paid $245 for all of the pastries."	245
12	Carlos has planted a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant, yields seven lemons a year that he sells for $1.50 each, and costs $3 to water and feed the insects.	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos has planted a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant, yields seven lemons a year that he sells for $1.50 each, and costs $3 to water and feed the insects.

a) Calculate the cost per lemon.

b) Calculate the break-even point in years.

c) Calculate the profit per year.

d) Calculate the payback period.

e) Calculate the internal rate of return.

Please provide step-by-step solutions.

Answer:

a) The cost per lemon can be calculated as follows:

Cost per lemon = Total cost / Number of lemons per year
= $90 / 7
= $12.86 per lemon

b) The break-even point can be calculated as follows:

Break-even point = Total cost / Selling price per lemon
= $90 / $1.50
= 60 lemons per year

c) The profit per year can be calculated as follows:

Profit per year = Selling price per lemon x Number of lemons per year
= $1.50 x 7
= $10.50 per year

d) The payback period can be calculated as follows:

Payback period = Total cost / Annual profit
= $90 / $10.50
= 8.6 years

e) The internal rate of return can be calculated as follows:

Internal rate of return = Discount rate at which NPV = 0
= IRR(0, $10.50, $12.86, 8.6)
= 12.2%

Please note that the calculations are based on the given data and assumptions, and may not reflect the actual costs and returns of a real lemon tree plantation."	12

14	In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?	60	"Answer only. 
In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?

Answer: 30%

Explanation:
Let X be the number of kids learning hip-hop dance.
Since 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, there are 20% of 20 = 4 kids learning modern dance.
Since 25% of the rest are learning jazz, there are 25% of (20 - 4) = 5 kids learning jazz.
So, the number of kids learning hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 5 = 11.
Therefore, the percentage of kids learning hip-hop dance is 11/20 = 30%."	30
15	A salesman has to choose between two sales: Jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to rise 2.5% and the electronics market to rise 1.2% in the same month. If the salesman expects a high profit at the end of the month, what profit would he make?	125	"Answer only. 
A salesman has to choose between two sales: Jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to rise 2.5% and the electronics market to rise 1.2% in the same month. If the salesman expects a high profit at the end of the month, what profit would he make?

Answer:

The salesman would make a higher profit from selling jewelry worth $5,000 because the expected rise in the jewelry market is higher than the expected rise in the electronics market.

Profit from selling jewelry = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125

Profit from selling electronics = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96

Therefore, the salesman would make a higher profit from selling jewelry worth $5,000."	5000

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?	57500	"Answer only. 
If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?

Answer:

To calculate the total hours worked per year, we need to first calculate the number of hours worked per week for each job.

For the teaching job, she works 35 hours per week.

For the cheerleading job, she works 15 hours per week.

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked per year for each job:

Teaching job:

35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Cheerleading job:

15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Now, let's add the total hours worked per year for both jobs:

1750 hours/year (teaching) + 750 hours/year (cheerleading) = 2500 hours/year

Finally, to calculate the total amount earned per year, we need to know the hourly wage for each job. Let's assume that the hourly wage for the teaching job is $25/hour and the hourly wage for the cheerleading job is $15/hour.

Total earnings for the year = (2500 hours/year x $25/hour) + (2500 hours/year x $15/hour)

Total earnings for the year = $62,500 + $37,500 = $100,000 per year."	100000

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and I plan to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water. But when pouring, I drop one liter of orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and I plan to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water. But when pouring, I drop one liter of orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

The problem is to find out how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture after adding the pineapple juice.

Let's assume that the orange juice has x liters of water and (10-x) liters of orange juice.

After adding the pineapple juice, the mixture will have (24-x) liters of water and (24-x) liters of pineapple juice.

So, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

(24-x) + (3/5)(15)

= (24-x) + 9

= 24 + 9 - x

= 33 - x

Since we know that the orange juice has two-thirds water, we can set up the equation:

2x/3 = 33 - x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So, there are 22 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture after adding the pineapple juice."	24

23	If a candle burns from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., how many centimeters will it shrink?	8	"Answer only. 
If a candle burns from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., how many centimeters will it shrink?

(Note: I know this is a very easy question, but I'm just starting out with candles and I want to make sure I understand the basics.)

Answer:

To find out how many centimeters the candle will shrink, we need to know how much wax the candle will burn during the 4 hours it is lit.

Let's assume that the candle burns at a constant rate, so the amount of wax it burns per hour is the same.

There are 4 hours in the burning period, so the total amount of wax burned is:

4 hours x constant rate of wax burned per hour = ?

Since we don't know the constant rate of wax burned per hour, we can't calculate the exact amount of wax burned. However, we can estimate the amount of wax burned based on the weight of the candle.

Let's assume that the candle weighs 500 grams before it is lit. After burning for 4 hours, the candle will weigh:

500 grams - amount of wax burned = ?

Since we don't know the amount of wax burned, we can't calculate the exact weight of the candle after it is lit. However, we can estimate the weight of the candle after it is lit based on the amount of wax burned.

Let's assume that the candle burns 20 grams of wax per hour. After burning for 4 hours, the candle will have burned a total of:

20 grams/hour x 4 hours = 80 grams of wax

So, the candle will weigh:

500 grams - 80 grams = 420 grams

To find out how many centimeters the candle will shrink, we need to know the density of the wax. Let's assume that the density of the wax is 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter.

Darrel and Allen have the same age divided by 7:11. If their combined age is 162 years, how old would Allen be today?

Answer:  Allen would be 71 years old.

Explanation:
Let's say Darrel's age is x.
Then, Allen's age would be x + 7.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162.
So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 162

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 7 = 162

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2x = 155

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 77

So, Darrel is 77 years old.
Allen is 77 + 7 = 84 years old."	84

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently he is making $5 for 4 yogurts. How much does he buy yogurts for 30 days?.	75	"Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently he is making $5 for 4 yogurts. How much does he buy yogurts for 30 days?.

This is a simple problem that can be solved by using basic math operations. Here's the solution:

If Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, then he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days.

Currently, he is making $5 for 4 yogurts, so the cost of one yogurt is $5 / 4 = $1.25.

Therefore, the total cost of 60 yogurts for 30 days is 60 x $1.25 = $75."	75

John is considering selling his toys and using the money to buy video games. He makes 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and is left with $5. How many Lego sets does he have left?

Answer: 5 Lego sets.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each.
* He uses the money to buy 8 video games for $20 each.
* He is left with $5.

To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to subtract the number of video games he bought from the number of Lego sets he sold:

13 (Lego sets sold) - 8 (video games bought) = 5

Therefore, John has 5 Lego sets left."	5

41	The legendary dragon, Perg, sits atop the summit of Mount Farbo, breathing fire from nearly 1,000 feet away. Polly can throw a Javelin javelin, a golden spear that can pierce the Dragon 400 feet away near the Dragon's flames. But with a sapphire gemstone in her hand, Polly can throw a javelin spear three times brighter than without a gemstone. If she holds a gemstone, how can Polly stand so far away from the Dragon's fire while she can throw a javelin javelin?	200	"Answer only. 
The legendary dragon, Perg, sits atop the summit of Mount Farbo, breathing fire from nearly 1,000 feet away. Polly can throw a Javelin javelin, a golden spear that can pierce the Dragon 400 feet away near the Dragon's flames. But with a sapphire gemstone in her hand, Polly can throw a javelin spear three times brighter than without a gemstone. If she holds a gemstone, how can Polly stand so far away from the Dragon's fire while she can throw a javelin javelin?

The question is asking for an explanation of how Polly can stand far away from the Dragon's fire while throwing a javelin, given that the Dragon is breathing fire from nearly 1,000 feet away and the javelin can only travel 400 feet.

Here's one possible explanation:

Polly can stand far away from the Dragon's fire because she has a special ability that allows her to throw the javelin with incredible accuracy and force, even from a distance. With the sapphire gemstone in her hand, the javelin becomes three times brighter, which helps Polly to see the Dragon more clearly and aim her throw more precisely. Additionally, the gemstone may have magical properties that enhance Polly's strength and accuracy, allowing her to throw the javelin further and with more force than she would be able to without it.

Therefore, even though the Dragon is breathing fire from nearly 1,000 feet away, Polly can stand far enough away from the Dragon to avoid being burned by the flames while still being able to throw the javelin with great accuracy and force."	1000

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. Each pound of beeswax can make 10 tall candles. Each pound of beeswax and candle wire costs $10.00 to get it. If he sells each candle for $2, how much profit does he make if he sells 20 candles?

Answer: $40.00

Explanation:

To find out how much profit Charlie makes, we need to subtract the cost of the materials from the revenue he gets from selling the candles.

Cost of materials: 20 candles x $10.00/candle = $200.00
Revenue: 20 candles x $2.00/candle = $40.00

Profit = Revenue - Cost of materials = $40.00 - $200.00 = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie makes a profit of $20.00 from selling 20 candles."	20

Meredith is a freelance journalist who writes about the topic of public health issues and then presents to clients every day as her life's work. The article takes 4 hours to research and write. Last week she wrote 5 articles on Monday with 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Find out how many hours she spent writing articles over three days.

Answer: 24 hours

Explanation:

Let x be the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday.

Since she wrote 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, she wrote 2/5x + 2/5x = 4x/5 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday, so she wrote 2(4x/5) = 8x/5 articles on Wednesday.

In total, Meredith wrote x + 4x/5 + 8x/5 = 12x/5 articles over the three days.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, Meredith spent 12x/5 \* 4 = 48x hours writing articles over the three days."	48

John buys red tires that are twice the size of blue tires. Red tires cost 50% more than blue tires. He spent $200 on a single blue tire that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on tires?

Answer:

Let the cost of a single blue tire be $40.

Since red tires are twice the size of blue tires, the cost of a single red tire will be $40 x 2 = $80.

John spent $200 on a single blue tire, so the cost of $200 / $40 = 5 blue tires.

Therefore, John spent $5 x $80 = $400 on tires."	400

Mechanics charge different rates for repairing truck tires and cars. A truck tire that is being repaired, a mechanic charges $60, and a car tire that is being repaired charges $40. Fourth, a mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Fifth, a mechanic fixed 12 car tires but no truck tires. How much money did he make on the day he earned the most money in his career?

Answer: 

Answer: $240.

Explanation:

The mechanic charged $60 for repairing each truck tire and $40 for repairing each car tire.

If the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, he would have earned:

6 truck tires x $60 = $360
4 car tires x $40 = $160

Total earnings = $360 + $160 = $520.

If the mechanic fixed 12 car tires but no truck tires, he would have earned:

12 car tires x $40 = $480

Total earnings = $480 + $520 = $1000.

Therefore, the mechanic earned $1000 on the day he earned the most money in his career."	1000

The Doubtfire sisters were driving home with seven kittens from a local zoo when their mother called to let them know that two of their pet kittens had had kittens. She said that Patchy, their first kitten, had had three times as many kittens as the previous ones, and Trixie, a kitten, had had 12. How many kittens do the Doubtfires have now?

I'm happy to help! Let's see...

Patchy had three times as many kittens as the previous ones, so if the previous ones had x kittens, Patchy had 3x kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

We know that the total number of kittens is 7 (the ones they adopted from the zoo) plus the number of kittens Patchy and Trixie had.

So we can set up the equation:

7 + 3x + 12 = ?

Can you solve for x and find out how many kittens the Doubtfires have now?"	12

Janet just gave her son Brooch. She paid $500 for the jewelry and $800 to the jeweler for it, after which she paid 10% of it to get insurance. How much did she pay?

Answer: $630

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the cost of the brooch:

$500 (purchase price) + $800 (jeweler's fee) = $1,300

Next, let's calculate the insurance premium:

10% of $1,300 = $130

So, Janet paid a total of $1,300 + $130 = $1,430 for the brooch, including the purchase price, jeweler's fee, and insurance premium."	1430

65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to take a nap and read somewhere between. He does this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks?	36	"Answer only. 
Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to take a nap and read somewhere between. He does this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks?

Answer:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time, so he watches TV for a total of 2 x 3 = 6 hours per week.

He spends 1 hour napping and reading each time, so he spends a total of 1 x 3 = 3 hours per week on napping and reading.

In four weeks, Jim spends a total of 6 hours per week x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV and 3 hours per week x 4 weeks = 12 hours napping and reading.

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 24 + 12 = 36 hours watching TV and reading in four weeks."	36

Judy teaches 5 dance classes, daily, during the week, and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she needs $15 per student, how much does she make per week?

Answer: $3,750 per week.

Explanation:

To find out how much Judy makes per week, we need to calculate the total amount of money she earns from all of her classes.

Number of classes per week = 5 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturdays) = 13 classes per week

Total number of students per week = 15 (students per class) x 13 (classes per week) = 195 students per week

Total amount earned per week = $15 (per student) x 195 (students per week) = $3,750 per week

Therefore, Judy makes $3,750 per week teaching dance classes."	3750

If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, what's the difference between Raymond and David's laundry if Sarah does 400 pounds?

Answer: 
Raymond does 1/2 as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 1/2 x 400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
David does 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, so David does 4 x 200 = 800 pounds of laundry.
Therefore, the difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds."	600

84	A soccer team played 22 games, winning 8 of them, and losing only one.	15	"Answer only. 
A soccer team played 22 games, winning 8 of them, and losing only one.

If they scored a total of 40 goals and allowed their opponents to score 12 goals, how many goals did they score in the games they won?

Please show your work.

Answer: 

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* The team played 22 games.
* They won 8 games and lost 1 game.
* They scored a total of 40 goals.
* They allowed their opponents to score 12 goals.

We can start by finding out how many goals they scored in the games they won:

8 wins x goals scored per win = total goals scored in wins

Since we know they won 8 games, we can set up the equation:

8 x G = 40

Where G is the number of goals scored in each win.

Solving for G, we get:

G = 40 / 8

G = 5

So, the team scored 5 goals per game in the games they won.

Now, let's find out how many goals they scored in the game they lost:

1 loss x goals scored per loss = total goals scored in loss

Since we know they lost 1 game, we can set up the equation:

1 x L = 12

Where L is the number of goals scored in the loss.

Solving for L, we get:

L = 12

So, the team scored 12 goals in the game they lost.

Therefore, the team scored a total of 5 x 8 = 40 goals in the games they won, and 12 goals in the game they lost."	12

Answer: 
Gene has 4 x 12 = 48 bedspreads.

Gene has been going on vacation for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).
He went on vacation 4 times a year, so he has 11 x 4 = 44 vacations.
Each vacation has its own bedspread, so Gene has 44 bedspreads."	44

Answer:

Jani has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jani has 3 x 2 = 6 pets.

Of the 200 fifth graders, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?

Answer: 30

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* 2/5 of the boys are Girl Scouts (2/5 \* 50 = 20)
* 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts (2/3 \* 100 = 66)

Now, we can find the total number of Girl Scouts by adding the number of boys and girls who are Girl Scouts:

20 + 66 = 86

So, there are 86 Girl Scouts.

To find the number of girls who are not in Girl Scouts, we can subtract the number of Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

100 - 86 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 girls who are not in Girl Scouts."	30

Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science reading book, 20 pages from his Social studies book, 7 pages from his History book and 8 pages from his Geography book.Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 days left to finish reading everything, how many pages does he have to read on average in one day?

Answer: 

To find out how many pages Solo has to read on average in one day, we need to divide the total number of pages he has to read by the number of days he has left to finish reading.

Total number of pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49
Number of days left = 4

To find out how many pages Solo has to read on average in one day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left:

Average pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
= 49 / 4
= 12

So, Solo has to read an average of 12 pages per day to finish reading all his books within 4 days."	4

It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If a city extends 42 miles from sea to shore, how many minutes does it take for the fog to cover the entire city?

I'm having trouble with this problem because I don't understand how to approach it. Can you help me?

Thank you!

Answer:

To solve this problem, we can use the information that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. This means that for every 3 miles, the fog takes 10 minutes to cover.

Since the city extends 42 miles from sea to shore, we can calculate the total time it takes for the fog to cover the entire city by multiplying the distance by the time per mile:

42 miles x 10 minutes/3 miles = 42 x 3 = 126 minutes

Therefore, it takes 126 minutes (or 2 hours and 6 minutes) for the fog to cover the entire city."	6

Frankie watches TV after homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday he watches his favorite one-hour program every night. On Wednesday he watches shorter 30-minute programs. On Thursday he finished his homework early and watched a one-hour program every 30 minutes. On Friday he stayed late because it was the weekend and watched two one-hour programs each. If he watched all 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute programs did he watch?

Let x be the number of 30-minute programs Frankie watched on Wednesday.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched one-hour programs, so he watched no 30-minute programs on those days.

On Wednesday, Frankie watched x 30-minute programs.

On Thursday, Frankie watched one-hour programs every 30 minutes, so he watched 2 x 30-minute programs.

On Friday, Frankie watched two one-hour programs, so he watched 2 x 1 hour = 2 hours of 30-minute programs.

In total, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV. Since he watched no 30-minute programs on Monday and Tuesday, and 2 x 30-minute programs on Thursday, the number of 30-minute programs he watched is:

7 hours - (1 hour x 2 days) - (2 x 30 minutes) = 7 hours - 2 hours - 2 x 30 minutes = 7 hours - 2 hours - 60 minutes = 5 hours

Therefore, Frankie watched 5 hours of 30-minute programs."	30

Henry is making cookies for a local cooking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he made last year. When he finishes cooking, he finds that he has baked 15 more cookies than he thought he would. He drops 5 cookies when he takes them out to cool, so now he has 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he bakes 2x cookies this year.

He thinks he will bake x + 5 cookies, but he actually bakes 15 more than that, so he bakes x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies in total.

So we can set up the equation:

x + (2x + 15) - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 10 = 110

Solving for x:

3x = 110 - 10
3x = 100

x = 33

So Henry baked 33 cookies last year."	33

Beatrice has 2 widths of 24 roll-ups, so she has 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.
Marcell has 3 widths of 14 roll-ups, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.
In total, there are 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.
However, they only have 90 - 8 = 82 roll-ups, so they ate 8 roll-ups in the middle."	8

Sasha finds that lumber prices have risen by 50% in recent months after buying lumber. Since she has an instrument she has decided to sell. She has ten sets of 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4x4x10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit will she make?

Answer: 
Sasha will make a profit of $340.

Explanation:

2x4x10 boards x 10 sets = 10 x $10 = $100
4x4x10 boards x 5 sets = 5 x $16 = $80
Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $100 + $80 - $180

The Customs officer at the port of Sea side clearances counted 2 shipping containers of imported vehicles, each container containing 5 vehicles. The next day more containers were brought in, bringing the total number of vehicles at the port to 30. Find out how many shipping containers were imported on the second day on the assumption that each container contained 5 vehicles.

Answer: 6 containers.

Explanation:
If each container contained 5 vehicles and 2 containers were imported on the first day, then 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles were imported on the first day.
On the second day, 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were imported. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, 20 / 5 = 4 containers were imported on the second day.
However, we are also given that 6 containers were imported on the second day. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 containers."	6

Adrien's total earnings are 30% higher than Lylah's. The next four years her earnings have increased if she earns 40% more than she earned in the previous four years. If Adrien and Lylah's earnings increased at the same time, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, find the total earnings of the couple in the next four years?

Answer:

Lylah's earnings four years ago were $20,000.

Adrien's earnings four years ago were $40,000.

Lylah's current earnings are $28,000 (40% more than $20,000).

Adrien's current earnings are $56,000 (30% more than $40,000).

Total earnings of the couple in the next four years:

Lylah's earnings: $28,000 x 4 = $112,000

Adrien's earnings: $56,000 x 4 = $224,000

Total earnings of the couple in the next four years: $112,000 + $224,000 = $336,000."	336000
120	Miguel uses two sheets of paper to draw each week. if there are 30 sheets in a paper book, how many sheets are needed to be used in a month.	240	"Answer only. 
Miguel uses two sheets of paper to draw each week. if there are 30 sheets in a paper book, how many sheets are needed to be used in a month.

Answer: 12 sheets of paper.

Explanation:

* There are 30 sheets in a paper book.
* Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week.
* There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, to calculate the total number of sheets needed in a month, we multiply the number of sheets in a book by the number of weeks in a month:

30 sheets/book x 4 weeks/month = 120 sheets/month

Since Miguel uses two sheets per week, he will need 12 sheets in a month (120 sheets / 2 sheets per week)."	2
121	Morisette brought five apples and eight oranges, while Kael brought twice as many apples as Morsette and half as many oranges as Mossette.	27	"Answer only. 
Morisette brought five apples and eight oranges, while Kael brought twice as many apples as Morsette and half as many oranges as Mossette.

How many apples and oranges did they bring in total?

I can do this one.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so that's 5 + 8 = 13 apples and oranges total.

Kael brought 2 times 5 = 10 apples, and half of 8 = 4 oranges, so Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 apples and oranges total.

In total, then, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 14 = 27 apples and oranges."	27

A hospital sees 500 patients a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. Children's doctors charge $150 an hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these patient visits?

Answer: $350,000 per day.

Explanation:

Total patient visits per day = 500

Average time per visit = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours

Total time spent by patients per day = 500 x 0.4 = 200 hours

Total revenue generated per day = 200 hours x $200 per hour = $40,000

Total expenses per day = 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue - Total expenses
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day from these patient visits."	10000

Nissa hires 60 workers each season to work as carpenters in her local Santa shop. A third of the carpenters leave work by vomiting, the remaining 10 carpenters leave work by hiding in the pot. How many carpenters are left?

Answer: 40 carpenters are left.

Explanation:

* A third of the carpenters (60 x 1/3) = 20 carpenters leave work by vomiting.
* Remaining carpenters (60 - 20) = 40 carpenters.
* 10 carpenters hide in the pot, so the total number of carpenters left is 40."	40

Pam and Fred went for a ride. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred rode it four times, and then each of them decided to ride the luge twice. If each ride cost six tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?

Answer: 24 tickets.

Explanation:

* Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.
* Fred rode the roller coaster four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.
* Both Pam and Fred rode the luge twice, so they used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets each, for a total of 24 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day was 12 + 24 = 24 tickets."	24

Tom washes the car four times a month. If one car wash costs $15, how much does he pay annually?

Answer: $600.

Explanation:

To find out how much Tom pays annually, we need to multiply the number of car washes he does per month by the cost of one car wash.

4 car washes per month x $15 per car wash = $60 per month

$60 per month x 12 months = $600 per year"	600

Brian's friend Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian has three times as many. If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison, how many does Bobby have?

I need to solve this problem using algebra. I've tried a few different approaches, but I keep getting stuck or ending up with the wrong answer. Can you help me figure out how to solve this problem?

Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this problem! Here's how we can approach it using algebra:

Let's start by identifying what we know:

1. Brian has 20 video games.
2. Brian lost 5 video games before the comparison.
3. Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian.

Now, let's think about how we can use algebra to represent this information. We can let X be the number of video games Bobby has. Since Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian, we can write:

X = 5(20 - 5)

Now, we need to simplify this expression. We can start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

20 - 5 = 15

So, X = 5(15) = 75

Therefore, Bobby has 75 video games.

I hope this helps! Do you have any other questions about this problem or algebra in general?"	75

Rory orders two soaps for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each to be delivered to her. There is a 29% surcharge on delivery and she wants an extra $5.00 handbag. How much does it cost to deliver the items she ordered?

Answer:

Total cost of items ordered = 2 x $7.50 + 2 x $1.50 + 2 x $1.00 = $19.00

Delivery surcharge = 29% of $19.00 = $5.21

Total cost of delivery = $19.00 + $5.21 = $24.21

Extra $5.00 handbag = $5.00

Total cost = $24.21 + $5.00 = $29.21"	29

John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and antiseptic for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, how much are all his purchases worth?

Answer: $19.

Explanation:

1. Milk: $2 x 1 = $2
2. Eggs: $3 x 1 = $3
3. Light bulbs: $3 x 1 = $3
4. Cups: $3 x 1 = $3
5. Antiseptic: $4 x 1 = $4

Total cost before tax: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

10% tax on non-food items: $15 x 10% = $1.50

Total cost after tax: $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

Therefore, all his purchases are worth $16.50."	16

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every three months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?

Answer:

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate how many harvests he can have in a year. Since he can harvest every three months, he can have 4 harvests in a year (3 x 4 = 12 months).

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1,000 pineapples/hectare

1,000 pineapples/hectare x 4 harvests/year = 4,000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4,000 pineapples in a year."	4000

Jonny is picking up toys on the floor of his house. He has thrown a Lego box with 500 movable parts on the floor, one with three times the number of movable parts and the other with a quarter of the number of movable parts. How many boxes does Jonny pick up if he collects all the Lego pieces?

Solve this problem using the concept of equivalent ratios.

Answer:

If Jonny collects all the Lego pieces, he will pick up 3 boxes with 500 movable parts each, for a total of 1500 movable parts.

Explanation:

Let's say Jonny has x boxes with 500 movable parts each. Since one box has three times the number of movable parts, Jonny has 3x boxes with 500 movable parts each.

If another box has a quarter of the number of movable parts, it has 500/4 = 125 movable parts. So, Jonny has 125 boxes with 125 movable parts each.

Since Jonny collects all the Lego pieces, he will pick up a total of 3x + 125 = 1500 movable parts."	1500

151	Shawnda thinks that the children of her neighbors might need to have their bikes parked. She thinks that overcharging for a tire is the best way. One tire costs 25 cents to park. The first day 5 people came to park their two wheels. 3 people came to park their tricycle wheels. Finally one person comes to park his one-wheeled bike. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Answer only. 
Shawnda thinks that the children of her neighbors might need to have their bikes parked. She thinks that overcharging for a tire is the best way. One tire costs 25 cents to park. The first day 5 people came to park their two wheels. 3 people came to park their tricycle wheels. Finally one person comes to park his one-wheeled bike. How many dollars did he make that day?

Please help me with this question. Thank you.

Comment:
I think this is a classic example of a ""brain teaser"" type of question, and it's not intended to be solved using mathematical formulas or calculations. Instead, it's meant to be a puzzle that requires creative thinking and lateral reasoning.

Here's my solution:

Shawnda is trying to charge each child a fee for parking their bikes. However, she's not charging them based on the number of wheels their bikes have. Instead, she's charging them based on the number of letters in the name of their bikes.

So, the first child who parked their bike with two wheels paid 25 cents, because ""two"" has two letters. The next child who parked their tricycle with three wheels paid 25 cents, because ""three"" has three letters. And the final child who parked their one-wheeled bike paid 25 cents, because ""one"" has one letter.

In total, Shawnda made $25 cents + $25 cents + $25 cents = $75 cents that day.

Please let me know if this is the correct solution, or if there's a different way to approach it."	75
152	Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. One packet of cookies has six cookies inside. One cookie costs $0.10. Does Carl get change for how much he bought for $10 combined?	4	"Answer only. 
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. One packet of cookies has six cookies inside. One cookie costs $0.10. Does Carl get change for how much he bought for $10 combined?

Answer: $1.60

How do you calculate that?

Answer:

First, calculate the total cost of the cookies:

10 packs x 6 cookies per pack = 60 cookies

60 cookies x $0.10 per cookie = $6.00

Since Carl paid $10, he should get $10 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.

Therefore, Carl gets $4.00 in change."	4

Dave buys a large bag of French fries and eats fourteen before being snatched away by a hungry seagull. Upon landing, the seagull eats half as many as Dave has eaten. Three cockroaches also come and chase him from his diet, each cockroach eating three potatoes. Later, a raccoon steals one-third of the remaining potatoes. Ants carry one remaining potato, leaving five. How many French fries were in the bag that Dave bought?

Answer: 17

Explanation:

Dave ate 14 French fries, so there were 17 - 14 = 3 French fries left in the bag.

The seagull ate half as many as Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 French fries.

The three cockroaches each ate 3 French fries, so the cockroaches ate 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.

The raccoon stole one-third of the remaining potatoes, so the raccoon stole 3 x (17 - 9) = 3 x 8 = 24 French fries.

Therefore, there were 3 - 24 = 5 French fries left in the bag."	5

Bill bakes 300 pancakes, 120 croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. One pancake is four feet long, one croissant is six feet long, and one baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to put all the pancakes in a row, how many feet long would they be?

Hint: You need to convert each item to a common unit before adding them.

Answer:

To find the total length of all the pancakes, we need to convert each pancake to a common unit. Since one pancake is four feet long, we can say that:

1 pancake = 4 feet

Now, let's convert the number of pancakes to the same unit:

300 pancakes = 300 x 4 feet = 1200 feet

Now, we can add the lengths of all the pancakes:

1200 feet + 1200 feet + 1200 feet = 3600 feet

So, if Bill were to put all the pancakes in a row, they would be 3600 feet long."	3600

160	The water tank is 17 feet deep on Monday. Secondly, the tank had an excess of 7 feet of water. On Wednesday, the water was one-third of what it was on Tuesday. How deep is the tank on Wednesday?	16	"Answer only. 
The water tank is 17 feet deep on Monday. Secondly, the tank had an excess of 7 feet of water. On Wednesday, the water was one-third of what it was on Tuesday. How deep is the tank on Wednesday?

Answer: 10 feet

Explanation:

Let the initial depth of water in the tank be x feet.

On Monday, the tank is 17 feet deep, so x + 7 = 17.

On Tuesday, the tank has one-third of the water it had on Monday, so the depth of water is x/3.

On Wednesday, the tank has one-third of the water it had on Tuesday, so the depth of water is (x/3)/3 = x/9.

Since the tank is 10 feet deep on Wednesday, we have x/9 = 10, so x = 90.

Therefore, the tank is 90 feet deep on Monday and 10 feet deep on Wednesday."	10

Jackie is considering whether to do her own taxes or hire a trained accountant to do it for her. If she does these taxes on her own, she could lose three hours of self-employment, costing her $35 an hour in salary. A professional accountant costs $90.

What is the break-even point where it would be more cost-effective to hire an accountant?

Answer: 

To determine the break-even point, we need to calculate the cost of doing the taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring an accountant.

Cost of doing taxes herself:

3 hours x $35/hour = $105

Cost of hiring an accountant:

$90

To break even, the cost of doing the taxes herself must be less than or equal to the cost of hiring an accountant.

$105 (cost of doing taxes herself) < $90 (cost of hiring an accountant)

Therefore, the break-even point is 6 hours of self-employment income. If Jackie earns more than 6 hours of self-employment income, it would be more cost-effective to hire an accountant. If she earns less than 6 hours, she should do her own taxes."	6

Explanation:

Total cost of computer and accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Subtract the total cost from the budget: €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira has €77 left over to buy her dress."	77

Jessica is trying to figure out how to pay off all her bills each month. Her student loans are at least $300 a month, her credit card is at least $200 a month, and her mortgage is at least $500 a month. If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the mortgage, how much does she pay per year?

Answer: $13,000

Explanation:

To calculate the total amount Jessica pays per year, we need to add up the monthly payments for all her bills.

Mortgage: $500 x 12 = $6,000 per year
Student loans: $300 x 12 = $3,600 per year
Credit card: $200 x 12 = $2,400 per year

Total: $6,000 + $3,600 + $2,400 = $13,000 per year

If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the mortgage, she would pay:

$6,000 + (50% of $6,000) = $6,000 + $3,000 = $13,000 per year."	13000

Two candidates are competing to represent a class at a school in Sarai. If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes which the total number of schoolchildren who voted in the class was 80, find the number of votes the loser got.

Let X be the number of votes the loser got.

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the winner got 80/4 = 20 votes more than the loser.

So, the winner got 80 + 20 = 100 votes.

Since the loser got less than 100 votes, the loser got X votes.

We can set up the equation:

X + 20 = 100

Solving for X, we get:

X = 80

What is the probability that Jerry rolls a six-sided die? What is the probability that he rolls more than three numbers than that he rolls the same number twice in a row?

Hint: Roll a six-sided die 10 times and count the number of times you roll each number.

Answer:

To find the probability that Jerry rolls a six-sided die, we need to divide the number of successful outcomes (rolling a six) by the total number of outcomes.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

So, the probability of rolling a six is:

6/6 = 1

To find the probability that Jerry rolls more than three numbers than that he rolls the same number twice in a row, we need to count the number of times he rolls each number and compare it to the number of times he rolls the same number twice in a row.

Let's roll a six-sided die 10 times and count the number of times we roll each number:

Roll 1: 3
Roll 2: 4
Roll 3: 5
Roll 4: 2
Roll 5: 6
Roll 6: 3
Roll 7: 4
Roll 8: 5
Roll 9: 2
Roll 10: 6

Now, let's count the number of times Jerry rolls the same number twice in a row:

There are 3 pairs of consecutive numbers:

3-4, 5-6, and 2-3.

So, the probability that Jerry rolls the same number twice in a row is:

3/10 = 0.3

To find the probability that Jerry rolls more than three numbers than that he rolls the same number twice in a row, we need to subtract the probability that he rolls the same number twice in a row from 1:

1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So, the probability that Jerry rolls more than three numbers than that he rolls the same number twice in a row is:"	0

188	A buyer buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry a sack from the field to the warehouse, this buyer made a profit of $400 by selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A buyer buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry a sack from the field to the warehouse, this buyer made a profit of $400 by selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 120 sacks

Explanation:

Let x be the number of sacks sold.

Since the buyer made a profit of $400, the total revenue (TR) must be greater than the total cost (TC):

TR = 30x + 20(x) = 30x + 20x = 50x

TC = 2x + 20x = 22x

Profit = TR - TC = 50x - 22x = 28x

Since the profit is $400, we know that:

28x = 400

Solving for x, we get:

x = 120

So the buyer sold 120 sacks of wheat."	120

They also went to 2 different equestrian events for $33 each. If they agreed to split all their expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Answer only. 
Three friends spent $20.25 to buy 3 entrance tickets to the game. They also spent $4.50 less than they spent on all the tickets for food. They also went to 2 different equestrian events for $33 each. If they agreed to split all their expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?

Answer:

Each of the three friends paid $20.25 + $33 = $53.25 for the game and equestrian events.

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the cost of the game tickets. They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets, so each ticket cost $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less than they spent on all the tickets, so they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the game and equestrian events. They spent $20.25 on game tickets and $15.75 on food, for a total of $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Since they agreed to split all their expenses equally, each of the three friends paid $36.00 / 3 = $53.25 for the game and equestrian events."	53

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Each year he also cuts down two trees a year. He starts with 50 trees, after 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. Each year he also cuts down two trees a year. He starts with 50 trees, after 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?

I can't use the formula for compound growth because it is not a compound growth problem.

Answer: 

After 10 years, there will be 50 x 10 = 500 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees will die, so 500 x 0.3 = 150 trees will die.

So, after 10 years, there will be 500 - 150 = 350 trees left."	350

In the third month, he has collected twice the number of Pokémon cards he collected in the first and second months combined. How many Pokémon cards has he now collected altogether?

Answer: 60 Pokémon cards.

Explanation:

In the first month, Eklaine collected 20 Pokémon cards, so he had 20 cards.

In the second month, he collected 3 times 20 = 60 cards, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, he collected twice 40 = 80 cards, so he had 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

Therefore, Eklaine has collected 120 Pokémon cards altogether."	120

Twenty dozen cups at $1,200 is less than the total cost of half a dozen bowls at $6,000 each.

How much is the cost of one bowl?

Answer: $6,000.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the given information:

20 dozen cups = 240 cups (20 x 12)

$1,200 / 240 cups = $5 per cup

Half a dozen bowls = 3 bowls (6 / 2 = 3)

$6,000 / 3 bowls = $2,000 per bowl

Therefore, the cost of one bowl is $2,000."	2000

Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and a pair of shoes. 2 The jacket she likes costs $30 and a pair of shoes $20. Sara takes care of her neighbor's children four times for $5 each time she takes care of them. Her parents give her $4 each for mowing the lawn. If Sara has $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to buy a jacket and shoes?

Answer:
Sara needs to mow the lawn 4 times to buy a jacket and shoes.

Explanation:
Sara has $10 saved before she started babysitting, so she has a total of $10 + $4 = $14.
The jacket costs $30, so she needs to earn $30 - $14 = $16 more to buy the jacket.
The shoes cost $20, so she needs to earn $20 - $14 = $6 more to buy the shoes.
Since Sara earns $5 each time she takes care of her neighbor's children, she needs to take care of them 4 times (4 x $5 = $20) to earn enough money to buy both the jacket and the shoes."	20

At the dollar store, Sloane counts the customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than on the first day. if the total on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?

Answer: 550

Explanation:

Let's say Sloane counted x customers on the first day.

On the second day, he counted 50 more customers, so he counted x + 50 customers.

On the third day, he counted 500 customers, so he counted (x + 50) + 500 customers.

Combine like terms:

(x + 50) + 500 = 550

Simplify:

2x + 50 + 500 = 550

Solve for x:

2x + 50 = 550 - 500

2x = 350

x = 175

So, Sloane counted 175 customers on the first day, 175 + 50 = 225 customers on the second day, and 225 + 500 = 550 customers on the third day."	550

Jerry has two pools of water, each with holes that discharge water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, now the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have?

Answer: 2 gallons.

Explanation:
Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water initially. Since the big pool had twice as much water, the big pool had 2x gallons of water initially.

4 minutes ago, the big pool lost 4 gallons of water, so it now has 2x - 4 gallons of water.
The small pool lost 4 gallons of water as well, so it now has x - 4 gallons of water.

Since the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool now, the small pool has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

We know that 2x - 4 = 2, so x = 2.

Therefore, the small pool has 2 gallons of water."	2

If she were to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over during those 12 months?

Answer: $1,980

Explanation:

To find out how much money Janet would have left over after paying $165 per month for 12 months, we need to subtract the total amount she paid ($1,980) from the total amount she received ($2,100).

$2,100 - $1,980 = $120

So, Janet would have $120 left over after paying $165 per month for 12 months."	12

James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 hammer cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 hammer cards, what is the percent chance (counted to the nearest whole number) that any card he picks up is water?

Hint: Calculate the probability of picking up a water card first.

Answer: 20%

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the probability of picking up a water card.

There are 40 water cards in total, and after losing 8, there are 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.

So, the probability of picking up a water card is:

32/70 = 1/2

Now, we need to calculate the probability of picking up any card that is not a water card.

There are 30 fire cards and 20 hammer cards in total, and after buying 14 hammer cards, there are 30 + 20 + 14 = 64 cards left.

So, the probability of picking up any card that is not a water card is:

64/70 = 4/5

Now, we need to find the probability of picking up a water card or any card that is not a water card.

We can use the following formula:

Probability of A or B = Probability of A + Probability of B

where A is the event of picking up a water card, and B is the event of picking up any card that is not a water card.

So, the probability of picking up a water card or any card that is not a water card is:

Probability of A or B = (1/2) + (4/5) = (1/2) + 4/5 = 20/50

Therefore, the percent chance (counted to the nearest whole number) that any card James picks up is water is:

20/50 x 100% = 40%

So, the answer is 40%."	40

Chad bought a burrito for lunch. The bottom portion of the burrito is $6.50. He adds a steak for $2.00, a cheese for $1.00, a quarter for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each. He plans to add $3.00 to his meal by adding chips and drinks. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses when he leaves. How much money does he still have to pay?

Answer:

$5.00 (gift card) + $3.00 (chips and drinks) = $8.00

Total cost of meal: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 + $0.25 = $12.90

Balance: $8.00 - $12.90 = -$4.90

Therefore, Chad still has to pay $4.90."	4

229	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30% of the milk was ripe, so she took it home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe, so she harvested it. After two weeks, how many milks were not ready to be harvested?	21	"Answer only. 
Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30% of the milk was ripe, so she took it home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe, so she harvested it. After two weeks, how many milks were not ready to be harvested?

Answer: 
There were 30% of the milk that was ripe two months later, so 30% of the total milk was ripe.
30% of the milk that was ripe two months later is 30% of 30% of the total milk, which is 9% of the total milk.
3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe two weeks later, so 3/4 of the total milk minus 9% of the total milk was not ready to be harvested.

Therefore, after two weeks, 3/4 of the total milk minus 9% of the total milk, which is 3/4 x 90% - 9% of the total milk, was not ready to be harvested.

So, after two weeks, 61% of the total milk was not ready to be harvested.

Therefore, the answer is 61%."	61
230	Mark buys 12 of his company's cars. Each car costs $20,000. He pays 10% of the car's tax and another $1000 for the registration of each of them. What does he pay in total?	276,000	"Answer only. 
Mark buys 12 of his company's cars. Each car costs $20,000. He pays 10% of the car's tax and another $1000 for the registration of each of them. What does he pay in total?

I can do this problem, but I'm not sure how to explain it to someone else. Can you help?

Answer:

First, calculate the tax on each car:

12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000 (total cost)

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000 (tax)

Next, calculate the registration cost for each car:

12 cars x $1000 per car = $12,000 (registration cost)

Total cost = $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration cost) = $36,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $36,000 for the 12 cars."	12
231	On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20. On Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday.	50	"Answer only. 
On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20. On Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday.

How many shells will Kylie collect on Tuesday?

Let's use ""K"" to represent the number of shells Kyle collects on Monday, and ""K2"" to represent the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.

We know that Kyle collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kyle collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

We also know that Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so Kylie collects 25 x 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

Therefore, Kylie will collect 50 shells on Tuesday."	50

If, at the end of the meeting, 30% of the children left on day A, 3/5 of the remaining children left on day B, and all the remaining children left on day C, find the number of children who left on day C.

Let X be the number of children who left on day C.

We know that 30% of the children left on day A, so 30% of X left on day A.

We also know that 3/5 of the remaining children left on day B, so 3/5 of (X - 30%) left on day B.

Finally, we know that all the remaining children left on day C, so X - (30% + 3/5) = 0.

Solve for X to find the number of children who left on day C."	0

Mike used to correspond with 5 people. He stopped associating with 2 of them. Each of them wrote 2 letters a week of 5 pages. He responds freely. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Let's say Mike stopped corresponding with Alice and Bob.

So, he is left with 3 people to correspond with: Carol, David, and Emily.

Each of them writes 2 letters a week, of 5 pages each.

Mike responds freely, so he writes a page in 6 minutes.

Let's calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:

1. Carol: 2 letters x 5 pages/letter x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes/letter x 2 letters/week = 120 minutes/week
2. David: 2 letters x 5 pages/letter x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes/letter x 2 letters/week = 120 minutes/week
3. Emily: 2 letters x 5 pages/letter x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes/letter x 2 letters/week = 120 minutes/week

Total time spent writing per week:
120 minutes + 120 minutes + 120 minutes = 360 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours/week writing."	6
243	Jason has a 1,000-minute monthly phone schedule. He has 15 minutes a day to talk to his boss and another 300 minutes this month to talk to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"Answer only. 
Jason has a 1,000-minute monthly phone schedule. He has 15 minutes a day to talk to his boss and another 300 minutes this month to talk to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?

Answer: Jason has 650 minutes left this month.

To calculate this, you need to subtract the total minutes Jason has already used (15 minutes x 30 days + 300 minutes) from the total minutes available this month (1,000 minutes).

15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes
750 minutes - 1,000 minutes = 650 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 650 minutes left this month."	650

Griffin had 24 shots, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin some of his shots, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 shots less than Kyle's total. If Griffin ended up with 27 shots, how many shots did Ginger give Griffin?

Let G = the number of shots Ginger gave Griffin

Let K = the number of shots Kyle took

Let B = the number of shots Billy took

Let C = the number of shots Colby gave Griffin

We know that:

G + K + B + C = 27 (total number of shots)

We also know that:

K = 5

B = 2K = 2(5) = 10

C = 3K = 3(5) = 15

So, we can write:

G + 5 + 10 + 15 = 27

Simplifying, we get:

G = 7

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 7 shots."	7
245	There are 4 reefs in the aquarium and 32 in the aquarium, The difference in the number of reefs in the two areas is twice the number of fish in the two areas. If the aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each area?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 reefs in the aquarium and 32 in the aquarium, The difference in the number of reefs in the two areas is twice the number of fish in the two areas. If the aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each area?

Answer:
There are 32 fish in each area.

Explanation:
Let's say there are x fish in one aquarium and x fish in the other aquarium. Since there are 4 reefs in one aquarium and 32 in the other, the difference in the number of reefs is twice the number of fish.

So, we can set up the equation:

4 - 32 = 2(x - x)

Simplifying the equation:

4 - 32 = 2x - 2x

Solving for x:

4 - 32 = 2x

x = 32

Therefore, there are 32 fish in each aquarium."	32

A person who makes jeans for his face charges $250 an hour. He needs expensive make-up for a movie that he's taking six hours to make four times a week. The movie takes five weeks to complete. After the movie the person who makes jeans takes 10% off depending on the work done. How much did Jean pay?

Hint: You need to calculate the total amount paid by Jean.

Answer:

To calculate the total amount paid by Jean, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the person who makes jeans for his face, and then multiply it by the hourly rate.

Total number of hours worked = 6 hours/week x 4 weeks x 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total amount paid by Jean = $250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000

After the movie, the person who makes jeans takes 10% off, so the final amount paid by Jean would be:

$30,000 x 90% = $27,000"	27000

On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her brother; on Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies; her brother ate five cookies on Monday and 13 the next day; if one cookie contained 200 calories, how much more did Sue eat?

Answer:

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her brother on Monday, so she ate 4x = 4 \* 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as she ate on Monday, so she ate 2x = 2 \* 20 = 40 cookies.

Her brother ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day, so he ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

The total number of calories in the cookies is 200 per cookie, so the total number of calories eaten by Sue on Monday is 20 \* 200 = 4000 calories, and the total number of calories eaten by Sue on Tuesday is 40 \* 200 = 8000 calories.

The total number of calories eaten by Sue's brother is 18 \* 200 = 3600 calories.

Therefore, Sue ate 8000 - 3600 = 4400 more calories than her brother."	4400
