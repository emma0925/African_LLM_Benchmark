Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three a day every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day for four. She sells leftovers at the farmers' market every day for $2 for a good duck egg. How many dollars does she make a day at the farmers' market?

Answer: $6.

Explanation:

* Janet eats 3 eggs a day, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
* She bakes muffins for 4 days, so she uses 13 x 4 = 52 eggs.
* She sells 52 - 3 = 49 eggs at the farmers' market.
* At $2 per egg, she makes 49 x $2 = $98.

Therefore, Janet makes $98 per day at the farmers' market."	98

7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB per minute, but once she's at 40% download, Windows restarts to install the updated operating system, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start downloading from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Answer only. 
Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB per minute, but once she's at 40% download, Windows restarts to install the updated operating system, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start downloading from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?

A) 20 minutes
B) 40 minutes
C) 60 minutes
D) 80 minutes

Hint: Calculate the time it takes to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute.

Answer: C) 60 minutes

Explanation:

To download a 200 GB file at 2 GB/minute, it would take:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Since Carla has to restart her computer and start downloading from scratch after the Windows update, she will need to spend an additional 20 minutes (the time it takes to install the updated operating system). Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

So the correct answer is C) 60 minutes."	60

The new edition has 60 downloads in the first month.The number of downloads in the second month tripled the number of downloads in the first month, but fell by 30% in the third month.How many downloads in this edition, say a total of three months?

Answer:

Let X be the number of downloads in the first month.

According to the problem, the number of downloads in the second month is 3 times the number of downloads in the first month, so:

X + 3X = 60 + 3(60) = 60 + 180 = 240

We know that the number of downloads in the third month fell by 30%, so:

240 - (30% of 240) = 240 - 72 = 168

Therefore, the total number of downloads in the three months is 168."	168

12	Carlos has planted a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 a plant. Each year it will produce 7 oranges that can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos has planted a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 a plant. Each year it will produce 7 oranges that can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?

Answer: 6 years.

Explanation:

Cost of planting the tree = $90
Yearly maintenance cost = $3

Total cost = $90 + $3 = $93

Number of oranges produced per year = 7
Price of each orange = $1.5

Total revenue per year = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5

Yearly profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $10.5 - $93
= -$82.5 (loss)

To break even, the tree must produce enough oranges to cover the total cost of planting and maintenance.

Number of years to break even = Total cost / Yearly profit
= $93 / (-$82.5)
= 6 years

Therefore, it will take 6 years for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree."	6

I can't seem to get the correct answer. Please help!

Here's what I have:

50 weeks x 35 hours/week = 1750 hours/year (teaching)
1750 hours/year x $40/hour = $68,000/year (teaching)

19	Marissa walks 12 miles. It took her one hour to walk 4 miles, another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) she needs to travel the remaining distance?	6	"Answer only. 
Marissa walks 12 miles. It took her one hour to walk 4 miles, another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) she needs to travel the remaining distance?

Answer: 3 miles per hour. 

Explanation: 

Let's first find out how long it takes Marissa to walk the remaining distance of 8 miles (12 - 4).

If she walks at a constant speed of x miles per hour, it will take her:

x hours to walk 8 miles

We know that she walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour for the first 4 miles, so we can set up the equation:

x = 4

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the remaining 8 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

If she walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, it will take her:

3 hours to walk 8 miles

Therefore, Marissa needs to travel the remaining distance of 8 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour."	4
20	I have 10 quarts of orange juice and I want to add 15 quarts of pineapple juice. But when I poured them, I spilled 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 quarts of orange juice and I want to add 15 quarts of pineapple juice. But when I poured them, I spilled 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?

I'm sorry, but the question doesn't make sense. The volume of the orange juice and the pineapple juice are not compatible. Orange juice is a liquid, while pineapple juice is a fruit juice. They cannot be mixed together.

Additionally, the question asks for the amount of water left in 24 liters, but there is no mention of water in the question. It is not possible to determine the amount of water left in 24 liters without knowing the initial volume of water present.

If you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help with, please let me know."	24

23	The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns. How many centimeters short is the candle after burning from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm	8	"Answer only. 
The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns. How many centimeters short is the candle after burning from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm

Answer: 8 cm

Explanation:

The candle burns for 5 hours, from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.

In each hour, the candle melts by 2 cm.

So, the total distance the candle melts in 5 hours is:

5 hours x 2 cm/hour = 10 cm

Therefore, the candle is 8 cm short after burning from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm."	0
24	Kyle bought last year's book for $19.50. This is a 25% discount from the actual price. What is the actual price of the book?	26	"Answer only. 
Kyle bought last year's book for $19.50. This is a 25% discount from the actual price. What is the actual price of the book?

Answer: $25

Explanation:

Let x be the actual price of the book.

Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% less than x.

So, we can set up the equation:

19.50 = x - 0.25x

Simplifying the equation:

19.50 = 0.75x

Solving for x:

x = 25

Therefore, the actual price of the book is $25."	25
25	Marie ordered a chicken meal for $12.5 each, milk packets for $3 each, apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Answer only. 
Marie ordered a chicken meal for $12.5 each, milk packets for $3 each, apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?

Answer: Marie ordered 6 boxes of pizza.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information we know:

1. Chicken meal: $12.5 x 1 = $12.50
2. Milk packets: $3 x 2 = $6
3. Apples: $1.50 x 2 = $3
4. Boxes of pizza: $8.50 x ? = $50

We know that Marie paid a total of $50, so we can set up an equation:

$12.50 + $6 + $3 + x = $50

Where x is the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

Therefore, Marie ordered 6 boxes of pizza."	6

29	Gloria wants to buy shoes when she sees the boots that fit her budget, but she has to choose between the boots and the high heels when together they cost five dollars less than the boots. If the high heels alone cost $33 and the others cost twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?	104	"Answer only. 
Gloria wants to buy shoes when she sees the boots that fit her budget, but she has to choose between the boots and the high heels when together they cost five dollars less than the boots. If the high heels alone cost $33 and the others cost twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?

Answer: $30.

The problem is a classic example of a ""buy one, get one free"" sale. The total cost of the boots and the high heels together is $33 + $30 = $63. Since the boots and the high heels together cost $5 less than the boots alone, the boots must cost $30."	30

Gunter tries to count the beans out of the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80, another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What is the average of their guesses?

I want you to explain your reasoning and show your work.

Hint: You can use the information that the jar contains a total of 100 beans.

Answer:

The first friend says there are 80 beans in the jar.
The second friend says there are 20 more than the first half, which is 80/2 = 40 beans.
The third friend says there are 25% more than the first half, which is 40 x 1.25 = 50 beans.

To find the average of their guesses, we add the three numbers:
80 + 40 + 50 = 170

So, the average of their guesses is 170/3 = 56.67 beans."	56

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes he gets 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he gets 25% more points. How many points did he get in total?

Let X be the number of points Mike got in the first 20 minutes.

We know that X + 25% of X = Total points

Can you help me solve this problem?

Thank you!

I can help you with that! To find the total number of points Mike got, we can use the following steps:

1. Find the number of points Mike got in the first 20 minutes:

X = 40 minutes \* 4 points/20 minutes = 16 points

2. Find 25% of the number of points Mike got in the first 20 minutes:

25% of 16 points = 16 points \* 25/100 = 4 points

3. Add the number of points Mike got in the first 20 minutes and the 25% of the number of points he got in the first 20 minutes to find the total number of points Mike got:

Total points = 16 points + 4 points = 20 points

Therefore, Mike got a total of 20 points playing ping pong for 40 minutes."	40

38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs three and a half hours more on the first day than on the two days he runs. How fast does he run?	10	"Answer only. 
John runs 60 miles a week. He runs three and a half hours more on the first day than on the two days he runs. How fast does he run?

I can help with this problem!

Let's say John runs for x hours on the first day, and for y hours on the other two days.

We know that John runs for a total of 60 miles per week, so he must run for:

60 miles / week = 10 miles / day

We also know that John runs for 3.5 hours more on the first day than on the other two days, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3.5 = y + y + y

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 3.5 = 3y

Now we can solve for x. Can you do that?"	3

* Polly can throw the javelin three times farther without catching the stone.
* The distance Polly can throw the javelin with the stone is 400 yards.
* The dragon's flame is 1000 yards away from Polly.

We can start by finding the distance Polly can throw the javelin without catching the stone. Since she can throw it three times farther, we can multiply the distance she can throw it with the stone by 3:

400 yards x 3 = 1200 yards

So, without catching the stone, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 yards.

Now, we need to find the distance Polly needs to throw the javelin to reach the dragon's flame. We know the dragon's flame is 1000 yards away from Polly, so we subtract the distance Polly can throw the javelin without catching the stone from the distance to the dragon's flame:

1000 yards - 1200 yards = -200 yards

Since the distance to the dragon's flame is negative, it means Polly cannot reach the dragon's flame with the javelin, even if she catches the stone.

Therefore, the answer is: Polly cannot reach the dragon's flame with the"	200

By the end of the day, after the guests have eaten their pies, there are 14 pies left. How many pies have the guests taken?

Answer: 9 pies.

Explanation:

* Grandma Jones bakes 5 apple pies (5 x 8 = 40 pieces).
* She places 5 pies on the dining table (5 x 8 = 40 pieces).
* At the end of the day, there are 14 pies left (5 x 8 = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces).
* The guests have taken 9 pies (14 - 5 = 9 pieces)."	9

According to nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories each. If a 300g bag is eaten 5 times, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have eaten 1800 calories?

Answer: 250 calories x 5 bags = 1250 calories.

Since you have eaten 1800 calories, you would have 550 calories left.

A mechanic charges separately for repairing truck and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic will charge you $60 and for each car tire repaired, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and did not repair truck tires. How much non-profit did the mechanic make on the day of the high profit?

Answer: $120

Explanation:

The mechanic charged $60 for each truck tire repaired, so the total revenue from truck tires on Thursday was 6 x $60 = $360.

The mechanic charged $40 for each car tire repaired, so the total revenue from car tires on Thursday was 4 x $40 = $160.

Total revenue on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic did not repair any truck tires, so the total revenue from car tires was $120 (12 x $10).

Therefore, the non-profit for the day of high profit was $520 - $120 = $400."	400

Doubtfire's sisters drive home with seven kittens they bought from the zoo when their mother calls to tell them that their two cats have added kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has three times as many kittens as they bought while Trixie's other cat has 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family have now?

Answer: 
The Doubtfire family has 25 kittens now.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of kittens the Doubtfire family has.

From the problem, we know that Patchy has three times as many kittens as they bought, so Patchy has 3x kittens.

Trixie's other cat has 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has is:

x + 3x + 12 = 25

Simplifying the equation:

4x + 12 = 25

Solving for x:

4x = 25 - 12

4x = 13

x = 13/4

x = 3

So, the Doubtfire family has 3 + 3 + 12 = 25 kittens."	25

60	A bucket of 25 oranges, of which 1 is bad, 20% is unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?	17	"Answer only. 
A bucket of 25 oranges, of which 1 is bad, 20% is unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?

I'm thinking of a solution that involves a system of linear equations, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Any hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer:

Let G be the number of good oranges, U be the number of unripe oranges, S be the number of sour oranges, and B be the number of bad oranges.

From the problem statement, we know that:

* G + U + S + B = 25 (total number of oranges)
* G + U + S = 20 (percentage of unripe and sour oranges)
* B = 1 (number of bad oranges)

We can now solve the system of equations to find the values of G, U, S, and B.

Solving the first equation for G, we get:

G = 25 - U - S - B

Substituting the values from the second equation, we get:

G = 25 - (20/100) - (2/100) - 1

G = 25 - 2 - 2 - 1

G = 21

Therefore, there are 21 good oranges."	21

65	Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then chooses to go to bed and read half the time. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Answer only. 
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then chooses to go to bed and read half the time. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Let x be the number of hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in one week.

Since Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then chooses to go to bed and read half the time, we can write:

2 hours + (1/2)x = 3 times a week

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 + (1/2)x = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6 hours

So, Jim spends 6 hours watching TV and reading in one week.

Since Jim does this 3 times a week, we can multiply the number of hours he spends in one week by 3 to find out how many hours he spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks:

6 hours/week x 3 weeks = 18 hours

Therefore, Jim spends 18 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks."	4

Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 2x boys.

We know that the total number of students is 60 + 2x.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, we can set up the equation:

60 + 2x = 5x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12

Cecilia has bought a new puppy. According to the veterinarian, she must feed the puppy one cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that she will feed him two cups of dog food every day for the rest of his life. If one bag of dog food has 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Please explain your answer.

Answer:  Cecilia will use 2 bags of dog food in the first year.

Explanation:

In the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day, so Cecilia will use 180 cups of dog food in total. Since one bag of dog food has 110 cups, Cecilia will use half a bag (55 cups) in the first 180 days.

After the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day, so Cecilia will use 2 x 180 = 360 cups of dog food in the remaining 180 days of the first year. Since one bag of dog food has 110 cups, Cecilia will use 3 bags (3 x 110 = 330 cups) of dog food in the first year.

Therefore, Cecilia will use 2 bags of dog food in the first year."	2

If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 more than David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does the laundry by 400 pounds

Answer:

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

David does 4 more than Sarah, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400 + 4 = 404 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

Charlie had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers from a mall store and received 23 for his birthday. Charlie gave his 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. How many stickers do you have left?

Answer: 2.

Explanation:

Charlie had 10 stickers to start with.

He bought 21 stickers from the mall store, so he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers now.

He received 23 stickers for his birthday, so he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers now.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers left.

He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left."	17

Grey has an alarm set to go off three times a day to remind him.If it turns off the alarm, it keeps going off until Greg turns it off.The first time it went off today, it went off four times.The second time it went off three times longer than the first time.The third time it went off half as long as the second time.How many times has the alarm gone off in total?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it went off four times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it went off three times longer than the first time, so it went off for 4 x 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it went off half as long as the second time, so it went off for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

In total, the alarm has gone off 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times."	22

91	Jane has three more pets than Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three of them have?	28	"Answer only. 
Jane has three more pets than Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three of them have?

I can do this problem, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Here's my solution:

Let's say Jane has x pets. Since Jane has three more pets than Marcia, Marcia has x-3 pets.

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Cindy has x-3 - 2 pets.

We know that Cindy has four pets, so we can set up the equation:

x - 3 + 2 = 4

Simplifying the equation:

x = 7

So, Jane has 7 pets, Marcia has 4 pets, and Cindy has 4 pets.

Is this the correct solution? Please let me know if there's anything I need to improve."	4

94	In a neighborhood, the number of pet rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats per dog and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets are there in the neighborhood?	348	"Answer only. 
In a neighborhood, the number of pet rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats per dog and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets are there in the neighborhood?

Answer: 72 pets.

Explanation:
Let X be the number of pet dogs.
Since there are two cats per dog, the number of pet cats is 2X.
The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs and cats:

X + 2X = 60 + 2X

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3X = 60

Solving for X, we get:

X = 20

So, there are 20 pet dogs in the neighborhood.
Since there are twelve less pet rabbits than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, the number of pet rabbits is:

12 less than 20 + 2(20) = 20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, there are 72 pets in the neighborhood."	72
95	Of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are girl scouts. How many girls are not in the scouts?	40	"Answer only. 
Of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are girl scouts. How many girls are not in the scouts?

Answer: 120

Explanation:

Let's first find the total number of girls:

2/5 of the boys + 2/3 of the girls = 2/5(100) + 2/3(100) = 40 + 66 = 106

So, there are 106 girls in total.

Now, we need to find the number of girls who are not in the scouts:

106 - 2/5(100) = 106 - 40 = 66

Therefore, there are 66 girls who are not in the scouts."	66

Answer: 15 cars.

Explanation:

There were 30 cars on the road, and 5 cars pulled out to avoid the traffic jam, leaving 25 cars.

In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars drove past the traffic jam, so there were 20 cars left in the line.

In the remaining 15 minutes, 15 cars drove past the traffic jam, so there were 5 cars left in the line.

Therefore, in total, 15 cars drove past the traffic jam in 15 minutes."	15

Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend pressed the doorbell a quarter more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?

Answer: 120 times.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Jerome's first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. Jerome's second friend pressed the doorbell a quarter more than Jerome's first friend.
3. Jerome's third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's fourth friend.
4. Jerome's fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's start by finding out how many times Jerome's second friend pressed the doorbell:

Jerome's second friend pressed the doorbell a quarter more than Jerome's first friend, so:

20 x 4/4 = 20 x 1 = 20

Jerome's second friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's find out how many times Jerome's third friend pressed the doorbell:

Jerome's third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's fourth friend, so:

60 x 10/4 = 60 x 2.5 = 150

Jerome's third friend pressed the doorbell 150 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell rang:

20 + 150 + 60 = 230

The doorbell rang 230 times."	230

Solo has read 4 pages of Science, 20 pages of Social Studies, 7 pages of his History, and 8 pages of his Geography. He has read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to finish all that he has to read, how many pages does he have to read, on the average, in one day?

Answer:

To find out how many pages Solo has to read on the average in one day, we need to divide the total number of pages he has to read by the number of days he has left to finish them.

Total number of pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49

Number of days left = 4

Average number of pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days left
= 49 / 4
= 12

So, Solo has to read an average of 12 pages per day to finish all his reading in 4 days."	4

Henry bakes the cakes for the local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he has baked 15 more cakes than he intended. He drops 5 cakes when he takes them out to cool off and now has a total of 110 cakes. How many cakes did Henry bake last year?

Answer: Henry baked 20 cakes last year.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of cakes Henry baked last year.

Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he bakes 2x cakes this year.

He intended to bake 2x + 5 cakes this year, but he baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cakes.

Since he has a total of 110 cakes, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 110

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 95

x = 47.5

So, Henry baked 47.5 cakes last year."	47

A local gas station sells gas for $300 a gallon.The utility company offers a $0.20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at the station.If a person buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will the gas be, after the cashback reward?

Answer:
The price of gas after the cashback reward would be $280 per gallon.

Explanation:
The price of gas before the cashback reward is $300 per gallon.
The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so the total amount of cashback is $2 per gallon (10 gallons x $0.20 per gallon).
Therefore, the price of gas after the cashback reward is $300 - $2 = $280 per gallon."	280

111	Julia had a leaky boat when she was on the island. The boat took two liters of water for ten dives and paddled back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to paddle twenty dives. It took 64 seconds to reach shore. How much water did the boat take when Julia reached shore?	16	"Answer only. 
Julia had a leaky boat when she was on the island. The boat took two liters of water for ten dives and paddled back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to paddle twenty dives. It took 64 seconds to reach shore. How much water did the boat take when Julia reached shore?

Answer: 3.2 liters

Explanation:

Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. The boat took two liters of water for ten dives. This means that the boat consumed 2 liters / 10 dives = 0.2 liters per dive.
2. It took Julia 16 seconds to paddle 20 dives. This means that she paddled for 16 seconds / 20 dives = 0.8 seconds per dive.
3. It took 64 seconds to reach shore.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how much water the boat took when Julia reached shore. We know that the boat consumed 0.2 liters per dive, and Julia paddled for 0.8 seconds per dive. So, if we multiply 0.2 liters per dive by 0.8 seconds per dive, we get:

0.2 liters per dive x 0.8 seconds per dive = 0.16 liters per second

Now, we know that it took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore. So, if we multiply 0.16 liters per second by 64 seconds, we get:

0.16 liters per second x 64 seconds = 10.24 liters

Therefore, the boat took 10.24 liters of water when Julia reached shore."	10

Sasha has noticed that the number of boards has increased by 507 in the last few months after she bought a few boards.Since she has some left over, she has decided to sell them, there are ten remaining 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4x4x10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit will she make?

Answer: $1,578.

Explanation:

To find the total cost of the boards, we need to calculate the cost of each type of board and add them up.

10 x 2 x $10 = $200 (2x4x10 boards)
5 x 4 x $16 = $800 (4x4x10 boards)

Total cost = $200 + $800 = $1,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Total cost
= $1,578 - $1,000
= $578

Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $578 if she sells all the boards."	578

On the first day, there were 5 cars in one container, so the total number of cars at the port was 5 + 30 = 35 cars.

On the second day, there were 6 containers, each containing 5 cars, so the total number of cars at the port was 6 x 5 = 30 cars.

Adrien's total salary was 30 percent more than Lylah's. After four years her salary had increased and she was earning 40% more than she did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary both of them were earning in four years.

Answer:

Lylah's salary four years ago was $20,000.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Lylah's current salary is $20,000 + (40% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $8,000 = $28,000.

Adrien's current salary is $40,000 + (30% of $40,000) = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000."	52000

The clinic sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the clinic and at the clinic patients charge $200 an hour. How much profit does the clinic make from visits?

Please provide step-by-step calculations for the profit made by the clinic.

Answer:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Total Revenue = Number of patients x Average time per patient x Charge per hour

Total Cost = Number of patients x Average time per patient x Cost per hour

Profit = 500 x 24 x $150 - 500 x 24 x $200

Profit = $150,000 - $1,000,000

Profit = -$850,000

Therefore, the clinic makes a loss of $850,000."	850000

Rory bought 2 meals for $7.50 each and 2 cakes for $1.00 each to ship. There's a 20% shipping charge added when you're done and a $5.00 tip. How much will it cost to ship the goods?

Answer: $17.50

Explanation:

First, calculate the total cost of the items:

2 meals x $7.50 = $15.00
2 cakes x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $17.00

Next, calculate the shipping charge:

20% of $17.00 = $3.40
Shipping charge = $3.40

Now, add the shipping charge to the total cost:

$17.00 + $3.40 = $20.40

Finally, add the tip:

$20.40 + $5.00 = $25.40

Therefore, it will cost $25.40 to ship the goods."	25

Of the 20 rental cars available, 12 are automatic, 4 have automatic gears, and some cars are automatically changed. What is the percentage of cars that are automatically changed?

I know the answer is 4/20, or 20%, but I'm not sure how to get there.

Can someone please help me?

Thank you!

Answer:

To find the percentage of cars that are automatically changed, you need to first find the number of cars that have automatic gears. This is given as 4.

Then, you can divide the number of cars with automatic gears by the total number of rental cars available, which is 20.

So, the calculation would be:

4 / 20 = 0.2

Or, 20% of the rental cars are automatically changed."	20

Debra monitors a hive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then sees 1/2 of those bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as she saw leave the hive flying away in 6 hours. And other bees left before they returned to the hive in 6 hours. How many bees has Debra seen return in the last 6 hours of the day?

I can't help but think that this is a classic example of a ""trick question"" designed to test my ability to think critically and make logical deductions. Here's my attempt to solve it:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. 1/2 of the bees that left returned in the next 6 hours.
3. Twice as many bees left the hive in the last 6 hours as left in the first 6 hours.
4. Some bees left before they returned to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Now, let's think about what we can deduce from these statements:

1. If 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours, and 1/2 of them returned in the next 6 hours, then 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours (30 x 1/2 = 15).
2. If twice as many bees left the hive in the last 6 hours as left in the first 6 hours, then 60 bees left the hive in the last 6 hours (2 x 30 = 60).
3. If some bees left before they returned to the hive in the last 6 hours, then we can't assume that all 15 bees that returned in the last 6 hours are the same bees that left in the first 6 hours.

So, to answer the question, we can say that Debra has seen 15 bees return in the last 6 hours of the day, but we can't say for certain that these are the same bees that left"	6

Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fried potatoes. The ants carried away the fried potatoes, leaving five behind. How many fried potatoes were in the bag that Dave bought?

Answer:

Let X be the number of fried potatoes in the bag that Dave bought.

Since Dave ate fourteen fried potatoes, X - 14 = 420 (since there were 420 fried potatoes left in the bag after Dave ate fourteen).

The seagull smashed half the number of fried potatoes that Dave had eaten, so the seagull ate 7 (since Dave ate 14 and the seagull ate half of that).

The three pigeons ate three fried potatoes each, so the pigeons ate 9 (since there were 9 fried potatoes left after the seagull ate).

The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fried potatoes, so the raccoon stole 2/3 \* 9 = 6 (since there were 9 fried potatoes left after the pigeons ate).

The ants carried away the fried potatoes, leaving five behind, so there were 5 fried potatoes left in the bag that Dave bought.

Therefore, X = 5."	5

* Baguettes: 60 x 2 = 120 inches

Total: 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

156	The keeper feeds the monkeys. He buys all the bananas from the local farms every two months. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, monkeys need 100 bananas every two months, how many bananas do they need to buy to keep him for 2 months?	1400	"Answer only. 
The keeper feeds the monkeys. He buys all the bananas from the local farms every two months. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, monkeys need 100 bananas every two months, how many bananas do they need to buy to keep him for 2 months?

Answer: The keeper needs to buy 600 bananas to keep the monkeys and gorillas for 2 months.

Explanation:

Monkeys need 200 bananas every two months, so they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas for 2 months.

Gorillas need 400 bananas every two months, so they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas for 2 months.

In total, the keeper needs to buy 400 + 800 = 600 bananas to keep the monkeys and gorillas for 2 months."	2

Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They choose to run 100 meters long on the football field. Blake runs forward 15 times. Kelly runs forward and backward once, and chooses not to run next to Blake anymore, and then starts running 40 meters on the back row. He does this 34 times. How different is the winner's run from the loser's?

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble understanding how to approach it. Thank you!

I'm happy to help! Here's how you can approach this problem:

Let's start by looking at what we know:

* Blake runs forward 15 times for a total distance of 1500 meters (100 meters x 15 times).
* Kelly runs forward and backward once, for a total distance of 200 meters (100 meters x 2 times).
* Kelly then runs 40 meters on the back row, for a total distance of 40 meters.

Now, let's think about how we can compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. We know that Blake ran 1500 meters, and Kelly ran 200 meters + 40 meters = 240 meters.

To find out how different the winner's run is from the loser's, we need to find the difference between 1500 and 240. Can you do that?

Hint: You can use subtraction to find the difference."	240

162	If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price will increase by 20% of its actual value every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price will increase by 20% of its actual value every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Please explain your answer.

I understand that this is a classic example of a compounding interest problem.

So, the price of the bag of marbles will increase by 20% of its actual value every two months, which means that the price will increase by 20% of $20 every two months.

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 2 months will be:

$20 x 1.20 = $24

After 4 months, the price will be:

$24 x 1.20 = $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:

$28.80 x 1.20 = $34.56

After 8 months, the price will be:

$34.56 x 1.20 = $41.47

After 10 months, the price will be:

$41.47 x 1.20 = $49.76

After 12 months, the price will be:

$49.76 x 1.20 = $59.69

After 14 months, the price will be:

$59.69 x 1.20 = $69.62

After 16 months, the price will be:

$69.62 x 1.20 = $82.55

After 18 months, the price will be:

$82.55 x 1.20 = $98.06

After 20 months, the price will be:

$98.06 x 1.20 = $117.67

After 22 months, the price will be:

$117.67 x 1.20 = $141.20

After 24 months, the price will be:

$141."	141

The marching band will apply for a new uniform. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times the value of the hat, and a pair of trousers that cost about half the value of the hat and jacket. How much does a complete uniform cost?

Answer:

Let's call the cost of the hat $x.

The jacket costs three times the hat, so the cost of the jacket is $3x.

The trousers cost half the hat and jacket, so the cost of the trousers is $\frac{x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} = x + 3x = 4x$.

Therefore, the complete uniform costs $x + 4x = 5x$."	5

The potatoes are the same size, it takes the same time to peel and grind each one. It takes Billy a minute and a half to peel, but it is 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take him to prepare the potatoes ?

Answer: 

It will take Billy 2 hours and 45 minutes to prepare the potatoes.

Explanation:

To find out how long it will take Billy to prepare the potatoes, we need to find out how long it will take him to peel and cut the potatoes.

1. Peeling:

There are 60 potatoes to peel, and it takes Billy a minute and a half to peel each potato.

60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Billy will spend 90 minutes peeling the potatoes.

2. Cutting:

There are 60 potatoes to cut, and it takes Billy 5 seconds to cut each potato.

60 potatoes x 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

Billy will spend 300 seconds cutting the potatoes.

Total time:

90 minutes (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 2 hours and 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 2 hours and 45 minutes to prepare the potatoes."	45

184	Jerry rolls a six-sided die. What is the probability (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 rather than rolling two equal numbers in a row?	25	"Answer only. 
Jerry rolls a six-sided die. What is the probability (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 rather than rolling two equal numbers in a row?

Note: You are given that Jerry rolls the die twice.

Answer: 33.33%

Explanation:

Let's consider the two rolls of the die separately:

Roll 1:
There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Since Jerry wants to avoid rolling two equal numbers in a row, he needs to avoid rolling a number that is equal to the previous roll. So, for each number, there is a 50% chance of not rolling that number again.

Probability of not rolling a number equal to the previous roll: 50%
Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% (since there are 3 numbers greater than 3)

So, the probability of not rolling two equal numbers in a row in Roll 1 is:

Probability of not rolling two equal numbers in a row = (50% x 50%) = 25%

Roll 2:
There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Since Jerry has already rolled a number in Roll 1, there are only 5 possible outcomes in Roll 2.

Probability of not rolling two equal numbers in a row in Roll 2:
Probability of not rolling a number equal to the previous roll in Roll 2 = (50% x 25%) = 12.5%

The probability of not rolling two equal numbers in a row in both Rolls 1 and 2 is:

Probability of not rolling two equal numbers in a row in both Rolls 1 and 2 = (12.5% x 25%) = 3.125%

Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 rather than rolling two equal numbers in a row is:

Probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 = 100% - Prob"	100

187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to 2% interest. If Mandy was able to pay after 3 months, how much should she give Benedict?	106	"Answer only. 
Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to 2% interest. If Mandy was able to pay after 3 months, how much should she give Benedict?

Answer: $100 x 2% x 3/12 = $6.00

Explanation:

To find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months.

The interest rate is 2%, so we can calculate the interest as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2%, and the time is 3 months (or 1/4 of a year).

So, the interest is:

Interest = $100 x 2% x 3/12

Interest = $100 x 2% x 3/12

Interest = $6.00

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $100 + $6.00 = $106.00 to settle the debt after 3 months."	3
188	The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 10 sacks.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of sacks sold.

Since the merchant makes a total profit of $400, his revenue from selling the sacks must be:

Revenue = 10 x $30 = $300

And his cost of transporting the sacks must be:

Cost = 10 x $2 = $20

So his total profit is:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $300 - $20 = $280

Since the merchant makes a profit of $400, we know that:

$280 < $400

So, x must be greater than or equal to 10.

Therefore, the merchant sold 10 sacks of wheat."	10

Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 round-trip tickets. They also spent less than $4.50 on food and tickets. They also traveled to two different places that cost $33 each. If they agreed to split the price equally, how much did each person pay?

Answer:

Each person paid $66.50.

Explanation:

Total cost of three round-trip tickets = $20.25 x 3 = $60.75

Total cost of food and tickets = $4.50

Total cost of two places = $33 x 2 = $66

Total cost = $60.75 + $4.50 + $66 = $131.25

Since they agreed to split the cost equally, each person paid $131.25 / 3 = $66.50."	66

Year 2: He cuts down 2 trees, so now he has 60 - 2 = 58 trees.

Year 3: He plants 10 new trees, so now he has 58 + 10 = 68 trees.

Year 4: He cuts down 2 trees, so now he has 68 - 2 = 66 trees.

Year 5: He plants 10 new trees, so now he has 66 + 10 = 76 trees.

Year 6: He cuts down 2 trees, so now he has 76 - 2 = 74 trees.

Year 7: He plants 10 new trees, so now he has 74 + 10 = 84 trees.

Year 8: He cuts down 2 trees, so now he has 84 - 2 = 82 trees.

Year 9: He plants 10 new trees, so now he has 82 + 10 = 92 trees.

Year 10: 30% of the trees die, so now he has 92 - (30/100) \* 92 = 92 - 27.6 = 64.4 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 64.4 trees left."	64
193	On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos outside Sue's yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted white flamingos back outside in front of Sue's yard.

On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos outside Sue's yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted white flamingos back outside in front of Sue's yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. By noon on Sunday, the plastic flamingos were redder than the white plastic flamingos.

How many flamingos were outside Sue's yard in total?

Hint: You can use the information that the neighbors took one third of the flamingos on Saturday morning.

Answer: 42 flamingos.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of flamingos the neighbors placed outside Sue's yard on Friday morning.

We know that on Saturday morning, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, so the number of flamingos outside Sue's yard on Saturday morning is:

x - (1/3)x = x - x/3 = 2x/3

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection, so the total number of flamingos outside Sue's yard on Sunday morning is:

2x/3 + 18 = 2x/3 + 6

Since the plastic flamingos were redder than the white plastic flamingos by noon on Sunday, we know that the number of pink flamingos is greater than or equal to the number of white flamingos. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2x/3 + 6 >= 2x/3 + 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x/3 + 6 >= 2x/3 + 2

x/3 + 4 >= x/3 + 2

x/3 + 2 >= 2

x/3 >= 2

x >= 6

Therefore, the neighbors placed 6 + 18 = 24 flamingos outside Sue's yard in total."	24

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. A month later, she collected three times that amount. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?

Answer: 
Elaine now has 72 Pokemon cards.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information we have:

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that amount, so she collected 20 x 3 = 60 more cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 fewer cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she had collected in the first and second months, so she collected 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 more cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 72 Pokemon cards."	72

Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, gets paid $5 for each time she hides them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can buy a jacket and shoes?	10	"Answer only. 
Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the shoes each $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, gets paid $5 for each time she hides them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can buy a jacket and shoes?

Answer:

Sarah has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting.

She gets paid $5 for each time she hides the neighbor's kids, so she earns:

4 times x $5 = $20

She also gets paid $4 for each time she mows the lawn, so she earns:

x (where x is the number of times she mows the lawn) x $4 = $4x

To buy the jacket and shoes, Sarah needs a total of:

$30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) = $50

So, Sarah needs to mow the lawn x times to earn $4x = $50 - $20 = $30.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30

Therefore, Sarah needs to mow the lawn 30 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."	30

While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?

Answer: 350

Explanation:

Let's break this down step by step:

Day 1: Sloane counts 100 customers.

Day 2: Sloane counts 50 more customers than the previous day, so he counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Day 3: Sloane counts 500 customers. To find out how many more customers he counted on the third day compared to the second day, we can subtract the number of customers he counted on the second day from the number of customers he counted on the third day:

500 - 150 = 350

Therefore, Sloane counted 350 more customers on the third day than he did on the second day."	350

Jerry has two ponds, both leaking at 4 liters per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pond had twice as much water as the small pond. Now the big pond has four times as much water as the small pond. How much water does the small pond have now?

I can't help with the wording of the question, but I can certainly help with the answer!

Let's say the small pond had x liters of water 4 minutes ago.

Since the big pond had twice as much water as the small pond, the big pond had 2x liters of water 4 minutes ago.

We know that both ponds are leaking at 4 liters per minute, so the big pond has lost 4 liters in the last 4 minutes, and the small pond has lost 4 liters as well.

So, the small pond has x - 4 liters of water now.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x - 4 = 4(2x) - 4

Simplifying the equation:

x - 4 = 8x - 16

Solving for x:

x = 12

So, the small pond has 12 liters of water now."	12

Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and the same $32.00 belt. Her salary is $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work before she can buy?

Answer: 40 hours.

Explanation:

To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and belt, we need to divide the cost of the items by her hourly wage.

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 (hourly wage) = 40 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 40 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt."	40

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Calculate an average of three years over three years if Harriet is now 21 years old.

Solution:

Harriet is half as old as Zack, so Zack is twice as old as Harriet.

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian is three times two, or six years older than Harriet.

Harriet is now 21 years old, so Adrian is 21 + 6 = 27 years old.

The average of three years over three years is:

(21 + 27 + 21) / 3 = 21 + 27 + 21 = 69 / 3 = 23

So, the average of three years over three years is 23 years old."	23

228	Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda usually adds 4 pieces per minute. Her mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. How many hours will it take them to finish the puzzle?	1	"Answer only. 
Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda usually adds 4 pieces per minute. Her mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. How many hours will it take them to finish the puzzle?

Let x be the number of pieces Kalinda can add per minute.
Let y be the number of pieces her mother can add per minute.

Since Kalinda's mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, we know that:

y = x/2

We also know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so:

x = 4

Now we can find out how many hours it will take them to finish the puzzle:

Total number of pieces = 360

Kalinda can add x = 4 pieces per minute, so she can add:

4 x 60 = 240 pieces in 1 hour

Her mother can add y = x/2 = 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute, so she can add:

2 x 60 = 120 pieces in 1 hour

Total number of pieces they can add in 1 hour = 240 + 120 = 360

Since they have to add 360 pieces in total, it will take them:

360 / 360 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother 1 hour to finish the 360-piece puzzle."	360

When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the gourds were ready, so she harvested them. How many gourds were not ready for harvesting after two weeks?

Answer: 30 gourds.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The gourd farm produced 120 gourd chicks.
2. Ashlyn went to the farm two months later, and 30 percent of the gourds were ready for harvesting.
3. So she took 30 percent of 120 gourds, which is 36 gourds, home.
4. When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the gourds were ready for harvesting.
5. Three quarters of 120 gourds is 90 gourds.
6. So, 90 - 36 = 54 gourds were not ready for harvesting after two weeks.

Therefore, the answer is 54 gourds."	54

233	There are 36 pigeons at sunset on the ice. One third jumped in and swam into the sea. One third went into the cave to eat dinner. How many were left at sunset?	12	"Answer only. 
There are 36 pigeons at sunset on the ice. One third jumped in and swam into the sea. One third went into the cave to eat dinner. How many were left at sunset?

I can do this in my head, but I'd love to see how others solve it.

There are 36 pigeons at sunset.

One third jumped in and swam into the sea.

So, 1/3 of 36 is 12.

12 pigeons jumped in and swam into the sea.

Now, there are 36 - 12 = 24 pigeons left.

One third went into the cave to eat dinner.

So, 1/3 of 24 is 8.

8 pigeons went into the cave to eat dinner.

Now, there are 24 - 8 = 16 pigeons left at sunset."	16

239	The number of pupils in the school ward was 1000. The ward had 3 entrances A, B and C for entrance and exit. If more than 30% of the pupils left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B, then the rest left through door C, count the number of pupils who left through door C.	280	"Answer only. 
The number of pupils in the school ward was 1000. The ward had 3 entrances A, B and C for entrance and exit. If more than 30% of the pupils left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B, then the rest left through door C, count the number of pupils who left through door C.

Let X be the number of pupils who left through door C.

We know that 1000 - X is the number of pupils who left through doors A and B.

We know that more than 30% of the pupils left through door A, so more than 300 (30% of 1000) left through door A.

We also know that 3/5 of the remaining pupils left through door B, so 3/5 of (1000 - 300) = 3/5 of 700 = 240 left through door B.

So, X = 1000 - 300 - 240 = 460.

Therefore, 460 pupils left through door C."	460

242	Mike was friends with 5 people. He broke up with 2 of them. They sent each other letters 2 times a week that were 5 pages long. This was his response. He could write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours did he spend writing in a week?	3	"Answer only. 
Mike was friends with 5 people. He broke up with 2 of them. They sent each other letters 2 times a week that were 5 pages long. This was his response. He could write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours did he spend writing in a week?

Answer: 24 hours.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given:

1. Mike had 5 friends.
2. He broke up with 2 of them.
3. They sent each other letters 2 times a week.
4. Each letter was 5 pages long.
5. Mike could write a page every 6 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Mike spent writing in a week:

1. Number of letters per week = 2 (since he broke up with 2 friends) x 2 (since they sent letters to each other twice a week) = 4 letters per week.
2. Total number of pages per week = 4 letters x 5 pages per letter = 20 pages per week.
3. Time taken to write one page = 6 minutes.
4. Total time taken to write 20 pages = 20 x 6 = 120 minutes.
5. Time spent writing in a week = 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, Mike spent 2 hours writing in a week."	2
243	Jason has a cell phone schedule of 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes a day to call his boss, and he has had 300 minutes a month to call other people. How many minutes did Jason have left if there are 30 days in the month?	250	"Answer only. 
Jason has a cell phone schedule of 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes a day to call his boss, and he has had 300 minutes a month to call other people. How many minutes did Jason have left if there are 30 days in the month?

Answer: Jason has 700 minutes left.

To calculate this, you need to subtract the minutes he uses for his daily call to his boss (15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes) and the minutes he uses for other calls (300 minutes) from the total minutes he has (1000 minutes).

1000 - 450 - 300 = 700"	700

Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took several more than Kyle did. Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries, and Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?

Answer: 10 fries.

Explanation:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took several more than Kyle did, so Griffin had 19 - (5 + x) = 19 - x fries left, where x is the number of fries Billy took.
4. Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries, so Griffin had 19 - x + 19 = 38 fries.
5. Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did, so Colby gave Griffin 3(5) = 15 fries.
6. Therefore, Griffin had 38 + 15 = 27 fries at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries (19 - x + 19 = 38)."	38
245	There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. There is a difference in the number of snails in these two aquariums and in the number of fish present in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. There is a difference in the number of snails in these two aquariums and in the number of fish present in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?

Let's say there are x fish in the first aquarium and y fish in the second aquarium.

We know that the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.

We also know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums.

Can you use this information to find out how many fish are in each aquarium?"	32

The movie takes five weeks to finish. After the movie is over the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?

Answer:

The makeup artist's rate is $250 per hour, so the total amount she charged Jean for the four weeks of work is:

4 weeks x 6 hours per week x $250 per hour = $48,000

However, the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, so the amount Jean paid is:

$48,000 x 0.9 = $43,200

So Jean paid $43,200 for the makeup services."	43200

249	On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue and her sister eat?	5,600	"Answer only. 
On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue and her sister eat?

Sue ate four times as many cakes as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 times 5 = 20 cakes.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cakes as her sister, so Sue ate 2 times 13 = 26 cakes.

Therefore, Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cakes.

Each cake has 200 calories, so Sue ate a total of 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day, so she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cakes.

Each cake has 200 calories, so her sister ate a total of 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

Therefore, Sue and her sister ate a total of 9200 + 3600 = 12800 calories."	12800
