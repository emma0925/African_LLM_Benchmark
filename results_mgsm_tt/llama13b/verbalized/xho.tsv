Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day. She sells the leftovers at the farmer's market every day for $2 per duck egg. How much does she make in dollars a day at the farmer's market?

I have an answer, but I'm not sure if it's correct. I'd love your help.

So, let's see...

Janet has 16 duck eggs per day.

She sells 3 per day for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 duck eggs left.

She sells these 13 duck eggs at the farmer's market for $2 per egg, so she makes:

13 x $2 = $26

per day at the farmer's market.

Is this correct? Please let me know if I've made any mistakes. Thank you!"	26

9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. And she earns 1.2 times her normal hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. And she earns 1.2 times her normal hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?

Answer: $450.

Explanation:

1. Calculate the hours worked at the normal rate:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the overtime hours:

5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60

3. Add the normal and overtime hours:

$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's salary for the week is $460."	460
10	The new system had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many things were downloaded from the system in three months?	366	"Answer only. 
The new system had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many things were downloaded from the system in three months?

Answer:

Let X be the number of downloads in the first month.

According to the problem, in the second month, the number of downloads was three times X, so the number of downloads in the second month is 3X.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, so the number of downloads in the third month is 0.3(3X) = 0.9X.

Since the system was downloaded for three months, the total number of downloads is the sum of the number of downloads in each month:

X + 3X + 0.9X = 60 + 3X + 0.9X

Simplifying, we get:

4X + 0.9X = 60

5X = 60

X = 12

So, there were 12 downloads in the first month, 36 downloads in the second month, and 9 downloads in the third month.

In total, there were 12 + 36 + 9 = 57 downloads from the system in three months."	57
11	Taula went to the bakery and bought a variety of cookies: 3 doughnuts for $68 each, 2 cupcakes for $80 each, and 6 cupcakes for $55 each.	694	"Answer only. 
Taula went to the bakery and bought a variety of cookies: 3 doughnuts for $68 each, 2 cupcakes for $80 each, and 6 cupcakes for $55 each.

How much did Taula spend in total?

I'm having trouble with the calculation. Can you help me?

Answer:

To calculate the total amount Taula spent, you need to add up the prices of all the items she bought.

3 doughnuts x $68 each = $204
2 cupcakes x $80 each = $160
6 cupcakes x $55 each = $330

Adding all these amounts together gives you the total:

$204 + $160 + $330 = $794

So, Taula spent $794 in total."	794
12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year he will grow seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. It will take how many years before he starts to make money from the lemon tree.	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year he will grow seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. It will take how many years before he starts to make money from the lemon tree.

Answer: 6 years.

Explanation:

1. Cost of planting the tree: $90
2. Annual income from selling lemons: 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50
3. Annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree: $3

So, the net income from the lemon tree in the first year is:

$10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Since the tree starts making a profit in the first year, it will take 6 years for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree, as he will have to wait for 6 years for the tree to mature and produce its first crop of lemons."	6

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remainder enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remainder enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.

What is the ratio of students who enrolled in contemporary dance to students who enrolled in jazz dance?

Please show your work.

I'm having trouble with this problem.

Thank you!

Answer:

Let C be the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance.

Since 20% of the class enrolled in contemporary dance, we can write:

C = 0.20 x 20 = 4

Now, let J be the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance.

Since 25% of the remainder enrolled in jazz dance, we can write:

J = 0.25 x (20 - 4) = 0.25 x 16 = 4

So, there are 4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.

The ratio of students who enrolled in contemporary dance to students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

4/4 = 1:1"	1

17	If she works 50 weeks a year, 50 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Answer only. 
If she works 50 weeks a year, 50 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?

Answer: $50,000.

Explanation:

1. Calculate her weekly salary as a teacher:

50 weeks/year x 50 hours/week = 2500 hours/year (as a teacher)

2. Calculate her weekly salary as a coach:

15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year (as a coach)

3. Add her weekly salary as a teacher and coach to get her total weekly salary:

2500 + 750 = 3250 hours/year (total)

4. Multiply her total weekly salary by the number of weeks she works per year to get her annual salary:

3250 hours/year x 50 weeks/year = $50,000/year (annual salary)"	50000
18	Claire makes an omelet of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Answer only. 
Claire makes an omelet of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?

I'm not sure how to approach this problem. I know that a dozen is 12, but I'm not sure how to convert the number of eggs to a dozen. Can you please help me?

Sure, I'd be happy to help! To convert the number of eggs to a dozen, we can divide the number of eggs by 12.

So, if Claire makes an omelet of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, and she does this for 4 weeks, she will eat:

3 eggs/day x 4 weeks = 12 eggs/week

Now, we can convert 12 eggs/week to a dozen by dividing by 12:

12 eggs/week ÷ 12 = 1 dozen/week

Therefore, Claire will eat 1 dozen of eggs in 4 weeks."	4

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice two-thirds of the water and I want to add them to 15 liters of pineapple juice three-fifths of the water. But when I drink it, I've wasted 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice two-thirds of the water and I want to add them to 15 liters of pineapple juice three-fifths of the water. But when I drink it, I've wasted 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?

Please help me with this question. Thank you!

So, to begin with, let's say that the amount of orange juice that you have is x liters. Since you've wasted 1 liter, the amount of orange juice that you have left is x - 1 liters.

Now, you want to add the orange juice to 15 liters of pineapple juice. Since two-thirds of the water has been added, the amount of water that has been added is 2/3 x liters.

Similarly, since three-fifths of the water has been added, the amount of water that has been added is 3/5 x liters.

So, the total amount of water that has been added is:

2/3 x + 3/5 x = 2/3 x + 3/5 (x - 1)

Now, you've wasted 1 liter of orange juice, so the total amount of water that is left is:

2/3 x + 3/5 x - 1

Simplifying the expression, we get:

2/3 x + 3/5 x - 1 = 2/3 x + 3/5 (x - 1) - 1

Solving for x, we get:

2/3 x + 3/5 x - 1 = 2/3 x + 3/5 (x - 1) - 1

x = 24

Therefore, there are 24 liters of water left."	24

Gunter tries to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says there are 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What is their average estimate?

Answer:
The first friend estimates there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
The second friend estimates there are 20 more than the first half, which is 20 + 80 = 100 jelly beans in the jar.
The third friend estimates there are 25% more than the first half, which is 1.25 x 80 = 100 jelly beans in the jar.

So, the average estimate is 80 + 100 + 100 = 280 jelly beans in the jar."	280

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Answer only. 
Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Answer: 20

Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so if she has x silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins.

Since Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."	70

38	John runs 60 miles. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half the other two days. How much does he run?	10	"Answer only. 
John runs 60 miles. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half the other two days. How much does he run?

I can see the solution, but I'm not sure how to explain it to someone who doesn't know the answer.  Can you help?

Answer: 60 miles.

Explanation:

Let's break down John's running schedule:

* He runs 3 hours on the first day.
* He runs half the remaining two days.

Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, he runs for a total of 3 hours + (2 x 0.5) = 3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours.

So, John runs for a total of 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes = 60 miles."	60
39	Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at half the speed she can run. If she jumps at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one quarter of the time walking and two thirds of the time walking?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at half the speed she can run. If she jumps at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one quarter of the time walking and two thirds of the time walking?

Answer: 24 miles.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk.
* She can jump at half the speed she can run.
* She jumps at 3 miles per hour.
* She spends one quarter of the time walking and two thirds of the time running.

We know that Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, so if she walks at x miles per hour, she can run at 4x miles per hour.

We also know that she jumps at half the speed she can run, so if she runs at 4x miles per hour, she jumps at 2x miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the total time Dana spends during her activity:

She spends one quarter of the time walking, so she spends 1/4 of 6 hours = 1 1/2 hours walking.

She spends two thirds of the time running, so she spends 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours running.

Since she jumps at 2x miles per hour, she can travel 2x miles in 1 1/2 hours = 3 miles.

Since she runs at 4x miles per hour, she can travel 4x miles in 4 hours = 12 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

3 + 12 = 15 miles

A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A freight truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the average weight of the bridge?

Hint: Think about the total weight of the truck and the boxes.

Answer: 325 boxes.

Explanation:

The total weight of the truck and the boxes must not exceed the maximum weight of the bridge, which is 5000 pounds.

Let x be the number of boxes loaded onto the truck.

The weight of the truck and the boxes is 3755 + x \* 15 = 3755 + x \* 15 pounds.

Since the total weight of the truck and the boxes must not exceed 5000 pounds, we have:

3755 + x \* 15 <= 5000

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

x \* 15 <= 1250

x <= 1250 / 15

x <= 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the average weight of the bridge is 83."	83

Janet buys her daughter a brooch. She pays $500 for the materials and then another $800 for the stone cutter to build it. Then, she pays 10% of the item to the insurance. How much did she pay?

Answer: $1,300.

Explanation:

First, calculate the cost of the materials and the stone cutter's fee:

$500 (materials) + $800 (stone cutter's fee) = $1,300

Next, calculate the 10% insurance premium:

$1,300 x 10% = $130

So, the total cost of the brooch is:

Aleena subscribed to a broadcasting service that charged her $140 a month. If the broadcasting company charged her an initial fee for the first half of the year and then charged her a lower 10% fee for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the broadcasting service at the end of the year.

Answer: $280.

Explanation:

Initial fee for the first half of the year = $140 x 6/12 = $90

Monthly fee for the second half of the year = $140 x 6/12 = $90

Total amount paid for the year = $90 + $90 = $180

Since the company charged a 10% discount for the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the year is:

$180 x 0.9 = $162

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the broadcasting service at the end of the year is $162."	162

Jim spends two hours watching TV and then ends up going to bed and reading a long half hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer:

To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends each week by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 30 minutes reading each week, so:

2 hours/week x 4 weeks = 8 hours watching TV
30 minutes/week x 4 weeks = 2 hours reading

In total, Jim spends 8 hours watching TV and 2 hours reading in 4 weeks."	4

67	A treasure hunter found a treasure chest filled with precious stones. There were 175 diamonds, 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond, and twice as many emeralds as rubles. How many precious stones were in the case?	595	"Answer only. 
A treasure hunter found a treasure chest filled with precious stones. There were 175 diamonds, 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond, and twice as many emeralds as rubles. How many precious stones were in the case?

Answer: 275 precious stones.

How did you get that answer?

There were 175 diamonds. Each diamond is worth $35, so the total value of the diamonds is:

175 x $35 = $6,125

There were 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond, so there were:

175 - 35 = 140 rubles/stones

Each ruble/stone is worth $2, so the total value of the rubles/stones is:

140 x $2 = $280

There were twice as many emeralds as rubles, so there were:

2 x 140 = 280 emeralds

Adding the total value of the diamonds, rubles/stones, and emeralds gives us the total value of the treasure:

$6,125 + $280 + $280 = $6,685

Therefore, there were 275 precious stones in the treasure chest."	275

Luke spends time at sea building sand towers. Eventually he notices that each level of the sand tower will have half the square footage as the level below it. If you make a 4-level sand tower where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of the level?

I'm having trouble figuring out how to approach this problem. I know that the top level has a square footage of 16, but I'm not sure how to determine the square footage of the other levels. Can you help me?

Answer:

The top level has a square footage of 16, so the square footage of the second level is half of that, or 8. The square footage of the third level is half of 8, or 4, and the square footage of the fourth level is half of 4, or 2.

So, the average square footage of the levels is:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

Therefore, the average square footage of the levels is 30."	30

Cecilia has recently bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, the puppy should be fed 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then the puppy should be fed 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Please help me with this problem. Thank you.

Answer: 3 bags

Explanation:

In the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day, so it needs a total of:

1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use:

180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.67 bags

Since you can't use a fraction of a bag, Cecilia will use 2 bags in the first 180 days.

For the rest of the puppy's life, it needs 2 cups of dog food per day, so it needs a total of:

2 cups/day x 365 days (1 year) = 730 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use:

730 cups / 110 cups/bag = 6.64 bags

Since you can't use a fraction of a bag, Cecilia will use 7 bags in the first year."	7
77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Let S be the amount of laundry Sarah does

Let R be the amount of laundry Raymond does

Let D be the amount of laundry David does

We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so:

S = 4D

We also know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so:

R = S/2

Now we are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so:

S = 400

Substituting this into the equation for R, we get:

R = S/2 = (400)/2 = 200

So Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now we can calculate the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David:

Difference = R - D = 200 - 4(200) = 200 - 800 = -600

So the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is -600 pounds."	600

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. What is their combined weight in pounds?

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble understanding how to approach it. Thank you!

Answer:

The problem states that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. This means that Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds.

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so:

Alex weighs 4(125) - 2 = 4(500) - 2 = 2000 - 2 = 1998 pounds

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 125 + 1998 = 2123 pounds."	2123

Gene sews a dress from old souvenir shirts. He has one shirt for each holiday in which each shirt has its own block. Each row is made of blocks from a different holiday year. He goes on four holidays a year and has been touring since he was 23 years old. He is 34 now. How many blocks of clothes does he have in total?

Answer: 16 blocks.

Explanation:

* Gene has been on 4 holidays a year for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).
* Each holiday has its own block of clothes.
* Therefore, Gene has 4 blocks of clothes for each holiday, for a total of 4 x 11 = 44 blocks.

However, this answer is not correct because the question states that each row is made of blocks from a different holiday year. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of blocks by the number of rows to find the number of blocks in each row.

* 44 blocks / 4 rows = 11 blocks per row.

So, Gene has 11 blocks of clothes in each row, for a total of 16 blocks (4 rows x 11 blocks per row)."	11

Greg has an alarm set to go off three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it goes off until Greg turns it off. The first time it goes off today, it goes off four times. The second time it goes off, it goes off three times as much. The third time, it goes off half as much as the second time. How many nutrients does the alarm go off in total?

Answer: 17.

Explanation:

The first time the alarm goes off, it goes off four times, so it goes off for a total of 4 x 3 = 12 times.

The second time the alarm goes off, it goes off three times as much as the first time, so it goes off for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 times.

The third time the alarm goes off, it goes off half as much as the second time, so it goes off for a total of 36 / 2 = 18 times.

Adding up all these times gives us a total of 12 + 36 + 18 = 17 times."	17

The company pays each employee $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the salary of each employee by 10% of the starting salary annually for those who stay with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after three years of service?

Answer: $780 per month.

Explanation:

Sylvie started working for the company 3 years ago, so she has been with the company for 3 years.

Her starting salary was $600 per month.

After one year of service, her salary was increased by 10% of her starting salary, which is $60 per month.

So, her salary after one year of service is $600 + $60 = $660 per month.

After two years of service, her salary was increased by 10% of her current salary, which is $66 per month.

So, her salary after two years of service is $660 + $66 = $726 per month.

If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, her salary after three years of service would be $726 per month."	726
88	Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?	8000	"Answer only. 
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?

Let X be the number of copies Harald sold.

We know that Marilyn's sales were 10 times as many as Harald's, so Marilyn's sales were 10X.

We also know that the combined sales of Marilyn and Harald were 88,000.

So we can set up the equation:

10X + X = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

11X = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:

X = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies."	8000
89	Christina is planning a birthday party and wants 75 gift bags for each boy, because a quarter of the groomsmen aren't gifts. She has invited 16 friends. The gift bags cost $2 each. How much will she spend?	24	"Answer only. 
Christina is planning a birthday party and wants 75 gift bags for each boy, because a quarter of the groomsmen aren't gifts. She has invited 16 friends. The gift bags cost $2 each. How much will she spend?

Answer: $140.

Explanation:

To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to first find out how many groomsmen she has. Since a quarter of the groomsmen aren't gifts, we can find out how many groomsmen she has by multiplying the number of friends she has invited by 4.

16 friends x 4 = 64 groomsmen

Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina will need to buy 64 gift bags.

64 gift bags x $2 = $128

Since Christina wants to give each boy 75 gift bags, she will spend $128 x 75 = $9,000."	9000

Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, and Marcia has twice as many as Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets does she have in total?

Answer: 8.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia.
2. Marcia has twice as many pets as Cindy.

Now, let's use this information to find out how many pets Cindy has:

Cindy has twice as many pets as Marcia, so Cindy has 2 \* 3 = 6 pets.

Therefore, Cindy has 6 pets in total."	6

If Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	"Answer only. 
Lee used to run the 400-meter race two seconds faster than Gerald, who ran the 400-meter race. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?

Let's assume that Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds, so:

Lee's time = 38 seconds

Gerald's original time = Lee's time x 0.9 (since Gerald ran 10% slower than Lee)

Gerald's original time = 38 x 0.9 = 34.2 seconds

Now, since Gerald changed his diet, his new time is:

Gerald's new time = 34.2 x 1.10 = 37.82 seconds

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 37.82 seconds."	37

97	When Freda cooks the pickled tomatoes in the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each of the 16 cans of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Fred use?	12	"Answer only. 
When Freda cooks the pickled tomatoes in the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each of the 16 cans of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Fred use?

I'm happy to help! Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Each can of tomatoes has three tomatoes.
2. Freda uses 16 cans of tomatoes.
3. The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
4. John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many tomatoes Freda used.

First, we know that each can of tomatoes has three tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by three to find out how many tomatoes Freda used:

16 cans x 3 tomatoes/can = 48 tomatoes

But wait, we also know that the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the tomatoes after cooking.

So, if the tomatoes lose half their volume, the volume of the tomatoes after cooking is:

48 tomatoes x 2 (since they lose half their volume) = 96 tomatoes

Now we can use the information that John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce to find out how many tomatoes Freda used:

96 tomatoes / 32 ounces/tomato = 3 tomatoes/ounce

Therefore, Freda used 3 x 32 = 96 tomatoes to make John's last batch of tomato sauce."	96

Henry bakes cookies for a local baking contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted. He drops his 5 cookies when he takes them out to cool, and now he has 110 cookies in total. How many cookies has Henry baked in the past year?

Solution:

Let X be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

Since he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he bakes 2X cookies this year.

He drops 5 cookies when he takes them out to cool, so he has 2X - 5 cookies in total.

We are given that he has 110 cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2X - 5 = 110

Solving for X, we get:

2X = 110 + 5
2X = 115

X = 57.5

Therefore, Henry baked 57.5 cookies last year."	57

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's two rolls are 24 rolls wide while Marcel's are 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long. If they both ate their own amount, how many did they eat on average?

Please show your work.

Thank you!

I'm happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the rolls that each person ate.

For Marcel, we know that he ate 3 rolls that are 14 rolls long, so the total area he ate is:

3 x 14 = 42 square rolls

For Beatrice, we know that she ate 24 rolls that are 2 rolls wide, so the total area she ate is:

24 x 2 = 48 square rolls

To find the average amount of rolls that each person ate, we divide the total area by the number of rolls:

For Marcel:

42 square rolls / 3 rolls = 14 square rolls per roll

For Beatrice:

48 square rolls / 24 rolls = 2 square rolls per roll

So, on average, Marcel ate 14 square rolls per roll, and Beatrice ate 2 square rolls per roll."	2

If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the couple was earning after four years?	95200	"Answer only. 
Adrien's total salary is 30% more than Lylah's. After 4 years, her salary had increased, and she was earning 40% more than she was four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the couple was earning after four years?

Answer: $64,000.

Explanation:

Let's start by finding Lylah's salary four years ago. Since her salary increased by 40%, we can say that her salary four years ago was $40,000 x 0.6 = $24,000.

Now, Adrien's salary is 30% more than Lylah's salary four years ago. So, Adrien's salary four years ago would be $24,000 x 1.3 = $31,200.

After four years, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries have increased by the same percentage. So, their current salaries are:

Adrien's salary = $31,200 x 1.3 = $40,560
Lylah's salary = $24,000 x 1.3 = $31,200

The total salary the couple is earning after four years is:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $40,560 + $31,200
= $64,000."	64000

The hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and the hospital $200 per hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from visits?

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.

Let's start by finding out how many hours the doctors spend seeing patients each day.

500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

12,000 minutes/day / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours/day

Now, we know that the doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total amount they charge for seeing patients each day is:

200 hours/day x $150/hour = $30,000/day

The hospital also charges $200 per hour for the patients, so the total amount they charge for visits each day is:

200 hours/day x $200/hour = $40,000/day

Now, let's find out how much profit the hospital makes from visits each day. To do this, we need to subtract the cost of seeing patients from the total amount charged.

$40,000/day - $30,000/day = $10,000/day

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day from visits."	10000

Nissa has hired 60 year-round employees to play the elves in her department store in Santa's village. The third elf quit after being rejected by the children, then the remaining 10 elves quit after the children ran out of numbers. How many elves are left?

Answer: 80.

Explanation:

* The third elf quit after being rejected by the children, so there were 60 - 1 = 59 elves left.
* The remaining 10 elves quit after the children ran out of numbers, so there were 59 - 10 = 49 elves left.

Therefore, there are 80 elves left (49 + 31)."	31

Answer: 7 miles.

Explanation:

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, so he walked a total of 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 miles, so he walked a total of 10 miles (6 miles + 4 miles).

On Wednesday, he walked 7 miles, so he walked a total of 17 miles (10 miles + 7 miles).

Therefore, Walt walked 7 miles on Wednesday."	7

Answer:

Total cost of order = $7.50 x 2 + $1.50 x 2 + $1.00 = $22.00

Shipping fee = 20% of $22.00 = $4.40

Total cost of shipping = $4.40

John buys the milk for $2, the eggs for $3, the lights for $3, the cups for $3, and the duck catcher for $4. If there is a 10 percent tax on nonfood items, what is the total cost?

Answer: $19.80

Explanation:

The total cost of the items before tax is:

$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

The tax on nonfood items is 10 percent of $15, which is:

$15 x 0.10 = $1.50

So, the total cost with tax is:

$15 + $1.50 = $19.80"	19

Kim has started her own business as a housekeeper and calculates the profit she will make from her clients. She already has three clients, but she is talking to 5 other potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in her calculations. Each client's household will need 2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning cloths. The detergent bottles will cost $2 each and the pack of cleaning cloths will cost $5 each. These are her costs. Calculate her total weekly salary to be $92. The profit is only the difference between the total salary and the total costs, so what is the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make per week?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Total weekly salary = Total income - Total costs
2. Total income = (3 clients x $20 per client) + (5 potential clients x $20 per client)
3. Total income = ($60 + $100) = $160
4. Total costs = (3 clients x $2 x 2 bottles) + (5 potential clients x $2 x 2 bottles) + (3 clients x $5 x 1 pack) + (5 potential clients x $5 x 1 pack)
5. Total costs = ($6 x 4 bottles + $10 x 4 bottles + $15 x 1 pack + $25 x 1 pack) = $92
6. Profit per week = Total income - Total costs = $160 - $92 = $68
7. Profit per dollar = Profit per week / Total income = $68 / $160 = 0.42 or 42%

Therefore, Kim's profit per week is $68 and her profit per dollar is 42%."	42

Johnny is picking up toys on the floor of his room. He had thrown a box of 500 pieces of Lego on the floor, along with one with three times as many pieces as the 500 pieces, and another with a quarter of the number of pieces. How many blocks did Johnny pick up if he picked up all the Lego?

Let's denote the number of pieces in the box of Lego as x.

We know that Johnny picked up all the Lego, so he picked up:

* 500 pieces from the first box
* 3x pieces from the second box
*  quarter of x pieces from the third box

Adding all these up, we get:

500 + 3x + quarter of x = total number of pieces picked up

Simplifying, we get:

500 + 3x + x/4 = total number of pieces picked up

Combine like terms:

6x + 500 = total number of pieces picked up

Solve for x:

6x = 500 + 500

6x = 1000

x = 1000/6

x = 167

So, Johnny picked up 167 boxes of Lego."	167

So all the bees that had previously left would not have returned to the cave in the next 6 hours. How many bees have you seen returning to the cave in the last 6 hours?

Please provide step-by-step solution.

Answer: 20 bees have returned to the cave in the last 6 hours.

Step-by-step solution:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leaving the cave.
2. In the next 6 hours, she saw twice as many bees as the ones she first saw flying out of the cave, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.
3. However, she also saw that all the bees that had previously left would not have returned to the cave in the next 6 hours. This means that the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours would not have returned in the next 6 hours.
4. Therefore, the total number of bees returning to the cave in the last 6 hours is 60 - 30 = 30 bees.
5. So, Debra has seen 20 bees returning to the cave in the last 6 hours (30 - 30/2 = 20)."	20

On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, college student Kimo has three classes a day. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two-hour classes a day. In one semester there are 16 school weeks. In the other semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Kimo has three classes per day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (3 days x 3 classes per day = 9 classes per week).
2. Kimo has two-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays (2 days x 2 hours per day = 4 hours per week).
3. There are 16 weeks in one semester.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:

9 classes per week x 16 weeks = 144 hours

Adding the 4 hours per week from Tuesdays and Thursdays, we get:

144 hours + 4 hours = 148 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 148 hours attending classes in one semester."	148

How much faster does the winner run than the loser?

I can't answer this question because the information provided is not sufficient to determine the winner or the time taken by each runner. The information provided is:

* Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 10-yard long football field.
* Kelly runs back and forth once, then starts running on the 40-yard line and back. She does it 43 times.

There is no information provided on the time taken by each runner or the distance covered by each runner. Therefore, it is not possible to determine who the winner is or how much faster the winner runs than the loser."	43

Jackie is faced with the decision of whether to do the tax herself or hire an accountant. If she does the tax herself, she will be able to do 3 hours of self-employment, losing $35 in lost wages. The accountant costs $90. How much money will you have if you hire an accountant?

I'm not able to answer this question as it is based on a false assumption that $35 in lost wages is a real cost. As a self-employed individual, Jackie's time is not considered lost wages, it is considered a business expense. Therefore, the correct answer is that there is no cost to Jackie for doing her own taxes."	35

For her birthday, Elvia chooses a new multi-functional computer as a gift. She has a 1500 euro wallet donated by her entire family and thinks she can save a little money to pay for something special. She goes to a computer store and chooses a 1090 euro machine with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also buys a scanner for 157 euros, a tablet machine for 74 euros and a 102 hour printer. How much will the rest of the money cost?

Please let me know how much the rest of the money will cost.

Answer:

To calculate the cost of the rest of the money, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Elvia purchased from the amount of money she has available.

Total cost of items purchased = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros

Available money = 1500 euros

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the available money, we get:

1500 - 1423 = 77 euros

So, the rest of the money will cost 77 euros."	77

170	A group of marching band members order a new uniform. Each uniform is accompanied by a $25 hat, a shirt that costs three times as much as the hat, and a pair of trousers that cost as much as the hat and the shirt.	150	"Answer only. 
A group of marching band members order a new uniform. Each uniform is accompanied by a $25 hat, a shirt that costs three times as much as the hat, and a pair of trousers that cost as much as the hat and the shirt.

If the total cost of the uniform is $150, how much does each uniform cost?

Answer: $50.

Explanation:

Let x be the cost of the hat.

Since the shirt costs three times as much as the hat, the cost of the shirt is 3x.

The trousers cost as much as the hat and the shirt, so the cost of the trousers is x + 3x = 4x.

The total cost of the uniform is 4x + 3x + x = 8x.

Since the total cost is $150, we know that 8x = 150.

Solving for x, we get x = 150/8 = 18.75.

Therefore, each uniform costs $18.75."	18
171	Jake at the Museum of Natural History. You see 80 eight-legged spiders, 90 six-legged insects, and a rare ten-legged reptile. How many legs do you see in total, Jake?	1210	"Answer only. 
Jake at the Museum of Natural History. You see 80 eight-legged spiders, 90 six-legged insects, and a rare ten-legged reptile. How many legs do you see in total, Jake?

Hint: Think about each group of animals and how many legs they have. Then, add up the total number of legs you see.

Answer:

To find the total number of legs, we need to add up the number of legs for each group of animals.

80 eight-legged spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 legs
90 six-legged insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 legs
1 rare ten-legged reptile x 10 legs per reptile = 100 legs

Adding up all these legs gives us a total of:

640 + 540 + 100 = 1,280 legs

So, Jake sees a total of 1,280 legs at the Museum of Natural History."	1280

Juan and his brother sell lemonade. Each gallon they make costs $3 for the lemon and $2 for the lemon. They sell the glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for each gallon. If they make a profit of $25, how much do they spend on lemonade?

Answer:

To find out how much they spend on lemonade, we need to find out how much they spend on lemons and how much they spend on cups.

Let's start by finding out how much they spend on lemons. They use 3 gallons of lemonade, so they use 3 x $3 = $9 worth of lemons.

Now, let's find out how much they spend on cups. They use 20 glasses for each gallon, so they use 3 x 20 = $60 worth of cups.

Adding the cost of lemons and cups, we get:

$9 + $60 = $69

So, they spend $69 on lemonade."	69

Two track teams compete in a 400-meter relay; a race in which each team has four members who run the 400 meters, or one lap, on a standard track. One of the teams is circled by 100 and the members will run the 400 meters on foot in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is not circled well; their runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds so each runner will be 3 seconds faster than the runner before them. Using this information, how many seconds will the team run?

Answer: 
The first team will run the 400 meters in 55 seconds, so each runner will be 55/4 = 13.75 seconds per lap.
The second team will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds, so each runner will be 60/4 = 15 seconds per lap.
Since the second team is 1.25 seconds slower per lap than the first team, the total time difference between the two teams will be:
1.25 x 4 laps = 5 seconds
Therefore, the second team will finish 5 seconds behind the first team."	5
184	Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, what is it like (expressed as a percentage) if you rotate a number greater than this	25	"Answer only. 
Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, what is it like (expressed as a percentage) if you rotate a number greater than this

Answer:

If Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, it means that every digit in the number is shifted 6 places to the left.

For example, if Jerry rotates the number 123456, it becomes 654321.

If the number is greater than 123456, the rotation will result in a larger percentage change.

For example, if Jerry rotates the number 1000000, it becomes 900909.

In this case, the number has increased by 10% (900909 / 1000000) due to the rotation.

Therefore, if Jerry rotates a number greater than 123456, the percentage change will be greater than 100%."	100

188	A trader buys bags of quality wheat for $20 a bag. If it costs $2 to transport it from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at an average cost of 30 percent each, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A trader buys bags of quality wheat for $20 a bag. If it costs $2 to transport it from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at an average cost of 30 percent each, how many bags did he sell?

Answer: 
The trader sold 13 bags of wheat.

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Cost of one bag of wheat = $20
2. Transportation cost per bag = $2
3. Profit made by the trader = $400
4. Average profit percentage = 30%

Now, let's work out the calculation:

1. Total cost of all bags = $20 x 13 = $260
2. Total profit = $400
3. Profit percentage = (Total profit / Total cost) x 100
= ($400 / $260) x 100
= 153.85%

Since the profit percentage is more than 100%, it means that the trader made a profit of more than the total cost of the bags. Therefore, the number of bags sold must be less than 13.

13 - 1 = 12

So, the trader sold 12 bags of wheat."	12

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die. How many trees does he leave?

Answer: 35 trees.

Explanation:

10 years ago, Tom had 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, so he has:

50 + 10 - 2 = 58 trees

After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die, so:

58 x 0.3 = 17.4 trees die

58 - 17.4 = 40.6 trees left

Rounding down to the nearest whole number, Tom has 40 trees left."	40

Josie grows grapes on 10 acre farms. One Acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and produces 2 barrels of pressed grapes. How many barrels of pressed grapes does he produce per year on his farm?

Answer:

To find out how many barrels of pressed grapes Josie produces per year on his farm, we need to multiply the number of acres he has by the number of barrels produced per acre.

Since one acre produces 2 barrels of pressed grapes, if Josie has 10 acres of farmland, he will produce:

10 acres x 2 barrels/acre = 20 barrels of pressed grapes per year

Therefore, Josie produces 20 barrels of pressed grapes per year on his farm."	20

If Brinley has a score of 89 71,92,100 and a score of 86 in his first 5 tests, how many scores does he need in the 6th test to get an average of 93?

Answer: 98.

Explanation:

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs to have a total score of 93 x 6 = 558.

He already has a score of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, so he needs 558 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 558 - 458 = 100.

Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 100 on the 6th test to get an average of 93."	93

Answer:

To find the total distance Michael cycled, we need to calculate the distance he cycled in each week and then add them up.

Week 1: 5 weeks x 25 km/week = 125 km

Week 2: 2 weeks x 60 km/week = 120 km

Week 3: 1 week x 60 km/week = 60 km

Total distance = 125 km + 120 km + 60 km = 305 km"	305

209	A can of 20 cups costs $1,200 less than the total cost of a half-can of plates that sells for $6,000 each.	145	"Answer only. 
A can of 20 cups costs $1,200 less than the total cost of a half-can of plates that sells for $6,000 each.
How many cups of can A cost?

Answer: $6,000 / $1,200 = 5 cups

Explanation:
Let's say the cost of a full can of plates is x.
Then, the cost of a half-can of plates is x/2.

According to the problem, the cost of a half-can of plates is $6,000, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 6,000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12,000

Now, we know that the cost of a full can of plates is $12,000.

According to the problem, a can of 20 cups costs $1,200 less than the total cost of a half-can of plates. So, we can set up the equation:

12,000 - 1,200 = 20 x

Solving for x, we get:

20 x = 10,800

x = 5

Therefore, a can of 20 cups costs $5 x $1,200 = $6,000."	6000

Sara wants to buy herself a new coat and 2 pairs of shoes. The coat she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara takes care of 4 children of 4 neighbors, earning $5 for every time she takes care of them. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she mows the lawn. If Sara already has $10 saved before she mows the lawn for the children, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can buy the coat and shoes?

Answer:
Sara needs to mow the lawn 3 times to earn enough money to buy the coat and shoes.

Explanation:

* Sara has $10 saved already.
* She earns $5 for every time she takes care of the children, so she needs to take care of the children 3 times to earn $15 more ($5 x 3 = $15).
* She also earns $4 for mowing the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn 1 time to earn $4 more ($4 x 1 = $4).
* Total amount needed to buy the coat and shoes = $30 + $20 + $15 + $4 = $79.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 3 times to earn enough money to buy the coat and shoes."	3
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?	4	"Answer only. 
Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?

Answer: 2

Explanation:

Let's say Jerry has x red chickens.

Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3x.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by all chickens is:

3x + 5(x-2) = 42

where x is the number of red chickens.

Solving for x, we get:

3x + 5(x-2) = 42

3x + 5x - 10 = 42

8x - 10 = 42

8x = 52

x = 7

So Jerry has 7 red chickens."	7

216	Janet borrowed $2,000 and offered to pay it back with an interest rate of 10 percent. If she was to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?	220	"Answer only. 
Janet borrowed $2,000 and offered to pay it back with an interest rate of 10 percent. If she was to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?

Answer: $1,435

Explanation:

To find out how much money Janet would have left over, we need to calculate the total amount of money that she would have paid over the 12 months.

Total amount paid = (12 x $165) + $2,000

Total amount paid = $2,000 + (12 x $165)

Total amount paid = $2,000 + $1,980

Total amount paid = $3,980

So, Janet would have $3,980 - $2,000 = $1,980 left over.

Therefore, the answer is $1,980."	1980

James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage () of the newly selected card that will be the type of water?

Answer: 20%

Explanation:

Let's say James has x types of water cards after losing 8.

He has 30 + 20 + x = 50 cards in total.

If he buys 14 types of grass cards, he will have:

30 + 20 + x + 14 = 50 + 14 = 64 cards in total.

The percentage of water cards in the newly selected cards is:

(x / 64) x 100 = (x / 64) x 100%

Since James loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, the percentage of water cards in the newly selected cards is:

(8 / 64) x 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, the percentage of the newly selected card that will be the type of water is 12.5%."	12

237	Johnny took his 10 dollars license and added more and more to it. Then he locked it away, which tripled in one year. How much money did he have a year later?	90	"Answer only. 
Johnny took his 10 dollars license and added more and more to it. Then he locked it away, which tripled in one year. How much money did he have a year later?

Answer: $30.

Explanation: If Johnny had $10 and added more money to it, then he had a total of $10 + whatever additional amount he added. Let's assume he added an additional $x dollars.

So, the total amount of money Johnny had after adding the additional amount is:

$10 + x

If he then locked this amount away and it tripled in one year, then the amount of money he had after one year is:

$10 + x x 3 = $10 + 3x

Since Johnny had $10 to start with, we can simplify the equation as:

$10 + 3x = $30

Solving for x, we get:

x = $20

So, Johnny had $20 added to his initial $10, for a total of $30 after one year."	30

If after the meeting an average of 30 percent of the students left the building using exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left using exit B, and the remaining students all left using exit C, count the number of students who left using exit C.

Solve the problem step by step.

Answer: 250

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who left using exit A.

30% of 1000 = 300

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who left using exit B.

3/5 of 700 (remaining students after exit A) = 210

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who left using exit C.

1000 - 300 - 210 = 250

Therefore, 250 students left using exit C."	250

James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James.

Please provide step by step solution.

Thank you.

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. James has 6 more candies than Robert.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert.
3. John has 54 candies.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many more candies John has than James.

First, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can start by finding out how many candies Robert has:

Robert has 54 - 6 = 48 candies.

Next, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can find out how many candies John has by multiplying the number of candies Robert has by 2:

John has 2 x 48 = 96 candies.

Now, we want to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we can subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

John has 96 candies, James has 48 candies, so:

96 - 48 = 48

Therefore, John has 48 more candies than James."	48

245	There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums. If the aquariums have the same number of alligators in them, how many alligators are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums. If the aquariums have the same number of alligators in them, how many alligators are in each aquarium?

Answer:

The aquariums have the same number of alligators, so let's say there are x alligators in each aquarium.

The difference between the number of alligators in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So we can set up the equation:

x - 4 = 2(x + 32)

Simplifying the equation:

x - 4 = 2x + 64

Solving for x:

x = 40

So there are 40 alligators in each aquarium."	40

Jean's repairman costs $250 an hour. He needs the most expensive mics for the movie he's in and it takes six hours to make a day and he needs to make a week. The movie takes five weeks to finish. After the movie is finished the repairman gives Jean a 10 percent discount for the average amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?

I can do this one!

First, we need to calculate the total amount Jean will pay for the repairman's services:

Total = 6 hours/day x 5 days/week x 5 weeks = 1500 hours

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the services at the regular rate:

Regular cost = 250/hour x 1500 hours = $375,000

Finally, we need to calculate the discounted amount that Jean will pay:

Discounted amount = $375,000 x 10% = $37,500

So, Jean will pay $37,500 for the repairman's services."	37500

Isabelle bought supplies for her younger sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake mixes, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on bags of treats for guests. She divided the cost equally between her parents. How many dollars did each person say they paid?

Answer: $41

Explanation:
To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people splitting the cost. In this case, the total cost is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $108.

If there are 4 people splitting the cost (Isabelle and her 3 parents), then each person would pay:

$108 ÷ 4 = $27

So each person paid $27."	27
