Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three eggs a day for breakfast and cooks four more to put in a muffin for her friends. She sells the remaining eggs at the farmer's market for $2 a day. How much does she make a day at the farmer's market?

Answer: $6 per day.

Explanation:

* Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day.
* Janet eats 3 eggs a day for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
* She cooks 4 eggs to put in a muffin for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
* She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmer's market for $2 each, so she makes $2 x 9 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmer's market."	18

Josh decided to try to buy a substandard house and invest money, then sell it. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the houses he bought by 150%. How much profit did he make?

Answer: $130,000

Explanation:

First, calculate the increased value of the house after renovation:

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

Then, calculate the profit:

$120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000

7	Carla downloads 200 GB of data. Normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute, but when she reaches 40% of the downloaded data, her computer shuts down, so that the next update takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to download the data again from the beginning. How long will it take to download the data?	160	"Answer only. 
Carla downloads 200 GB of data. Normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute, but when she reaches 40% of the downloaded data, her computer shuts down, so that the next update takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to download the data again from the beginning. How long will it take to download the data?

Answer: 40 minutes.

Explanation:

If Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, then it will take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the entire data.

However, when she reaches 40% of the downloaded data (i.e., 80 GB), her computer shuts down, so she has to start again from the beginning.

Therefore, the total time taken to download the data will be:

100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes (or 2 hours)

So, it will take 2 hours to download the entire 200 GB of data."	200

13	Melanie is a salesperson. She sold a third of her kit of vacuum cleaners to the green house, sold 2 more to the red house, and sold half to the papal house from what she had left. If Melanie had 5 mobile phones left, how many did she have when she started selling?	18	"Answer only. 
Melanie is a salesperson. She sold a third of her kit of vacuum cleaners to the green house, sold 2 more to the red house, and sold half to the papal house from what she had left. If Melanie had 5 mobile phones left, how many did she have when she started selling?

Answer:

Let X be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the start.

Since she sold a third of her kit to the green house, she has X/3 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold 2 more to the red house, so she has X/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what she had left to the papal house, so she has X/3 - 2/2 = X/6 vacuum cleaners left.

Since Melanie has 5 mobile phones left, we can set up the equation:

X/3 - 2/2 = 5

Solving for X, we get:

X = 18

So Melanie had 18 vacuum cleaners when she started selling."	18
14	In the dance class, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% enrolled in Jazz dance, and the remainder enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of students enrolled in Hip-hop dance?	60	"Answer only. 
In the dance class, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% enrolled in Jazz dance, and the remainder enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of students enrolled in Hip-hop dance?

Answer: 40%

Explanation:

Let X be the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

We know that 20% of the students enrolled in modern dance, so the number of students who enrolled in modern dance is 20% of the total number of students, which is:

20% of 100 = 20

So, there are 20 students who enrolled in modern dance.

We also know that 25% of the students enrolled in Jazz dance, so the number of students who enrolled in Jazz dance is 25% of the total number of students, which is:

25% of 100 = 25

So, there are 25 students who enrolled in Jazz dance.

Now, we can find out the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in modern dance and Jazz dance from the total number of students:

100 - 20 - 25 = 55

So, there are 55 students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

55/100 = 40%"	40
15	A businessman is faced with a choice between two purchases: $5,000 worth of cosmetics or $8,000 worth of electricity.

If the businessman has to choose the one with the highest profit by the end of the month, how much profit will it make?	125	"Answer only. 
A businessman is faced with a choice between two purchases: $5,000 worth of cosmetics or $8,000 worth of electricity. His financial advisor estimates that the market for cosmetics will go up 2.5% and electricity will go up 1.2% in the same month. If the businessman has to choose the one with the highest profit by the end of the month, how much profit will it make?

Answer:

The profit from the cosmetics purchase would be:

$5,000 x 2.5% = $125

The profit from the electricity purchase would be:

$8,000 x 1.2% = $96

Therefore, the cosmetics purchase would result in a higher profit of $125, compared to the electricity purchase which would result in a profit of $96."	96

19	Marissa walks 12 miles. She walks the first two miles in an hour, then the next two miles in an hour. If she wants to run at 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) does she need to go?	6	"Answer only. 
Marissa walks 12 miles. She walks the first two miles in an hour, then the next two miles in an hour. If she wants to run at 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) does she need to go?

I know the answer is 4 miles per hour, but I don't understand why. Please explain.

Answer: 4 miles per hour.

Explanation:

Marissa walks the first two miles in an hour, so her speed is 2 miles per hour.

Then, she walks the next two miles in another hour, so her speed is still 2 miles per hour.

If she wants to run at 4 miles per hour, she needs to increase her speed by 2 miles per hour (4 - 2 = 2).

Therefore, Marissa needs to run at a speed of 4 miles per hour."	4

Gloria is a shoe buyer who usually finds a new pair of shoes in her closet. Instead she has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of leather shoes for which she spends five dollars to buy two pairs of shoes. If a pair of leather shoes costs $33 and the second one is twice as much, how much are the boots worth?

Answer:
The first pair of leather shoes costs $33, so the second pair costs $33 x 2 = $66.
Gloria spends $5 on two pairs of shoes, so she pays $5 + $66 = $71 for the two pairs of shoes.
Therefore, the boots are worth $71 - $66 = $5."	5
30	The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of . . . to 7:11. Add up their ages to 162 and figure out how many years Allen will live in 10 years from now.	109	"Answer only. 
The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of . . . to 7:11. Add up their ages to 162 and figure out how many years Allen will live in 10 years from now.

Answer:

Allen will live 10 years from now for 17 years.

Explanation:

Let's say Darrell's age is x.

Then, Allen's age is 7x + 11.

We know that the sum of their ages is 162:

x + (7x + 11) = 162

Combine like terms:

8x + 11 = 162

Subtract 11 from both sides:

8x = 151

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 18

So, Darrell is 18 years old and Allen is 7x + 11 = 7(18) + 11 = 129 + 11 = 140 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 140 + 10 = 150 years old."	150
31	Gunter tries to count the number of jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends to tell him how many jelly beans they think he has in the jar. One says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, another says there are 20 more than the average, and a third says there are 25% more than the average. What is the average of their estimates?	80	"Answer only. 
Gunter tries to count the number of jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends to tell him how many jelly beans they think he has in the jar. One says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, another says there are 20 more than the average, and a third says there are 25% more than the average. What is the average of their estimates?

Let's start by converting the estimates to numbers:

1. 80 jelly beans in the jar
2. 20 more than the average (let's assume the average is x) = 20 + x
3. 25% more than the average (let's assume the average is x) = 1.25x

Now, we can list the estimates in a table:

| Estimate | Number of Jelly Beans |
| --- | --- |
| 80 | 80 |
| 20 + x | 20 + x |
| 1.25x | 1.25x |

Next, we can add up all the estimates to find the total:

Total = 80 + (20 + x) + (1.25x)

Simplifying the expression:

Total = 80 + 20 + x + 1.25x

Total = 120 + 1.25x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 120 from both sides:

1.25x = 20

x = 16

So, the average of the estimates is 16 jelly beans in the jar."	16

43	If a 300-pound sack of food contains 5 servings, how many calories would you consume if the 2,000-pound sack of food per day contained 1,800 calories?	48	"Answer only. 
If a 300-pound sack of food contains 5 servings, how many calories would you consume if the 2,000-pound sack of food per day contained 1,800 calories?

Answer: 1,800 calories.

Explanation:

To determine the number of calories in a 300-pound sack of food, we need to know the serving size and the number of servings per day. The problem states that the 300-pound sack of food contains 5 servings, so we can calculate the number of calories in each serving as follows:

Calories per serving = Total calories in the sack / Number of servings
Calories per serving = 1,800 calories / 5 servings
Calories per serving = 360 calories per serving

Since the problem states that the 2,000-pound sack of food contains 1,800 calories, we can calculate the number of servings per day as follows:

Number of servings per day = Total calories in the sack / Calories per serving
Number of servings per day = 1,800 calories / 360 calories per serving
Number of servings per day = 5 servings per day

Therefore, if a 300-pound sack of food contains 5 servings, and the 2,000-pound sack of food per day contains 1,800 calories, then the number of calories consumed per day would be 5 servings x 360 calories per serving = 1,800 calories."	1800
44	Charlie wants to sell candles made from honeycombs. For every pound of honeycombs he can make 10 candles. One pound and a string of candles cost $10.00 at retail. If each candle sells for $2.00, how much profit does he make selling 20 candles?	20	"Answer only. 
Charlie wants to sell candles made from honeycombs. For every pound of honeycombs he can make 10 candles. One pound and a string of candles cost $10.00 at retail. If each candle sells for $2.00, how much profit does he make selling 20 candles?

Answer:
$4.00

Explanation:

To find out how much profit Charlie makes selling 20 candles, we need to subtract the cost of making one candle from the price of one candle.

Cost of making one candle = $2.00 (price of one candle) / 10 (number of candles per pound of honeycombs)
= $2.00 / 10
= $0.20

So, the cost of making one candle is $0.20.

Profit per candle = Price of one candle - Cost of making one candle
= $2.00 - $0.20
= $1.80

Profit for 20 candles = 20 x Profit per candle
= 20 x $1.80
= $36.00

Therefore, Charlie makes a profit of $36.00 selling 20 candles."	20

Last week, she wrote 5 speeches on Tuesday, and on Tuesday she wrote two-fifths as many as she did on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many speeches as she wrote on Tuesday. Check out the total number of hours she spent writing speeches on all three days.

Answer: 22 hours

Explanation:

Tuesday:

* She wrote 5 speeches, and each speech takes 4 hours to research and write.
* So, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing speeches on Tuesday.

Wednesday:

* She wrote twice as many speeches as she wrote on Tuesday.
* So, she wrote 2 x 20 = 40 hours of speeches on Wednesday.

Total:

* 20 hours (Tuesday) + 40 hours (Wednesday) = 60 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 60 hours writing speeches on all three days."	60

John's red ties cost twice as much as his blue ones. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones. He spent $200 on the blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the ties?

Answer: $200

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how much John spent on blue ties. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:

$200 / $40 = 5 ties

Now, we know that John's red ties cost twice as much as his blue ties. So, the cost of one red tie is:

$40 x 2 = $80

Since John spent $200 on blue ties, he must have spent $200 x 2 = $400 on red ties.

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

$400 + $200 = $600"	600

Richard lives in a small rental apartment with 15 bedrooms, each of which has 8 bedrooms, and three quarters of the building is occupied by tenants.

How many people live in the building?

Answer: 120 people live in the building.

Explanation:

* 15 bedrooms x 8 bedrooms per bedroom = 120 bedrooms
* Since three quarters of the building is occupied, 3/4 x 120 bedrooms = 90 tenants
* Each tenant occupies one bedroom, so 90 tenants x 1 tenant per bedroom = 90 tenants

Therefore, there are 90 tenants living in the building."	90
50	Lloyd owns an egg farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day, which he sells for $2 an ounce. How much does Lloyd make a week from eggs?	294	"Answer only. 
Lloyd owns an egg farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day, which he sells for $2 an ounce. How much does Lloyd make a week from eggs?

Answer:

Lloyd makes $504 a week from eggs.

To calculate this, we need to first find out how many ounces of eggs Lloyd sells in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, and each day, Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs. So, in a week, Lloyd sells:

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week

Since each egg weighs 2 ounces, Lloyd sells:

1,764 eggs/week x 2 ounces/egg = 3,528 ounces of eggs/week

At $2/ounce, Lloyd makes:

3,528 ounces/week x $2/ounce = $7,056/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $7,056/week from eggs."	7056

Stephen ordered food online. His bill was reduced to $40.00. Because he went through a delivery person, they added 25% to his bill and charged him an additional $3.00 for delivery. Stephen added $4.00. After adding the additional charge, how much did Stephen pay for the food?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Stephen's bill was reduced to $40.00.
2. A 25% service charge was added, which is 25% of $40.00 = $10.00.
3. An additional delivery charge of $3.00 was added.
4. Stephen added $4.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen paid:

$40.00 (bill) + $10.00 (service charge) + $3.00 (delivery charge) + $4.00 (added by Stephen) = $57.00

So, Stephen paid a total of $57.00 for the food."	57

If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she earns a $50,000 annual salary. Starting at age 20, she gets 5% of the annual salary. If she leaves after 30 years, what will her annual salary be?

If Marcy starts working at the age of 20, she will be working for 40 years.

Her salary is $50,000 per year.

She gets 5% of her annual salary as a raise each year.

So, her salary after 1 year will be:

$50,000 x 1.05 = $52,500

Her salary after 2 years will be:

$52,500 x 1.05 = $55,125

Her salary after 30 years will be:

$55,125 x 1.05 = $58,187.50

So, Marcy's annual salary after 30 years will be $58,187.50."	58187

Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and spend half of that time reading. Three times a week, he does this. How many hours does he spend watching TV and studying in four weeks?

Answer:

To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and studying in four weeks, we need to first find out how many hours he spends on each activity in one week.

Jim spends two hours watching TV each day, so he spends a total of 2 x 7 = 14 hours watching TV in one week.

He also spends half of the time he spends watching TV reading, so he spends half of 14 hours reading, which is 14/2 = 7 hours reading in one week.

Therefore, in one week, Jim spends 14 hours watching TV and 7 hours reading.

To find out how many hours he spends on these activities in four weeks, we can simply multiply the number of hours he spends in one week by 4:

14 hours watching TV x 4 weeks = 56 hours watching TV
7 hours reading x 4 weeks = 28 hours reading

So, in four weeks, Jim spends 56 hours watching TV and 28 hours reading."	28

There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls for every 5 students, how many teachers are there?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

Let's say there are x teachers.

There are 60 girls for every 5 students, so there are 60/5 = 12 girls in every class.

Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 12 x 2 = 24 boys in every class.

Since there are x teachers, there are x + 24 boys in every class.

Since there are 5 classes, there are 5x + 120 boys in total.

We know that there are 60 girls in every class, so there are 60 x 5 = 300 girls in total.

Since there are 60 girls and 300 girls in total, there must be 300/60 = 5 teachers.

So, there are 5 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."	5

Judy teaches 5 dance classes a day on weekdays. She teaches 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she teaches each student $15.00, how much does she make in 1 week?

I need help with the calculations. 

Please help me.

Thank you.

Answer:

To calculate how much Judy makes in one week, we need to know how many classes she teaches in a week.

A week has 7 days, and Judy teaches 5 classes per day, so she teaches a total of 5 x 7 = 35 classes per week.

On Saturdays, she teaches 8 classes, so she teaches a total of 35 + 8 = 43 classes per week.

If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, then she earns:

43 classes x 15 students per class = 645 students per week

645 students x $15.00 per student = $9,675 per week

Therefore, Judy makes $9,675 per week."	9675

Shiela bought 5 mobile phones at a cost of $150 each and paid for them in 3 months. Each one with an interest rate of 2%. How much will Shiela pay per month for 3 months?

Answer: 
Shiela will pay $50 per month for 3 months.

Explanation:
The total cost of the 5 mobile phones is $150 x 5 = $750.
The interest rate is 2% per month, so the monthly interest is $750 x 2% = $15.
The monthly payment is $750 + $15 = $765.
Since Shiela is paying for 3 months, the total amount she will pay is $765 x 3 = $2295."	2295

If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, will he save money?

Answer: No, Artie will not save money.

Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the flowers, we need to multiply the number of pots of each type of flower by its price.

Marigold: 12 x $2.74 = $33.04
Petunia: 9 x $1.87 = $16.83
Begonia: 17 x $2.12 = $35.04

Total cost: $33.04 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.87

Since the total cost is more than $85, Artie will not save money."	85

2 cups/day x 185 days = 370 cups

So, in the first year, Cecilia will use a total of:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since a dog food bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 dog food bags in the first year."	5

If Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, then Sarah does four times as much laundry as David does. Calculate how many clothes Raymond and David do if Sarah's laundry weighs 400 pounds.

Please help me with this problem.

Answer:

Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so he does 1/2 of 400 pounds = 200 pounds.

David does 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, so David does 4 x 200 pounds = 800 pounds.

Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry and David does 800 pounds of laundry."	800

Dan planted three bunches of roses, each with 25 roses, each with eight thorns, and each bunch of roses was covered with thorns.

1. How many thorns did Dan plant in total?
2. How many bunches of roses did Dan plant in total?

Please show your calculations. Thank you.

Answer:

1. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of thorns in each bunch by the number of bunches:

8 x 25 = 200

So, Dan planted 200 thorns in total.

2. To find the total number of bunches of roses, we can multiply the number of bunches by the number of roses in each bunch:

The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for employees who have been with the company for five years.

The company pays its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for employees who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, how much salary will she earn annually after another three years working there?

Answer: $990 per month.

Explanation:

Sylvie started working for the company 5 years ago, so she has been with the company for 5 years.

The company's policy is to increase each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for employees who have been with the company for 5 years.

Therefore, after 5 years of working for the company, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of her starting salary, which is $600 per month.

New salary = $600 x 1.10 = $660 per month.

After another 3 years, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of her current salary, which is $660 per month.

New salary = $660 x 1.10 = $726 per month.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after another 3 years working for the company will be $726 per month."	726

Ted the T-Rex is planning to take a monkey to a dinosaur picnic. Does he know that each adult eats 10 pounds of monkeys and each child eats the middle of an adult's plate? If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the party, how many monkeys does Ted need to bring to the party if he expects to distribute them to everyone?

Hint: Think about the total number of monkeys that will be eaten by the adults and children.

Answer: 
Ted needs to bring 200 monkeys to the party.

Explanation:

There are 20 adults who each eat 10 pounds of monkeys, so they will eat a total of 200 pounds of monkeys (20 x 10).

There are 5 children who each eat the middle of an adult's plate, so they will eat a total of 50 pounds of monkeys (5 x 10).

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 monkeys to the party to ensure that everyone has enough to eat."	200
91	Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, and Marcia has two more than Cindy. If Cindy has four, how many pets do the three of them have in total?	28	"Answer only. 
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, and Marcia has two more than Cindy. If Cindy has four, how many pets do the three of them have in total?

Answer: 14

Explanation:
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 2 = 6 more pets than Marcia.
Marcia has two more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Therefore, the total number of pets owned by the three of them is:
6 + 6 + 6 = 18

However, the question states that Cindy has four pets, so the total number of pets owned by the three of them is:

Lee was able to sprint 400 meters at twice Gerald's speed, but Gerald changed his speed, increasing his speed by 10%. If Lee can sprint 400 meters in 38 seconds, how much speed can Gerald use since he changed his speed to sprint the same distance in 38 seconds?

Answer:

Gerald increased his speed by 10%, which means he increased his speed by 10/100 = 0.1 times his original speed.

So, Gerald's original speed was:

0.1 x 2 x 400/38 = 80 meters per second

Therefore, Gerald's original speed was 80 meters per second."	80

95	Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls, but how many girls are not members of the Girl Scouts?	40	"Answer only. 
Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls, but how many girls are not members of the Girl Scouts?

Let G be the number of girls in the class who are members of the Girl Scouts and let N be the number of girls in the class who are not members of the Girl Scouts.

Since two-thirds of the girls in the class are members of the Girl Scouts, we can write:

2/3G = 200

Since two-fifths of the students in the class are boys, we can write:

2/5(200 - G) = 20

Now we can solve the system of equations. First, we can solve the first equation for G:

G = 200 / 3

G = 66

Next, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

2/5(200 - 66) = 20

2/5(134) = 20

42.8 = 20

Therefore, there are 42 girls in the class who are not members of the Girl Scouts."	42

When Freda cooks canned onions into vegetables, they are reduced to a fraction of their original size. Each bowl of onions contains three onions. Freda's last bowl of onions weighed 32 ounces.

a) How many ounces did each onion weigh before it was cooked?

b) How many onions were in Freda's first bowl?

c) How many onions were in Freda's last bowl?

d) If Freda had cooked the onions for twice as long, how much would each onion have weighed after cooking?

e) If Freda had cooked the onions for three times as long, how much would each onion have weighed after cooking?

Please help me with this problem. Thank you.

I'm happy to help! Here are the answers to your questions:

a) To find out how many ounces each onion weighed before it was cooked, we need to divide the total weight of the onions in the last bowl by the number of onions in the last bowl. In this case, we can divide 32 ounces by 3 onions to get an average weight of 10.67 ounces per onion.

b) To find out how many onions were in Freda's first bowl, we can divide the total weight of the onions in the last bowl by the weight of a single onion. In this case, we can divide 32 ounces by 10.67 ounces per onion to get 3 onions in the first bowl.

c) To find out how many onions were in Freda's last bowl, we can simply multiply the number of onions in the first bowl by the number of bowls that Freda cooked. In this case, we can multiply 3 onions in the first bowl by 4 bowls to get 12 onions in the last bowl.

d) If Freda had cooked the onions for twice as long, we can assume that each onion would have been reduced to half its original size. So, we can divide the weight of each onion before cooking by "	12

Cars are parked on the main road. Some of the cars pass in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then another 20 cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 cars leave in a row with the intention of avoiding the traffic jam. If at the beginning there were 30 cars on this road, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Answer: 15 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Explanation:

Let X be the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

We know that 5 cars left in a row, so the number of cars remaining at the end of the first 15 minutes is:

30 - 5 = 25

We also know that 20 cars passed through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, so the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is:

X + 20

We can set up an equation to represent this information:

X + 20 = 25

Solving for X, we get:

X = 15

Therefore, 15 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."	15

Jerome was visited by four friends who came to visit him one day: The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, he rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first; the third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth; and if the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?

Answer: 90 times.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first, so he rang the doorbell 5 times (20 x 0.25 = 5).
3. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth, so he rang the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
4. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell rang:

5 + 20 + 70 + 60 = 90

Therefore, the doorbell rang 90 times."	90

A gas station sells it for $3.00 per gallon. The company's app charges $.20 per gallon to anyone who fills gas at the station. If a person buys more than 10 gallons of gas, how much will his gas be, after receiving a refund?

The amount of gas bought is 12 gallons. Calculate the total cost of gas, the amount of refund, and the final price of gas after the refund.

Please help me with the calculations.

Answer:

Total cost of gas = 12 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $36.00

Amount of refund = $36.00 x 0.20 per gallon = $7.20

Final price of gas after refund = $36.00 - $7.20 = $28.80

Therefore, the final price of gas after receiving a refund is $28.80."	28

The hospital treats 500 patients a day. Each patient is treated for a whopping 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these women?

The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of treatment from the revenue.

Profit = Revenue - Cost

In this case, the revenue is $200 per hour x 500 patients = $100,000 per day.

The cost of treatment is $150 per hour x 500 patients = $75,000 per day.

Profit = $100,000 - $75,000 = $25,000 per day."	25000

Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play strippers at her shop in the village of Santa. A third of the workers quit after being teased by the children, then another 10 quit after the children kicked their heads off. How many workers are left?

Answer: 40 workers are left.

Explanation:

* A third of the workers quit after being teased by the children, so 20 workers quit (3 x 60 = 20).
* Then, another 10 workers quit after the children kicked their heads off, so 10 more workers quit.
* In total, 20 + 10 = 30 workers quit.
* So, 60 - 30 = 40 workers are left."	40

Rory ordered 2 sub at $7.50 each, 2 packets of chips at $1.50 each and 2 cookies at $1.00 each for delivery. There are 20 parts shipping charges added to the bill and he wants to add $5.00 as a deposit. How much will the total order including shipping cost be?

Please help me with this. I'm stuck.

Answer:

The total order including shipping cost would be:

$7.50 x 2 = $15.00 (subs)
$1.50 x 2 = $3.00 (chips)
$1.00 x 2 = $2.00 (cookies)

Total food cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Shipping cost = 20 parts x $0.10 = $2.00

Deposit = $5.00

Total order including shipping cost = $20.00 + $2.00 + $5.00 = $27.00"	27

Answer: 10

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the total number of questions Mark completed in 8 hours:

5 questions/hour x 8 hours = 40 questions

Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Mark completed in 6 hours:

5 questions/hour x 6 hours = 30 questions

Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark had left over:

40 questions (completed in 8 hours) - 30 questions (completed in 6 hours) = 10 questions

Mark had 10 questions left over."	10

Please provide your answer in dollars, and please explain your reasoning.

Thank you for your time.

$2.90 x 3 clients = $8.70 per week (current income)

$8.70 x 5 potential clients = $43.50 per week (potential income)

Total weekly income = $8.70 + $43.50 = $52.20 per week

Profit = Total weekly income - Total weekly expenses

Total weekly expenses = $2 x 2 bottles of bottled water per client x 3 clients = $12
Total weekly expenses = $12 + $5 x 3 packs of clean clothes per client x 3 clients = $24

Profit = $52.20 - $36 = $16.20 per week

Therefore, Kim's weekly profit from her housekeeping business would be $16.20."	16

John has a ten-hectare (10-hectare) banana plantation, with 100 oranges per hectare. John can harvest his oranges every three months. How many oranges can John harvest in a year?

Answer: 

The area of John's banana plantation is 10 hectares, and he has 100 oranges per hectare, so the total number of oranges he has is:

10 hectares x 100 oranges/hectare = 1000 oranges

Since John can harvest his oranges every three months, he can harvest:

1000 oranges / 3 months = 333 oranges per month

Therefore, John can harvest 333 oranges per month, and in a year, he can harvest:

333 oranges/month x 12 months = 4000 oranges per year."	4000

149	Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many friends does James have?	16	"Answer only. 
Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many friends does James have?

Let x be the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.

Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, Charlie has 3x Facebook friends.

James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has 4x Facebook friends.

We know that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Now we can find out how many Facebook friends James has:

4x = 4(4) = 16

James has 16 Facebook friends."	16

Shawnda decides that the kids from the club can deliver the gas cooking service to the people. She decides that the best way to do it is to change the balls. Each ball is 25 cents. On the first day, five people will cook for them in both balls. 3 people will cook for them in all their balls. Finally, someone came with a bicycle. How many dollars did he make that day?

Let's break down the information we have:

1. Shawnda decides to have the kids from the club deliver the gas cooking service to the people.
2. Each ball is 25 cents.
3. On the first day, five people will cook for them in both balls.
4. Three people will cook for them in all their balls.
5. Someone came with a bicycle.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made on the first day:

1. Five people cooking in both balls:
5 x 2 = 10 balls
10 x 25 cents = $2.50
2. Three people cooking in all their balls:
3 x 2 = 6 balls
6 x 25 cents = $1.50
3. Someone came with a bicycle:
Let's assume the person brought 10 balls.
10 x 25 cents = $2.50

Adding up all the amounts, Shawnda made a total of:

$2.50 + $1.50 + $2.50 = $6.50

So, Shawnda made $6.50 on the first day."	6

The monkey needs 200 geese per month, so he needs 200 x 2 = 400 geese for two months.
The duck needs 400 geese per month, so he needs 400 x 2 = 800 geese for two months.
In total, the zookeeper needs 400 + 800 = 1200 geese to last two months.
However, since the zookeeper buys geese every two months, he needs to buy 1200 / 2 = 600 geese for each month. Therefore, he needs 600 x 2 = 3000 geese to last two months."	3000
157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run faster than the other in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a soccer field 100 yards long. Blake runs 15 laps. Kelly runs one lap, and decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she decides to run to the sound of 40 yards as he runs back. He does this 34 times. How much faster is the winner than the loser?	80	"Answer only. 
Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run faster than the other in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a soccer field 100 yards long. Blake runs 15 laps. Kelly runs one lap, and decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she decides to run to the sound of 40 yards as he runs back. He does this 34 times. How much faster is the winner than the loser?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Blake runs 15 laps on the soccer field, which is 100 yards long.
* Kelly runs one lap, then decides to run to the sound of 40 yards instead of running next to Blake.
* Kelly runs 34 times to the sound of 40 yards.

We need to find out how much faster the winner is than the loser. To do this, we need to find out how far Blake and Kelly ran in total.

Let's start with Blake. He ran 15 laps on the soccer field, which is 100 yards long. So, he ran a total of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly. She ran one lap on the soccer field, which is 100 yards long. So, she ran a total of 100 yards.

But then, she decided to run to the sound of 40 yards instead of running next to Blake. This means she ran an additional 40 yards. So, her total distance run is 100 + 40 = 140 yards.

Now, we can compare the total distance run by Blake and Kelly. Blake ran 1500 yards, while Kelly ran 140 yards.

To find out how much faster the winner is than the loser, we can divide the distance run by the winner by the distance run by the loser:

1500 / 140 = 10.71

So, the winner (Blake) is 10.71 times faster than the loser (Kelly)."	10

Jackie is trying to decide whether to work on her own taxes or hire an accountant. If she works on her own taxes, she will be able to do 3 hours of volunteer work, losing $35/hour in the time she spends without income. The accountant estimates $90. How much money would she have if she hired an accountant?

Can you help me with this problem?

I understand that the problem is asking how much money Jackie would have if she hires an accountant, but the information provided is not enough to determine the answer.

Here's why:

1. The problem states that Jackie would lose $35/hour for the 3 hours she spends working on her taxes, but it doesn't mention how much she would earn or save by hiring an accountant.
2. The problem mentions that the accountant estimates $90, but it doesn't specify how much of that amount would go to Jackie or how much would be used to cover the accountant's fees.

Without more information, it's not possible to determine how much money Jackie would have if she hires an accountant. Can you provide more details or clarify the question?"	90

For her 30th birthday, Elvina chooses a jewel-encrusted computer as a gift. She has a family budget of €1500 and thinks she will be able to save enough money to buy a dress. She goes to a computer store and chooses a €1090 device with a screen, keyboard and mouse. This also includes a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left over to buy her dress?

Answer:

Elvina will have €458 left over to buy her dress.

Explanation:

The total cost of the computer and accessories is:

1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423

Subtracting the total cost from the family budget:

1500 - 1423 = 458

Therefore, Elvina will have €458 left over to buy her dress."	458

Billy cooks and slices almonds in preparation for making almond salads for an outdoor dinner to be served at a family gathering. It's a big event, so he has 60 almonds to use. All the almonds are about the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to cook and slice each one. Billy cooks the almonds in one and a half minutes, but it takes him 5 seconds to slice them. How long will it take to finish cooking the almonds?

Answer: 90 seconds.

Explanation:

To find out how long it will take to finish cooking the almonds, we need to add the time it takes to cook the almonds to the time it takes to slice them.

Cooking time: 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds

Slicing time: 5 seconds

Total time: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 seconds to finish cooking the almonds."	95

Juan and his brother, Carlos, sell lemon juice for $3 a can and $2 a can of sugar, and each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans. If they made $25 in profit, how much would they have spent on the lemon?

Answer: $15

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Juan and Carlos sell lemon juice for $3 a can and $2 a can of sugar.
* Each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans.
* They made $25 in profit.

We can start by calculating the total amount of money Juan and Carlos made from selling lemon juice and sugar:

Total revenue from lemon juice = 20 cans x $3/can = $60
Total revenue from sugar = 20 cans x $2/can = $40
Total revenue = $60 + $40 = $100

Now, we know that their profit is $25. So, we can set up the equation:

$100 - $25 = $75

Now, we need to find out how much they spent on the lemon juice. Let's use the information that each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans:

$0.50 x 20 cans = $10

So, Juan and Carlos spent $10 on the lemon juice.

Therefore, the answer is $15."	15

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on gasoline, and the middle of the rest he gives to his loved ones. He gives his daughter $200 for his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for cooking and other household expenses. If Zaid lives on $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending on all of this and healing?

Answer: $200

Explanation:

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6000 x 1/4 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on gasoline, which is $6000 x 1/3 = $2000.

He gives the middle of the rest to his loved ones, which is $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500.

He gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses.

He gives his wife $700 for cooking and other household expenses.

So, Zaid will have $2500 - $200 - $700 = $200 left after spending on all of these and healing."	200

Sandra, a local florist, is deeply disappointed with Fred's failure to deliver her order. Sandra orders four times as many red carnations as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, five times as many white carnations. Sandra does not hesitate to change hands if the missing red carnations are not delivered by eleven o'clock in the evening.

Question: How many flowers of each type will Sandra have if Fred delivers all of the flowers on time?

I need help with the solution. 

Answer:

For red carnations, Sandra orders 4 times as many as white carnations, so she orders 4x = 4(100) = 400 red carnations.

For white carnations, Sandra orders 5 times as many as red carnations, so she orders 5x = 5(400) = 2000 white carnations.

For pink calla lilies, Sandra orders 200.

In total, Sandra will have 400 + 2000 + 200 = 2600 flowers."	2600
182	Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan. 5. If Jan is 30 years old, how old is Jena?	23	"Answer only. 
Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan. 5. If Jan is 30 years old, how old is Jena?

Answer: 32 years old.

Explanation:

Let's assume Mark's current age is M.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jean, so Mark's age two years ago is:

M - 2 = (1/2)J

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is:

J = M + 2

We also know that Jean is 30 years old, so we can set up the equation:

M + 2 = 30

Solving for M, we get:

M = 28

So Mark is currently 28 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is:

J = M + 2 = 28 + 2 = 30

Therefore, Jean is 30 years old."	30

184	Jerry rolls a six-way die. How many chances (expressed as a percentage) is he going to get on a number greater than 3 than if he rolls on two consecutive non-zero numbers?	25	"Answer only. 
Jerry rolls a six-way die. How many chances (expressed as a percentage) is he going to get on a number greater than 3 than if he rolls on two consecutive non-zero numbers?

If Jerry rolls a six-way die, each face has a number of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

To find the probability of getting a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of getting any number other than 3.

The probability of getting a number other than 3 is 5/6, or 83.33%.

Now, if Jerry rolls two consecutive non-zero numbers, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is higher. In this case, the probability is 2/3, or 66.67%.

So, Jerry is more likely to get a number greater than 3 by rolling two consecutive non-zero numbers than by rolling a six-way die."	3

Russell works at a small pet store and is distributing the seeds. The seeds are kept in 3 nets in equal groups and each net is given 6 seeds. There are 10 nets with hamster seeds separated and each hamster is given 5 seeds. There is also a red box containing 20 seeds. No seeds are used elsewhere in the store. If 160 seeds are divided into small seeds, how many seeds are in each net?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Total number of seeds: 160
2. Number of nets with hamster seeds: 10
3. Number of seeds in each net with hamster seeds: 5
4. Number of seeds in the red box: 20

Now, let's think about how we can divide the 160 seeds among the 10 nets with hamster seeds and the red box.

Since there are 10 nets with hamster seeds, we can divide 160 by 10 to find out how many seeds each net should get:

160 ÷ 10 = 16

So, each net with hamster seeds should get 16 seeds.

Now, let's think about the red box. We know there are 20 seeds in the red box, so we can add 20 to the number of seeds each net with hamster seeds should get:

16 + 20 = 36

So, each net with hamster seeds should get 36 seeds.

Therefore, the answer is 36 seeds in each net with hamster seeds."	36

188	The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If the transportation of each sack from the field to the warehouse would be $2, if the merchant made a profit of $400 in total after selling all the sacks at $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If the transportation of each sack from the field to the warehouse would be $2, if the merchant made a profit of $400 in total after selling all the sacks at $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?

Let x be the number of sacks sold.

Since the merchant made a profit of $400 in total, the total revenue from selling all the sacks is:

30x = 400

The total cost of buying and transporting all the sacks is:

20x + 2x = 20x + 2(x)

= 20x + 2x

= 22x

So, the merchant made a profit of:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= 30x - 22x
= 8x

Since the merchant made a profit of $400 in total, the total profit from selling all the sacks is:

8x = 400

x = 50

So, the merchant sold 50 sacks of wheat."	50

The three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to a trade show. They spent $4.40 for a meal below the ticket price. They also traveled on 2 separate trips for $33 each. If they decided to split the total cost equally, how much would each of them have paid?

Answer:
$33

Explanation:
To find out how much each of the three friends would pay, we need to first find the cost of the tickets and the meal.

Cost of tickets = $20.25 (given)
Cost of meal = $4.40 (given)

Total cost = $20.25 + $4.40 = $24.65

Since they traveled on 2 separate trips, they would pay $33 each for the trips, for a total of $66.

Therefore, each of the three friends would pay $66 / 3 = $33."	33
190	For three hours, John grinds a single grain of wheat at a rate of about two grains per minute.	360	"Answer only. 
For three hours, John grinds a single grain of wheat at a rate of about two grains per minute.
How many grains of wheat does John grind in three hours?

I can't do this problem. Can you help me?

Answer:

To find out how many grains of wheat John grinds in three hours, we need to know the rate at which he grinds the grains and the time he grinds for.

The problem states that John grinds at a rate of about two grains per minute. This means that in one minute, John grinds two grains of wheat.

To find out how many grains John grinds in three hours, we can multiply the number of grains per minute by the number of minutes he grinds for:

2 grains/minute x 3 hours = 6 grains

So, John grinds 6 grains of wheat in three hours."	6

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: 25 trees.

Explanation:

1. At the start, Tom has 50 trees.
2. Every year, he cuts down 2 trees, so he has 50 - 2 = 48 trees the next year.
3. After 10 years, he has 48 - 2 = 46 trees.
4. 30% of the trees die, so he loses 30% of 46 = 14 trees.
5. Therefore, he has 46 - 14 = 32 trees left.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 32 trees left."	32

In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Answer only. 
At the end of the month, Elaine collected three times as many Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?

Answer: 300 Pokemon cards.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information we know:

1. In the first month, Elaine collected three times as many Pokemon cards. So, if she collected x cards in the first month, she collected 3x cards.
2. In the second month, Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, if she collected 3x cards in the first month, she collected 3x - 20 cards in the second month.
3. In the third month, Elaine collected twice as many Pokemon cards as in the first and second months. So, if she collected 3x - 20 cards in the second month, she collected 2(3x - 20) cards in the third month.

Now, let's add up all the cards Elaine collected in each month:

Month 1: 3x cards = 3x
Month 2: 3x - 20 cards = 2x
Month 3: 2(3x - 20) cards = 2(2x) = 4x

Total cards: 3x + 2x + 4x = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9x

Since Elaine collected three times as many Pokemon cards in the first month, she collected 3x cards. Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has is 3x = 300."	300

Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert assigns six exercises for each lesson. He allows students to pick the numbers that are lower in the average for each lesson. Given that Brinley scores 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five exams, what marks does he need on the sixth exam to get the average score of 93?

(Note: The numbers are all whole numbers.)

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble understanding how to approach it. Thank you!

Answer:

To get an average score of 93, Brinley needs to have a score of 93 on the sixth exam.

Here's how we can calculate this:

1. Add up all of Brinley's scores:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
2. Divide the total by the number of exams:
448 ÷ 5 = 89.6
3. Round the average to the nearest whole number:
89.6 ≈ 93

So, Brinley needs to score 93 on the sixth exam to get an average score of 93."	93

209	Twenty cupcakes cost $1200 less than the average price of half a cup of onions which costs $6000 each. Count the total cost per cup.	145	"Answer only. 
Twenty cupcakes cost $1200 less than the average price of half a cup of onions which costs $6000 each. Count the total cost per cup.

Let's assume that the average price of half a cup of onions is x dollars.

According to the problem, 20 cupcakes cost $1200 less than the price of half a cup of onions. So, we can write:

20 cupcakes = x - $1200

We know that the cost of half a cup of onions is $6000, so we can write:

x = 6000

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the first equation:

20 cupcakes = 6000 - $1200

20 cupcakes = 4800

So, the total cost per cup is:

4800 / 20 = $240

Therefore, the total cost per cup is $240."	240

Lori wants to buy a pair of $320 shoes and a matching belt for $32.00 She has a job that pays $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work to buy what she wants?

Answer: 40 hours.

Explanation:

To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then divide that number by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the shoes and belt is:

$320 + $32 = $352

Lori earns $8.00 per hour, so we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work as follows:

$352 / $8.00 per hour = 40 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 40 hours to buy the shoes and belt."	40

If she were to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would she have left over during that time?

Answer: $1,980

Explanation:

To find out how much money she would have left over, we need to subtract the total amount she paid ($1,980) from the original amount of money she had ($2,000).

$2,000 - $1,980 = $20

So, she would have $20 left over after paying $165 a month for 12 months."	12

225	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 green cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 of the water cards and buys 14 of the green cards, what are the odds (numbered to the nearest whole number) that the most likely card will be the water card?	9	"Answer only. 
James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 green cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 of the water cards and buys 14 of the green cards, what are the odds (numbered to the nearest whole number) that the most likely card will be the water card?

I believe this is a classic problem of conditional probability, where we are given two events, the first event is losing 8 water cards, and the second event is buying 14 green cards.

Let's define the events A and B as follows:

A = losing 8 water cards
B = buying 14 green cards

We are interested in the probability of event A given event B, i.e., P(A|B).

To find P(A|B), we need to find the probability of event B given event A, i.e., P(B|A).

We can calculate P(B|A) as follows:

P(B|A) = (number of green cards after A) / (number of water cards before A)

We know that after losing 8 water cards, James has 30 - 8 = 22 water cards left.

We also know that he buys 14 green cards, so the number of green cards after A is:

14 + (22 - 8) = 14 + 14 = 28

So, P(B|A) = 28 / 22 = 2.

Now, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B) = 14 / (30 + 20 + 40) = 14 / 90 = 1/6

P(A) = 30 / (30 + 20 + 40) = 30 / 90 = 1/3

P(B|A) = 28 / 22 = 2

Now we can plug in the values to Bayes' theorem:

Calinda works on a 360-degree rotor with her mother. Under normal conditions, Calinda can add up to 4 parts per minute. Calinda's mother can add up as many parts per minute as she can by dividing Calinda's parts in half. How many hours will it take them to complete the rotor?

Answer: 40 hours.

Explanation: Calinda can add 4 parts per minute, so she can add 240 parts in an hour (4 x 60). Her mother can add half of that amount, which is 120 parts per hour (240 / 2). Therefore, together they can add 360 parts per hour (240 + 120). To complete the rotor, they will need to add 360 x 40 = 14,400 parts. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they will need 14,400 / 60 = 240 hours. However, there are 24 hours in a day, so they will need 240 / 24 = 40 days to complete the rotor."	40

Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30 percent of the melons were ripe, which she took home. When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, which she harvested. How many melons were not ripe two weeks later?

Answer: 30% of the melons were not ripe two weeks later.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 30% of the melons were ripe two months later.
2. Three quarters of the remaining melons were ripe two weeks later.

We can start by finding out how many melons were not ripe two months later:

30% of the melons = 30% of (100 - 30) = 30% of 70 = 21

So, 21 melons were not ripe two months later.

Now, let's find out how many melons were not ripe two weeks later:

Three quarters of the remaining melons = Three quarters of (100 - 21) = Three quarters of 79 = 79 \* 3/4 = 59

Mark buys his company a fleet of 12 cars. Each car costs $20,000. He paid 10% interest on the cars and paid $1000 to register each of them. How much does he pay for each one?

Answer:

To find out how much Mark pays for each car, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars first.

Total cost of cars = 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the cars.

Interest on cars = Total cost of cars x 10% = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Now, we need to add the interest and the registration fee to find out the total cost of each car.

Total cost of each car = $20,000 (purchase price) + $2,400 (interest) + $1,000 (registration fee) = $23,400

Therefore, Mark pays $23,400 for each car."	23400

When Dax went to the apple orchard to pick apples, he noticed that the number of insects in the orchard was more than half the number of apples in the garden.

If the number of apples in the garden was 360, how many insects were in the orchard?

Answer: 210.

Explanation: Let X be the number of insects in the orchard. Since the number of insects is more than half the number of apples, we know that X > (360/2) = 180.

So, X = 210."	210

233	Steve decides to start eating more peanuts and grows more cherries. He eats twice as many peanuts as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a root produces 3 peanuts a week, how many peanuts does he need?	12	"Answer only. 
Steve decides to start eating more peanuts and grows more cherries. He eats twice as many peanuts as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a root produces 3 peanuts a week, how many peanuts does he need?

Answer:

Let X be the number of roots he needs.

Since he eats 6 peanuts a day and his girlfriend eats twice as many, she eats 6 x 2 = 12 peanuts a day.

If a root produces 3 peanuts a week, then Steve needs X roots to produce 3 x X peanuts a week.

Since Steve needs 6 peanuts a day, he needs X roots to produce 6 x 7 = 42 peanuts a week.

Therefore, Steve needs 42 peanuts a week."	42

The number of students in a classroom was 1000. The classroom had 3 entrances A, B and C as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B and the rest left through door C, count the number of students who left through door C.

Answer: 500 students.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of students who left through door C.

Since 30% of the students left through door A, 30% of 1000 is 300 students left through door A.

3/5 of the students left through door B, so 3/5 of 1000 is 600 students left through door B.

So, the total number of students who left the building = 300 + 600 = 900.

Since all the students who did not leave through doors A and B left through door C, the number of students who left through door C is 900 - 300 - 600 = 500."	500
239	James has six more candles than Robert does, and John has twice as many as Robert does. If John has 54 candles, how many more candles does John have than James does?	280	"Answer only. 
James has six more candles than Robert does, and John has twice as many as Robert does. If John has 54 candles, how many more candles does John have than James does?

Solution:

Let's start by letting R be the number of candles Robert has.

Since James has six more candles than Robert, James has R + 6 candles.

Since John has twice as many candles as Robert, John has 2R candles.

We know that John has 54 candles, so we can set up the equation:

R + 6 + 2R = 54

Simplifying the equation:

3R + 6 = 54

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

3R = 48

Dividing both sides by 3:

R = 16

So, Robert has 16 candles.

Now, we can find out how many more candles John has than James:

John has 2R = 2(16) = 32 candles more than James.

Therefore, John has 32 more candles than James."	32

Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If Dolly and Pandora both read each other's books and read theirs, how many books will they end up reading together?

I'm looking for an answer of 3, not 4.

Here's how I got 3:

Dolly reads Pandora's book, so Dolly reads one book.
Pandora reads Dolly's book, so Pandora reads one book.
Dolly and Pandora together read two books (their own books).

241	Mike's friendships with people of other races were cut short when he lost two of them. Each of them sends two letters a week, each letter about five feet long. He writes a letter again and again. He can write a whole chapter every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing?	6	"Answer only. 
Mike's friendships with people of other races were cut short when he lost two of them. Each of them sends two letters a week, each letter about five feet long. He writes a letter again and again. He can write a whole chapter every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing?

Answer:

Mike can write a whole chapter every six minutes, and each chapter is five feet long. Therefore, he can write five feet of chapter every six minutes.

Since each of his friends sends two letters a week, and each letter is five feet long, Mike receives a total of ten feet of letters from each friend per week (2 letters x 5 feet per letter).

Therefore, Mike spends 10 feet x 2 friends = 20 feet of writing per week, or 20 hours per week (20 feet / 6 minutes per foot).

So, Mike spends 20 hours per week writing letters to his friends."	20

Jason had a 1,000-minute-a-month phone schedule: 15 minutes a day on the phone with his boss, and 300 extra minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if the month has 30 days?

Answer: 
Jason has 250 minutes left if the month has 30 days.

Explanation:

Total minutes available = 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes

Minutes used = 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes

Minutes left = Total minutes available - Minutes used = 450 - 450 = 250 minutes"	250

244	There are 4 algae in one pond and 32 algae in the other. The difference in the number of algae in the two ponds is twice the number of fish in the two ponds. If the two ponds have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each pond?	20	"Answer only. 
There are 4 algae in one pond and 32 algae in the other. The difference in the number of algae in the two ponds is twice the number of fish in the two ponds. If the two ponds have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each pond?

Let's say there are x fish in each pond.

The number of algae in the first pond is 4x.
The number of algae in the second pond is 32x.

The difference in the number of algae in the two ponds is twice the number of fish in the two ponds:

4x - 32x = 2(x)

Simplify the equation:

4x - 32x = 2x

Solve for x:

-28x = 0

x = 0

Therefore, there are 0 fish in each pond."	0

On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister, on Tuesday she ate twice as many cookies, on Monday she ate five cookies, and on the following day she ate 13 cookies.

How many cookies did Sue eat in total?

Solve the problem.

Answer: 
Sue ate a total of 20 cookies.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of cookies that Sue's sister ate on Monday.

Since Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as she ate on Monday, so she ate 2(4x) = 8x cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 4x + 8x = 12x cookies.

Since Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can find the value of x by substituting these values into the equation:

4x + 8x = 12x

9x = 18

x = 2

Therefore, Sue's sister ate 2 cookies on Monday, and Sue ate 4(2) = 8 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2(8) = 16 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 8 + 16 = 24 cookies."	24
