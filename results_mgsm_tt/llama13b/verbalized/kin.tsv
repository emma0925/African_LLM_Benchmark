1	The scope takes two blue circles and a half a white circle. How many red circles do you use?	3	"Answer only. 
The scope takes two blue circles and a half a white circle. How many red circles do you use?

I know this is a classic puzzle, but I'm having trouble understanding the solution. Can you help me out?

Answer: 1 red circle.

Explanation:

The scope takes two blue circles and a half a white circle, which means it takes two blue circles and one half of a white circle. Since a white circle is made up of two halves, we can use one half of a white circle to complete the scope's requirements. Therefore, we need one red circle to complete the scope's requirements."	1

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many rabbits do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many rabbits do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?

Here's the information given:

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle.
Seattle has 20 sheep.

Let's start by finding out how many sheep Toulouse has:

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep.

Now, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has:

Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Now, let's find out how many sheep Seattle has:

Seattle has 20 sheep.

So, the total number of sheep for all three cities is:

Toulouse: 8
Charleston: 80
Seattle: 20

Now, we need to find out how many rabbits each city has. We are given that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse also has twice as many rabbits as Charleston. Charleston has 80 sheep, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 rabbits.

Charleston has 80 sheep, so it has 80 x 4 = 320 rabbits.

Seattle has 20 sheep, so it has 20 x 4 = 80 rabbits.

So, the total number of rabbits for all three cities is:

Toulouse: 160
Charleston: 320
Seattle: 80

Therefore, the total number of sheep and rabbits for all three cities is:

Toulouse: 8 + 160 = 168
Charleston: 80 + 320 = 400
Seattle: 20 + 80 = 100"	100

10	The new app had 60 downloads in the first month, a threefold increase in the number of downloads in the second month, but a 30% decrease in the third month. How many files did the app download in three months?	366	"Answer only. 
The new app had 60 downloads in the first month, a threefold increase in the number of downloads in the second month, but a 30% decrease in the third month. How many files did the app download in three months?

Answer: 252.

Explanation:

In the first month, the app downloaded 60 files.

In the second month, the app downloaded 60 x 3 = 180 files (threefold increase).

In the third month, the app downloaded 180 x 0.7 = 126 files (30% decrease).

Therefore, the total number of files downloaded in three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 252."	252

Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of breads, bought 3 packs of cumin bread at $68 per dozen, 2 small packs at $80 per pack. 6 boxes of ten and 2 small biscuits at $55 per box. How much did it cost in total?

What is the cost of the cumin bread in total?

How many boxes of ten are there in the total cost?

How many small biscuits are there in the total cost?

How much is the total cost of the small biscuits?

Answer:

Total cost = $68 x 3 + $80 x 2 + $55 x 6 + $55 x 2 = $220 + $160 + $330 + $110 = $820

Cost of cumin bread in total = $68 x 3 + $80 x 2 = $220

Number of boxes of ten = $330 / $55 = 6

Number of small biscuits = $110 / $55 = 2

Total cost of small biscuits = $110"	110
12	If Carlos plants a lemon tree for you, it will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year it will produce 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and cover it. How many years will it take before he starts to see the fruit of this lemon tree?	13	"Answer only. 
If Carlos plants a lemon tree for you, it will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year it will produce 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and cover it. How many years will it take before he starts to see the fruit of this lemon tree?

Answer: 4 years.

Explanation:

Cost of planting the tree = $90

Yearly revenue from selling lemons = 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50

Yearly expenses for watering and covering the tree = $3

Profit = Revenue - Expenses
= $10.50 - $3
= $7.50

Since the profit is positive, the lemon tree will start producing fruit in 4 years, which is the time it takes for the investment to pay off."	4

14	In a dance school with 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% are enrolled in jazz, and the rest are enrolled in hip-hop. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in hip-hop?	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance school with 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% are enrolled in jazz, and the rest are enrolled in hip-hop. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in hip-hop?

Please provide the steps to solve this problem.

Thank you.

Answer:

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop, we need to use the information that 20% of the students are enrolled in modern dance and 25% are enrolled in jazz.

Let's say x is the number of students enrolled in hip-hop.

We know that the total number of students is 20, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 20% of 20 = 20

where 20% of 20 is 4 (20 x 0.20).

Now we can solve for x:

x + 4 = 20

x = 16

So, there are 16 students enrolled in hip-hop, which is 80% of the total number of students (16/20 x 100%)."	100

The retailer wants to choose what to buy between 2 options. Jewelry worth $5000 or electronics worth $8000. His advisor mathematically predicts that the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% while the electronics market will grow by 1.2% in the same month. If the retailer wants to increase its monthly profit by using options, how much profit will he have?

If the retailer buys $5000 worth of jewelry, he will make a profit of $125 (2.5% of $5000).
If the retailer buys $8000 worth of electronics, he will make a profit of $96 (1.2% of $8000).

So, the retailer should buy $5000 worth of jewelry to maximize his profit."	5000

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, this one has one-third water and I want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which has three-fifths water. But when I poured it again I took 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice, this one has one-third water and I want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which has three-fifths water. But when I poured it again I took 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?

So, you have 10 liters of orange juice that is one-third water, and you want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water. After you add them together, you take out 1 liter of orange juice.

So, the total amount of juice you have is:

10 liters x 1/3 = 3.33 liters of water (from the orange juice)
15 liters x 3/5 = 9 liters of water (from the pineapple juice)

Total amount of water: 3.33 liters + 9 liters = 12.33 liters

So, there are 12.33 liters of water left in 24 liters."	24
21	If Raymond and Samantha had children, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Answer only. 
If Raymond and Samantha had children, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Answer: 5 years ago.

Explanation:

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond was born when Samantha was 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old, so Raymond was 23 - 6 = 17 years old when his son was born.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 31 - 17 = 14 years ago."	14

Henry stopped twice while riding his bicycle for 60 kilometers. The first time he stopped after 20 kilometers. He stopped again 15 kilometers before completing his journey. How many kilometers did he walk between his first stop and his last stop?

Answer: 5 kilometers.

Explanation:
Henry stopped for the first time after 20 kilometers, so he had traveled 20 + 5 = 25 kilometers before his first stop.

Therefore, he walked 5 kilometers between his first and second stops."	5

34	Siobhan has 2 more rings than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more rings than half of Raymond's rings. If Raymond has 40 rings, how many rings does Siobhan have?	23	"Answer only. 
Siobhan has 2 more rings than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more rings than half of Raymond's rings. If Raymond has 40 rings, how many rings does Siobhan have?

Let's use algebra to solve this problem.

Let R be the number of rings Raymond has.

We know that Aaron has 5 more rings than half of Raymond's rings, so Aaron has:

5 + (R/2) rings

We also know that Siobhan has 2 more rings than Aaron, so Siobhan has:

5 + (R/2) + 2 rings

We are told that Raymond has 40 rings, so we can set up the equation:

R = 40

Substituting this into the equation for Siobhan's rings, we get:

5 + (40/2) + 2 = 5 + 20 + 2 = 27

Therefore, Siobhan has 27 rings."	27

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They now sell 4 yogurts for $5.00 How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?

Answer:

Terry spends $30 on yogurt in 30 days.

To calculate this, we need to know that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, and there are 30 days in a month. So, he eats a total of 60 yogurts in 30 days.

Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, Terry spends $5.00 x 60 / 4 = $30 on yogurt in 30 days."	30

39	Dana can run at four times the speed of walking, but she can jump at half the speed of running. If she can jump 3 kilometers per hour, how many kilometers can she walk in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run at four times the speed of walking, but she can jump at half the speed of running. If she can jump 3 kilometers per hour, how many kilometers can she walk in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?

Answer: 2 km

Explanation:

Let's say Dana spends x hours walking and y hours running.

Since she can walk at 2 km/h, she can walk x kilometers in 6 hours:

2x = 6

x = 3

Since she can run at 4 times the speed of walking, she can run y kilometers in 6 hours:

4y = 6

y = 1.5

Since she spends one third of the time running, she spends 2/3 of the time walking:

x + y = 6

3x + 1.5y = 6

3x + 1.5(2) = 6

3x + 3 = 6

3x = 3

x = 1

So Dana spends 1 hour running and 5 hours walking.

Since she can jump 3 kilometers per hour, she can jump 3 kilometers in 1 hour:

3(1) = 3

She can walk 5 kilometers in 5 hours:

5(2) = 10

Total distance traveled = 3 + 10 = 13 kilometers.

Therefore, Dana can walk 13 kilometers in 6 hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking."	6

A giant dragon, the perg, sat on top of a farbo hill, breathing fire at anything within 1,000 meters. Polly could throw a golden javelin, the only known weapon that could hit a dragon, a distance of 400 meters, precisely with the fire of a serpent. But while polly held a sapphire stone, she could throw a spear three times as fast as without holding a gemstone. If she held a gemstone, how far from the fire of a serpent could polly stand on and still be able to hit a serpent with a javelin spear?

I'm having trouble understanding the question. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you're asking?

Here's what I understand so far:

* There is a giant dragon (the perg) that sits on top of a farbo hill.
* Polly can throw a golden javelin (the only known weapon that can hit a dragon) a distance of 400 meters.
* If Polly holds a sapphire stone, she can throw a spear three times as fast as without holding a gemstone.
* The question is asking about how far from the fire of a serpent Polly can stand and still be able to hit a serpent with a javelin spear.

I'm not sure what the fire of a serpent has to do with the question, or what the distance of 1,000 meters has to do with anything. Could you please provide more information or clarify what you're asking?"	1000

43	According to nutritional data, a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Answer only. 
According to nutritional data, a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?

Solve for x.

I know how to do this, but I'm not sure how to write it down. 

Can you please help me?

Thank you!

Answer: Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve for x, we need to use the information that you have already eaten 1800 calories and your daily goal is 2000 calories. We can start by writing down the equation:

1800 + x = 2000

where x is the number of calories in the bag of fiber.

Next, we can use the information that a serving of fiber has 250 calories to find out how many servings you can eat:

x = 2000 - 1800

x = 200

Now we know that you can eat 200 grams of fiber. To find out how many servings this is, we can divide the number of calories in a serving by the number of calories you can eat:

250 calories / 200 calories = 5 servings

So, you can eat 5 servings of fiber.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."	5
44	Charlie wants to sell candlesticks. For every pound of candlesticks he can make 10 closed candlesticks. A pound of candlesticks and whiskey costs $10.00 per pound. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what's the profit if he makes a kid who sells 20 candlesticks?	20	"Answer only. 
Charlie wants to sell candlesticks. For every pound of candlesticks he can make 10 closed candlesticks. A pound of candlesticks and whiskey costs $10.00 per pound. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what's the profit if he makes a kid who sells 20 candlesticks?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Charlie can make 10 closed candlesticks for every pound of candlesticks he has.
2. A pound of candlesticks and whiskey costs $10.00.
3. Charlie sells each candlestick for $2.00.
4. The kid sells 20 candlesticks.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find Charlie's profit:

First, we need to find out how much money Charlie will make from selling all 20 candlesticks. To do this, we can multiply the number of candlesticks by the price he sells them for:

20 candlesticks x $2.00 per candlestick = $40.00

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the materials and whiskey from the total amount of money Charlie will make:

$40.00 - $10.00 (cost of materials and whiskey) = $30.00

So, Charlie will make a profit of $30.00 from selling 20 candlesticks."	20

Please help me solve this problem. Thank you!

Answer:

Let X be the number of post-it notes in the package Candice bought.

We know that Candice used 220 post-it notes at work, so the number of post-it notes left in her inventory is:

23 = X - 220

We can solve for X by adding 220 to both sides of the equation:

X = 23 + 220

X = 243

So, there were 243 post-it notes in the package Candice bought."	243

Stephen ordered the vegetables from the website. He was paid $40 in the end. Because this was through the retailer, they deducted 25% from his final payment and charged him $3.00 in the processing fee.Stephen added $4.00 after the additional cost, What was the final price of Stephen's vegetables?

Answer:

First, let's calculate the amount deducted by the retailer:

25% of $40 = $10

So, the amount deducted by the retailer is $10.

Now, let's calculate the final price of the vegetables:

$40 - $10 = $30

Adding the additional cost of $4.00, we get:

$30 + $4.00 = $34

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's vegetables is $34."	34

If Mercy works for the company for 40 years, she earns an annual savings of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she will be entitled to a 5% annual savings bonus. If she retires after 30 years, what will her savings be per year?

Answer: $85,000 per year.

Explanation:

1. Calculate the total savings for 30 years:

30 years x $50,000 per year = $1,500,000

2. Calculate the 5% annual savings bonus for 20 years:

20 years x $50,000 per year x 5% = $500,000

3. Add the total savings and the bonus:

$1,500,000 + $500,000 = $2,000,000

Therefore, Mercy's savings per year after retiring after 30 years will be $85,000 per year ($2,000,000 / 24 years)."	24

Answer: $1,040

Explanation:

First half of the year:

* Subscription fee: $140/month x 6 months = $840
* Discount for first half of the year: 10% of $840 = $84

Total paid for first half of the year: $840 - $84 = $756

Second half of the year:

* Subscription fee: $140/month x 6 months = $840
* Discount for second half of the year: 10% of $840 = $84

Total paid for second half of the year: $840 - $84 = $756

Total paid for the year: $756 + $756 = $1,512

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the website at the end of the year is $1,512."	1512

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then goes to bed and reads a book half the time. He does this 3 times a week. And how many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each day, so he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week.
He spends half the time reading, so he spends 6 x 0.5 = 3 hours reading per week.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends:

6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV
3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours reading

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 24 + 12 = 36 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks."	4

Bailey started with a certain amount of money. Now he receives a weekly donation of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if he has $100 in total, how much did Bailey start with?

Answer: Bailey started with $80.

Explanation:

Let's say Bailey started with x dollars.

After 8 weeks, he received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so he received a total of $5 x 8 = 40 dollars.

So, the total amount Bailey has now is x + 40.

We know that Bailey has $100 in total, so we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

Solving for x, we get:

x = 80

So, Bailey started with $80."	80

If Raymond did half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah did 4 times as much laundry as David did, what is the difference in the number of laundries Raymond and David did if Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry?

Answer: 100 pounds

Explanation:
Let's say Raymond did x pounds of laundry.
Since Sarah did 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, Sarah did 4x pounds of laundry.
David did 400 - 4x pounds of laundry.

We know that Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 400 - 4x = 400

Simplifying the equation:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 50

So, Raymond did 50 pounds of laundry and David did 400 - 50 = 350 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the number of laundries Raymond and David did is:

350 - 50 = 100 pounds."	100

Vicent can buy a 3-pack of flowers for $2.50 or a 2-pack of flowers for $1. How much money will he save by buying 18 flowers at the right price?

Answer:

To find out how much money Vicent will save by buying 18 flowers at the right price, we need to calculate the cost of 18 flowers at both prices.

1. 3-pack of flowers for $2.50:
18 flowers = 6 x 3 = 18 x $2.50 = $45
2. 2-pack of flowers for $1:
18 flowers = 9 x 2 = 18 x $1 = $18

Now, we can calculate the difference between the two prices:

$45 - $18 = $27

Therefore, Vicent will save $27 by buying 18 flowers at the right price."	18

Grace weighs 125 kilograms. Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than four times Grace's weight. How much do they weigh in total?

Answer:

Grace weighs 125 kg.
Alex weighs 2 kg less than 4 times Grace's weight, so:
Alex weighs 4 x 125 kg - 2 kg = 495 kg - 2 kg = 493 kg.

88	Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies in total, how many copies did Harald sell?	8000	"Answer only. 
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies in total, how many copies did Harald sell?

I'm sorry, but I don't understand the question. Could you please clarify or provide more information?

Answer:

The question is asking for the number of copies that Harald sold, based on the information that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold a total of 88,000 copies, and Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, then we can set up the following equation:

Marilyn's sales = 10 x Harald's sales

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

Marilyn's sales + Harald's sales = 88,000

Substituting the equation for Marilyn's sales, we get:

10 x Harald's sales + Harald's sales = 88,000

Simplifying, we get:

10 x Harald's sales = 88,000 - Harald's sales

Solving for Harald's sales, we get:

Harald's sales = 8,800

Therefore, Harald sold 8,800 copies of his record."	8800

Let X be the number of girls not scouts.

We know that there are 5,2/5th graders and 2/3 boys and girls scouts.

So, the number of boys and girls scouts is:

2/3 x 5,2 = 3,42

Now, we know that there are 5,2/5th graders and 3,42 scouts.

So, the number of girls not scouts is:

5,2 - 3,42 = 1,78

The third friend refused an additional 10 times as much as the fourth friend. if the fourth friend refused an additional 60 times, how many times did Jerome cry altogether?

Let's call the number of times Jerome cried x.

We know that the first friend said an additional 20 times before Jerome opened the door, so the first friend said a total of 20 + x times.

We also know that the second friend refused to become Jerome's first friend, so the second friend said no additional times.

The third friend refused an additional 10 times as much as the fourth friend, so the third friend refused an additional 10 \* 60 = 600 times.

In total, Jerome cried x + 20 + 600 times."	600

Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour of his favorite episode that aired every night. On Wednesday he watched a few episodes of 30 minutes. On Thursday he finished his homework early and watched an episode of 1 hour and 30 minutes. On Friday he stayed up late for the weekend, so he watched two episodes of one hour each. If he watched 7 TV shows in total, what episode of 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's break down the information we have:

1. Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night.
2. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour of his favorite episode that aired every night.
3. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of 30 minutes.
4. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an episode of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
5. On Friday, he stayed up late for the weekend, so he watched two episodes of one hour each.

Let's use a list to organize the information:

1. Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour of favorite episode
2. Wednesday: 30 minutes of episodes
3. Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes of episode
4. Friday: 2 hours of episodes

Now, let's find out how many hours Frankie watched in total:

1. Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours (1 hour x 2 days)
2. Wednesday: 30 minutes (30 minutes)
3. Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (1 hour + 30 minutes)
4. Friday: 2 hours (2 hours)

Total hours watched by Frankie: 2 + 30 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

Since Frankie watched 7 TV shows in total, we can calculate the length of each show:

7 TV shows x 30 minutes per show = 210 minutes (210/7 = 30 minutes per show)

So, the episode of 30 minutes that Frankie watched on"	30

Marcell and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most fruit, so they take as many as they can, unless someone made a mistake and Beatrice had to take two and twenty-four cubits of a circle while Marcell had three and fourteen cubits. If they both ate all their money, how much did they eat?

Hint: One cubit is equal to 24 apples.

Please help me with this problem, I'm having trouble understanding it. Thank you!

Hello! I'd be happy to help you with this problem. Here's how I would approach it:

First, let's start by converting the measurements of fruit into apples. We know that one cubit is equal to 24 apples, so:

* Beatrice had 2 and 24 cubits of fruit, which is equal to 2 x 24 = 48 apples.
* Marcell had 3 and 14 cubits of fruit, which is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 apples.

Now, we know that both Beatrice and Marcell ate all their fruit, so we can add up the number of apples they ate:

48 + 72 = 120 apples

So, in total, Beatrice and Marcell ate 120 apples.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."	120

The jamal phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times more than the number of birds in jamal's photos. If the jamal phone can store 1800 photos, how many pictures can be found in jamal's photos?

Answer: 1080

Explanation:

Let x be the number of birds in Jamal's photos.

According to the problem, Brittany's phone can store 50 times more photos than Jamal's phone. Therefore, the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50x.

We know that the Jamal phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so the number of photos the Jamal phone can store is 6 x 50x = 6 x 50 = 300.

Since the Jamal phone can store 1800 photos, we know that 1800 = 300x.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1800 / 300

x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photos.

So, the answer is 6."	6

She was left with ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also had five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she decided to sell them all, how much would she make?

Answer:

To find out how much Sasha would make by selling all the wood, we need to calculate the total cost of the wood first.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 x $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 x $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of the wood is $100 + $80 = $180.

If Sasha sells all the wood for the same price she paid for it, she will make $180."	180

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack Julia bought?

Answer: 8.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. Julia bought a pack of spoons.
2. She used 3 spoons to cool her soup.
3. She had a total of 12 spoons at the table.

Now, let's think about how many spoons Julia bought. We know that she used 3 spoons to cool her soup, so we can subtract 3 from the total number of spoons she had:

12 - 3 = 9

So, Julia bought a pack of 9 spoons."	9

Brian's friend Bobby has 5 video games which is at least 3 times as many video games as Brian has. If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison was made, how many video games does Bobby have?

Let's say Brian has x video games.

After losing 5, Brian has x - 5 video games.

If Bobby has at least 3 times as many video games as Brian has, Bobby has:

3(x - 5) = 3x - 15

145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple farm. On each hectare there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Answer only. 
John has 10 hectares of pineapple farm. On each hectare there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?

Answer:

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate how many pineapples he can harvest per hectare and then multiply that by the number of hectares he has.

Since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (3 months x 4 times = 12 months).

So, if John has 10 hectares of pineapples and each hectare has 100 pineapples, he can harvest:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare x 4 harvests/year = 4,000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4,000 pineapples in a year."	4000

Answer: 60 bees came back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Explanation:

1. 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. 1/2 of the bees that were going to come back in the next 6 hours returned, which is 1/2 of 30 = 15 bees.
3. Twice as many bees returned as had left, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.
4. All the bees that had gone before but had not returned returned to the hive in the next 6 hours, which is 15 bees (as they had gone out in the first 6 hours).

Therefore, a total of 60 bees came back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."	6

Answer: 27

Explanation:

When Dave bought the packet of French fries, there were 27 fries in the packet.

19 fries were eaten by Dave before the bird stole the packet.

The bird ate half of the remaining fries, which is 9 fries (since 9 is half of 18).

3 pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 x 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.

Marcoun stole 2 fries, leaving 5 fries remaining.

The ants took the last 5 fries, leaving none.

Therefore, there were 27 fries in the packet when Dave bought them."	27

Bill cooks 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day.Each roll is 4 centimeters long, each croissant is 6 centimeters long, and each baguette is 2 meters long.If Bill puts all of these cooked products together, how long will it take them to cook?

Answer:

To find the total length of all the cooked products, we need to add the length of each item:

300 rolls x 4 cm/roll = 1200 cm
120 chocolate croissants x 6 cm/croissant = 720 cm
60 baguettes x 2 m/baguette = 1200 cm

Adding all these lengths together gives us a total length of:

Blake and Kelly have a competition to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes.They decide to do it on a 100-yard football field.Blake runs 15 times.Kelly runs once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running on the 40-yard line back and forth.He does this 34 times.How much faster does the winner run than the loser?

Let's call the winner's speed W and the loser's speed L.

Blake runs 15 times, so he covers 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs 34 times on the 40-yard line, so she covers 34 x 40 = 1360 yards.

Since Kelly runs back and forth, she covers twice the distance of the 40-yard line, so her total distance is 2 x 1360 = 2720 yards.

Now we can set up the equation to find the difference in speed:

W - L = (1500 - 2720) / 1500

Simplifying, we get:

W - L = -1220 / 1500

W - L = -0.8133 or approximately 0.8133 x 100 = 81.33%

So the winner runs at a speed of approximately 81.33% faster than the loser."	81

There are four birds on Caboose.Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four.If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, and Sally Thirty-two is 8, how old are these birds at the same time?

Here's the information provided:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two.
4. Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.

Let's start by analyzing the information we have:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is 8 - 3 = 5 years old.
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Sally Four is 5 / 2 = 2.5 years old.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, so Sally Thirty-two is also 2.5 years old.

Therefore, the ages of the birds at the same time are:

* Sally Two: 8 - 3 = 5 years old
* Granny Red: 5 years old
* Sally Four: 2.5 years old
* Sally Thirty-two: 2.5 years old

So, all the birds are the same age (2.5 years old) at the same time."	2

Student loans are at least $300/month, her credit card is at least $200/month, and her personal loan is at least $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay off 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay off in a year?	18000	"Answer only. 
Jessica tries to figure out how to pay off all of her debts each month. Student loans are at least $300/month, her credit card is at least $200/month, and her personal loan is at least $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay off 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay off in a year?

Please show your work.

Answer:

To find out how much Jessica pays off in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12.

Total monthly payments = minimum payments for student loans + minimum payments for credit card + minimum payments for personal loan

Minimum payments for student loans = $300
Minimum payments for credit card = $200
Minimum payments for personal loan = $500

Total monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000

To pay off 50% more than the minimum, Jessica pays an additional 50% of the total monthly payments, which is:

50% of $1,000 = $500

So, Jessica pays a total of $1,500 per month to pay off her debts.

To find out how much she pays off in a year, we multiply the total monthly payments by 12:

$1,500 x 12 = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica pays off $18,000 in a year by paying 50% more than the minimum payments."	50

Billy is pressing and cutting potatoes in preparation for making the first salad for his large family to gather for barbecue.It's a big party, so he has 60 potatoes to finish.The potatoes are the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to press and cut each one.It takes Billy about a minute and a half to press the potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it.How long will it take Billy to finish making the potatoes?

Answer:

To find out how long it will take Billy to finish making the potatoes, we need to find out how long it will take him to press and cut all 60 potatoes.

First, we can find out how long it will take him to press all the potatoes:

60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes (to press all the potatoes)

Next, we can find out how long it will take him to cut all the potatoes:

60 potatoes x 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds (to cut all the potatoes)

So, in total, it will take Billy 90 minutes to press all the potatoes and 300 seconds (or 5 minutes) to cut all the potatoes. Therefore, it will take him a total of 90 + 300 = 390 minutes (or 6.5 hours) to finish making all the potatoes."	6

Answer: 
They spent $25 on lemons.

Explanation:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

In this case, Total Revenue = 20 bottles x $0.50 = $10

Total Cost = 20 bottles x $3 + 20 bottles x $2 = $60

Profit = $10 - $60 = $25

Therefore, they spent $25 on lemons."	25
176	In the competition with 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese, the rest were Chinese.If the number of boys in the Chinese team was 60, how many girls were in the Chinese team?	100	"Answer only. 
In the competition with 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese, the rest were Chinese.If the number of boys in the Chinese team was 60, how many girls were in the Chinese team?

Let X be the number of girls in the Chinese team.

We know that the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, so the number of girls in the Chinese team is 60 - X.

We also know that the total number of Asians is 240, and the number of Japanese is 80.

So, the number of Chinese is 240 - 80 = 160.

Since the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, the number of girls in the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100.

Therefore, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team."	100

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and gives half of the rest to his favorite charity.He gives his daughter $200 to spend on groceries every week and $700 to his wife to cook food and other household items.If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much will he have left over after all the expenses and donations?

Answer: $1,860

Explanation:

Zaid's expenses can be calculated as follows:

Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
Car fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
Charity: Half of $6,000 = $3,000

Total expenses = $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $6,500

Zaid gives his daughter $200 per week, so over the course of a month, he gives her $200 x 4 = $800.

He also gives his wife $700 per month for cooking and other household items.

Total amount given to family members = $800 + $700 = $1,500

So, Zaid's net amount left over after all expenses and donations is:

$6,500 - $1,500 = $1,860"	1860

Rani has ten fingers more than Monic, and 4 fewer than Bo. If Bo has 40 fingers, count the total number of fingers the three of them have together.

Answer: 80 fingers.

Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 fingers.

Therefore, Rani has 10 + 36 = 46 fingers.

Together, Rani, Monic, and Bo have 46 + 40 = 86 fingers."	86

Answer:
Fred would have to deliver 80 red flowers by 11 p.m.

Explanation:
To calculate the number of red flowers that Fred needs to deliver, we can use the information that the white carnations are four times the size of the red flowers. So, if the white carnations are 4 times the size of the red flowers, then the number of red flowers is:

4 x 200 = 800

Since Sandra ordered 200 purple and calla flowers, which are five times the number of white flowers, the number of purple and calla flowers is:

5 x 200 = 1000

Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 800 red flowers and 1000 purple and calla flowers by 11 p.m. to meet Sandra's requirements."	11

I understand that you're looking for a math-based answer, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide a direct answer to your question. However, I can guide you through the process of solving the problem.

To start, let's analyze the given information:

1. The first team consists of four individuals, each running 400 meters in 55 seconds.
2. The second team consists of four individuals, with each runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the total time taken by the second team to complete the race. We know that the first runner will take 60 seconds to complete the 400 meters, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster. So, the second runner will take:

60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds

The third runner will take:

63 seconds + 3 seconds = 66 seconds

And the fourth runner will take:

66 seconds + 3 seconds = 69 seconds

Now, we need to find the total time taken by the second team to complete the race. We can do this by adding the times taken by each runner:

69 seconds + 66 seconds + 63 seconds + 60 seconds = 268 seconds

Finally, we need to compare the total time taken by the two teams to find out how many seconds the fastest team will win the race. In this case, the fastest team (the first team) took 220 seconds (55 seconds x 4 runners) to"	4

Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets to the exhibition.They also spent $4.50 on food, which is less than they spent on tickets.They also went on two separate trips, each costing $33.If they agreed to split the total cost equally, how much did each of them pay?

Answer:

Let x be the amount each friend paid for the tickets.

We know that x + 2x + 3x = 20.25 + 4.50 + 33

Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 58

x = 58/6

x = 9.67

So each friend paid $9.67 for the tickets."	9

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year.Every year he also cuts down 2 trees a year.He started with 50 trees.After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.How many trees are left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year.Every year he also cuts down 2 trees a year.He started with 50 trees.After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.How many trees are left?

Answer: 24 trees.

Explanation:

1. Initially, Tom has 50 trees.
2. Every year, he plants 10 new trees and cuts down 2 old trees, so the total number of trees remains constant.
3. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die (50 x 0.3 = 15 trees die).
4. So, the number of trees left is: 50 - 15 = 35 trees.
5. But, 2 trees are cut down every year, so the number of trees left after 10 years is: 35 - 20 = 24 trees."	24

Sue lives in an interesting neighborhood.One weekend, the neighbors decided to make fun of Sue.On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos in Sue's garden.On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one-third of the birds, painted them white, and placed them in Sue's garden.Then, on Sunday morning, they added 18 more pink and purple flamingos.On Sunday afternoon, how many more red flamingos were out than there were in the week?

The problem is:

Let x be the number of pink flamingos in Sue's garden on Friday morning.

Then, on Saturday morning, the neighbors took one-third of the birds, which is 3x/4, and painted them white.

So, the number of white flamingos on Saturday morning is 3x/4.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added 18 more pink and purple flamingos, so the total number of flamingos on Sunday morning is 3x/4 + 18.

On Sunday afternoon, there were 18 more red flamingos than there were in the week, so the number of red flamingos on Sunday afternoon is 3x/4 + 18 + 18 = 3x/4 + 36.

So, the number of red flamingos on Sunday afternoon is 3x/4 + 36.

Now, can you find out how many more red flamingos were out than there were in the week?"	36

In the town of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. The rest are all children. How many children are there in Soda?

Hint: The number of children is less than the number of men and women combined.

Answer: 4575 children.

Explanation: The total population of Soda is 23786. The number of men is 8417, and the number of women is 9092. Therefore, the total number of adults is 8417 + 9092 = 17519.

2. In January, she collected 3 times as many cards, so she collected 20 x 3 = 60 cards.
3. In February, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in January, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In March, she collected twice as many cards as she had collected in January and February, so she collected 40 + 40 = 80 cards.

Therefore, Elaine has 80 Pokemon cards at the end of March."	80

Explanation:

First, calculate the total amount earned in the year:

$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000

Next, calculate the amount earned before the prize:

$104,000 - $5000 = $99,000

How many slices of cheese did he use?

Answer: 
Carl used 22 slices of cheese in total.

Explanation:

* For each sandwich, Carl used 2 slices of cheese. Since he ate sandwiches for lunch every day this week, he used a total of 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches.
* For his breakfast, Carl spent half as much on eggs as he did on sandwiches. Since he spent $3 on sandwiches, he spent $3 / 2 = $1.50 on eggs. Since he ate breakfast three days a week, he spent a total of $1.50 x 3 = $4.50 on eggs.
* Carl also made a large plate of pasta and cheese for several meals a week. Since he used 8 slices of cheese in it, he used a total of 8 x however many meals he had = 8 x 5 = 40 slices of cheese for his pasta dishes.

Adding up all these amounts, Carl used a total of 14 + 4.5 + 40 = 22 slices of cheese."	22

Answer: 1500 km

Explanation:

Week 1: 5 times a week x 25 km per ride = 125 km per week
Week 2: 2 times a week x 60 km per ride = 120 km per week
Total distance for 4 weeks = 125 km + 120 km + 120 km + 120 km = 485 km

Week 5: 2 times a week x 60 km per ride = 120 km per week
Total distance for 3 weeks = 120 km + 120 km + 120 km = 360 km

Total distance = 485 km + 360 km = 1500 km"	1500

209	Twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups, which cost $6,000 per cup. Calculate the cost per cup.	145	"Answer only. 
Twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups, which cost $6,000 per cup. Calculate the cost per cup.

Answer: $400

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups.
2. Half-dozen cups cost $6,000 per cup.

We can start by calculating the cost of half-dozen cups:

Half-dozen cups = 6 cups x $6,000 per cup = $36,000

Now, let's calculate the cost of twenty half-dozen cups:

Twenty half-dozen cups = 20 x $36,000 = $720,000

The problem states that twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the cost of half-dozen cups, so we can subtract $1,200 from the cost of half-dozen cups to find the cost of twenty half-dozen cups:

$720,000 - $1,200 = $718,800

Finally, we can divide the cost of twenty half-dozen cups by the number of cups to find the cost per cup:

$718,800 ÷ 20 = $35,940 per cup

Therefore, the cost per cup is $35,940."	35940

Sarah wants to buy a new coat and two pairs of shoes. The coat she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah takes care of the neighbor's children four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cuts the grass. If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started raising the kids, how many lawns would she have to cut before she could afford the coat and shoes?

Answer: 
Sarah would have to cut 4 lawns to earn enough money to buy the coat and shoes.

Explanation:

* Sarah has already saved $10, so she has $10 + $20 (from cutting the lawns) = $30, which is enough to buy the coat.
* To buy the two pairs of shoes, Sarah needs $20 + $20 = $40.
* Since Sarah has already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to buy the shoes.
* Therefore, Sarah needs to cut 4 lawns (at $5 each) to earn the $20 she needs to buy the shoes."	20

While at the dollar store, Sloane saw 100 customers come into the store.The next day, she saw 50 more customers than she had seen on the first day.If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did she survey on the third day?

Answer: 350.

Explanation:

Let's say Sloane saw x customers on the first day.

Then, on the second day, she saw 50 more customers than she saw on the first day, so she saw 50 + x customers on the second day.

On the third day, she saw 500 - (50 + x) customers, since there were 500 customers in total and she had already seen 50 + x customers on the second day.

So, we can set up the equation:

500 - (50 + x) = 350

Simplifying the equation:

500 - 50 - x = 350

Solving for x:

450 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 150

So, Sloane saw 150 customers on the first day, 50 + 150 = 200 customers on the second day, and 500 - 200 = 300 customers on the third day."	300

Jerry has two swimming pools, both of which are leaking water at a rate of 4 liters per minute.Four minutes ago, the larger pool still had twice as much water as the smaller pool.The larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.How much water does the smaller pool have?

Let the smaller pool have x liters of water.

Since the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool, the larger pool has 4x liters of water.

Four minutes ago, the larger pool still had twice as much water as the smaller pool, so the larger pool had 2x liters of water and the smaller pool had x liters of water.

The rate at which the larger pool is leaking water is 4 liters per minute, so the larger pool has lost 4x liters of water in the last four minutes.

Therefore, the smaller pool has x + 4x = 5x liters of water.

Since the smaller pool has x liters of water, we can solve for x:

x = 5x / 2

x = 5(5x) / 2

x = 25x / 2

x = 12.5x

Therefore, the smaller pool has 12.5x liters of water."	12

Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay her back with an additional 10% interest. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much money will Janeth have left over?

Answer: $1,625

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the total amount that Janeth will pay over the 12 months:

12 months x $165 per month = $1,980

Next, let's calculate the total amount of interest that Janeth will pay over the 12 months:

12 months x 10% interest = $198

Now, let's subtract the total amount of interest from the total amount that Janeth will pay to find out how much she will have left over:

$1,980 - $198 = $1,782

Therefore, Janeth will have $1,782 left over after paying off the loan."	1782

Four students scored 251 points in a game. Naomi scored 68.Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?

Answer: 251

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 78 points (68 + 10).
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 85 points (68 + 17).
4. The total score of all four students is 251 points.

Now, let's add the scores of all four students:

68 + 78 + 85 + 251 = 251

Since the sum of the scores is equal to the total score of 251 points, we can conclude that:

Jojo scored 251 points."	251

It takes Carmen ten minutes to complete a word puzzle, and five minutes to complete a sudoku puzzle.Last weekend, she solved 3 word puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles.How long has she been playing these games?

Answer: 2 hours and 35 minutes.

Explanation:

Word puzzles take 10 minutes each, so 3 word puzzles would take 3 x 10 = 30 minutes.

Sudoku puzzles take 5 minutes each, so 8 sudoku puzzles would take 8 x 5 = 40 minutes.

In total, Carmen spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games.

To find out how much the company spent on advertising in total over two years, we need to add the amount they spent in the first year to the amount they spent in the second year.

First year:
The company spent $15,000 on advertising.

Second year:
The company spent a third of the amount they spent in the first year, which is:

$15,000 x 1/3 = $5,000

So, the company spent a total of:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000 on advertising over two years."	20000

James is counting Pokemon cards.He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water.If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the probability (based on the nearest whole number) that the randomly selected card will be a type of water?

Please provide step by step solution.

Thank you.

Answer:

Let's first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 types of water and buying 14 types of grass:

Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

After losing 8 types of water:

Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

After buying 14 types of grass:

Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, let's calculate the number of water cards James has:

Number of water cards = 40 - 8 = 32

Probability of randomly selecting a water card = Number of water cards / Total cards

= 32 / 96

= 1/3

So, the probability of randomly selecting a water card is 1/3."	3

Chad ordered a homemade burrito for lunch.The original burrito cost $6.50.He added the meat for $2, the cheese for $1, the sauce for $1, and the sausage for $0.25 each.He chose to add his own food for $3 plus fridge and drink.He has a $5 gift card to use when he goes shopping.How much debt does he have left?

Answer: $1.25

Explanation:

1. Original burrito cost: $6.50
2. Added meat: $2
3. Added cheese: $1
4. Added sauce: $1
5. Added sausage: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total cost: $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.50 = $11.00
6. Chad chose to add his own food for $3, so he paid:
$11.00 - $3 = $8.00
7. He has a $5 gift card to use, so he has:
$8.00 - $5 = $3.00
8. Therefore, he has $3.00 left on his gift card, which is his debt.

Answer: $1.25 (the amount left on his gift card)"	1
228	Callie is working with her mother on a 360-piece puzzle.Callie can typically add 4 pieces per minute.Callie's mother can typically add half as many pieces per minute.How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Answer only. 
Callie is working with her mother on a 360-piece puzzle.Callie can typically add 4 pieces per minute.Callie's mother can typically add half as many pieces per minute.How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?

Answer: 

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 360.
Callie can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can add 360/4 = 90 pieces in 1 hour.
Callie's mother can add half as many pieces per minute, so she can add 360/2 = 180 pieces in 1 hour.
Since Callie's mother can add more pieces per minute than Callie, it will take Callie and her mother together 90 + 180 = 270 minutes to complete the puzzle.
Therefore, it will take them 270/60 = 4.5 hours to complete the puzzle."	4

The number of students in the classroom was 1000.The building had three doors, A, B, and C, which were also used for exits.If after the meeting 30% of the students left the building through the A door, 3/5 of the remaining students left through the B door, and the remaining students left through the C door, this is the number of students who left through the C door.

Answer: 324 students.

Here's the explanation:

Let X be the number of students who left through the C door.

Since 30% of the students left through the A door, the number of students who left through the A door is 30% of 1000, or 300 students.

So, the number of students who remained in the classroom after the meeting is 1000 - 300 = 700.

Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through the B door, the number of students who left through the B door is 3/5 of 700, or 210 students.

Therefore, the number of students who left through the C door is 700 - 210 = 490 students.

So, the answer is 490 students."	490

Mike corresponded with five people.He eventually stopped corresponding with two of them.Each of them sent two letters a week, totaling five pages.He replied in kind.He could write a page every 6 minutes.How many hours a week did he spend writing?

Answer: 2 hours per week.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the given information:

1. Mike corresponded with five people.
2. He eventually stopped corresponding with two of them.
3. Each of the three people he continued to correspond with sent two letters per week, totaling five pages.
4. Mike replied in kind, so he also sent two letters per week.
5. Mike could write a page every 6 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Mike spent writing each week:

1. Total number of pages Mike received = 2 x 3 = 6 pages
2. Total number of pages Mike sent = 2 x 1 = 2 pages
3. Total time Mike spent writing = 6 pages / 6 minutes per page = 1 hour
4. Total time Mike spent writing each week = 1 hour x 3 people = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spent 3 hours per week writing."	3

245	The difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
The difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?

Let X be the number of fish in one aquarium and Y be the number of fish in the other aquarium.

We know that the difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums.

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

X + Y > 2(X + Y)

Simplifying the equation:

2X + 2Y > 2(X + Y)

Comparing the coefficients of X and Y:

2X + 2Y - X - Y > 0

Solving for X and Y:

X = 4, Y = 2

So, there are 4 fish in one aquarium and 2 fish in the other aquarium."	2

The chef bought 4 bags of biscuits.Each bag weighs 50 kg.One kilogram of biscuits costs $1.50.How much did the chef spend?

Answer: The chef spent $60.

Explanation:

The chef bought 4 bags of biscuits, and each bag weighs 50 kg.

So, the total weight of biscuits bought by the chef is 4 x 50 kg = 200 kg.

Since one kilogram of biscuits costs $1.50, the total cost of the biscuits is:

200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on biscuits."	300

Answer:

Let x be the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday.

Since Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday, she ate 4x = 24 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2(24) = 48 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies on Tuesday.

Therefore, Sue ate more calories than her sister by:
