2	Josh decides to try copying a house. He buys it for $80,000 and leaves $50,000 for repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Answer only. 
Josh decides to try copying a house. He buys it for $80,000 and leaves $50,000 for repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

Answer: $100,000.

Explanation: The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh left $50,000 for repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. So, the new value of the house is:

$80,000 + ($50,000 x 150%) = $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and sold it for $155,000, so he made a profit of:

$155,000 - $80,000 = $75,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $75,000."	75000

5	Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. $5 for one window, but only 60% off for each second window. Kyler wants to buy 16 windows. How much will they cost?	64	"Answer only. 
Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. $5 for one window, but only 60% off for each second window. Kyler wants to buy 16 windows. How much will they cost?

Answer: $24.

Explanation:

1 window = $5
2 windows = $5 x 2 = $10
3 windows = $10 x 2 = $20
4 windows = $20 x 2 = $40
5 windows = $40 x 2 = $80
6 windows = $80 x 2 = $160
7 windows = $160 x 2 = $320
8 windows = $320 x 2 = $640
9 windows = $640 x 2 = $1280
10 windows = $1280 x 2 = $2560
11 windows = $2560 x 2 = $5120
12 windows = $5120 x 2 = $10,240
13 windows = $10,240 x 2 = $20,480
14 windows = $20,480 x 2 = $40,960
15 windows = $40,960 x 2 = $81,920
16 windows = $81,920 x 2 = $163,840

Since Kyler only wants to buy 16 windows, he will pay $24 (2 x $12)."	12
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have in common if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have in common if Seattle has 20 sheep?

Answer: Toulouse has 20 sheep, Charleston has 40 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.

Explanation:

Let's say Toulouse has x sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 4x sheep.

We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2x sheep.

We also know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

Now we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 4x + 20

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 60

Solving for x:

x = 20

So, Toulouse has 20 sheep, Charleston has 40 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep."	20
7	Carla is caching a 200 GB file. By default, she can cache 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the cache, Windows Update forces a restart to load, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla must restart to cache from the beginning. What cache is needed to cache the file?	160	"Answer only. 
Carla is caching a 200 GB file. By default, she can cache 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the cache, Windows Update forces a restart to load, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla must restart to cache from the beginning. What cache is needed to cache the file?

A) 2 GB
B) 4 GB
C) 6 GB
D) 8 GB

Answer: C) 6 GB.

Explanation:

The cache size needed to cache the file is calculated as follows:

Cache size = (File size x Cache rate) / (Restart interval x Time to restart)

In this case, the file size is 200 GB, the cache rate is 2 GB/minute (default), the restart interval is 20 minutes (forced by Windows Update), and the time to restart is 20 minutes.

Substituting these values, we get:

Cache size = (200 GB x 2 GB/min) / (20 min x 20 min)
Cache size = 40 GB / 400 min
Cache size = 6 GB

Therefore, the cache size needed to cache the file is 6 GB."	6

10	One new program had 60 outcomes in the first month. In the second month the number of outcomes in the first month dropped three times, but in the third month it decreased by 30%. What was the total outcome of the program in three months?	366	"Answer only. 
One new program had 60 outcomes in the first month. In the second month the number of outcomes in the first month dropped three times, but in the third month it decreased by 30%. What was the total outcome of the program in three months?

Answer: 300

Explanation:

In the first month, the program had 60 outcomes.

In the second month, the number of outcomes in the first month dropped three times, which means it decreased by a factor of 3. So, the number of outcomes in the second month would be:

60 x 3 = 180

In the third month, the number of outcomes in the second month decreased by 30%. So, the number of outcomes in the third month would be:

180 x 0.7 = 126

Therefore, the total number of outcomes in the program over three months is:

60 + 180 + 126 = 300"	300

12	Carlos has an apple tree. It costs $90 to plant the tree. If he grows 7 apples a year, he can sell them for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years does it take before he starts making money from the apple tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos has an apple tree. It costs $90 to plant the tree. If he grows 7 apples a year, he can sell them for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years does it take before he starts making money from the apple tree?

Answer: 4 years.

Explanation:

Cost of planting the tree: $90
Yearly maintenance cost: $3

Number of apples produced per year: 7
Price per apple: $1.5

Total revenue per year: 7 x $1.5 = $10.50

Total cost per year: $90 + $3 = $93

Break-even point (when revenue equals cost): $10.50 = $93

Therefore, it takes 4 years for Carlos to start making money from the apple tree:

4 years = $93 / $10.50 = 8.9 years

So, Carlos will start making money from the apple tree in the 5th year."	5

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz, and the remainder in hip-hop.	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance class of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz, and the remainder in hip-hop.
If 35 students are enrolled in modern dance and jazz combined, what is the number of students enrolled in hip-hop?

Answer: 15 students.

Explanation:
Let X be the number of students enrolled in hip-hop.
Since 20% of the class is enrolled in modern dance, 20% of 20 students is 4 students.
Since 25% of the class is enrolled in jazz, 25% of 20 students is 5 students.
So, the total number of students enrolled in modern dance and jazz is 4 + 5 = 9 students.
Since 35 students are enrolled in modern dance and jazz combined, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop is 35 - 9 = 15 students."	15

A trader needs to choose between two buying plans: $5,000 worth of goods or $8,000 worth of electronics.His financial advisor predicts that the price of electronics will rise by 2.5% in the same month.If the trader chooses to make a profit at the end of the month, how much profit will it make?

Answer:

If the trader chooses to buy $8,000 worth of electronics, the profit at the end of the month will be:

Profit = (8,000 x 1.025) - 8,000
= 8,000 x 1.025 - 8,000
= 8,000 x 1.025
= 8,200

So, the profit will be $200.

If the trader chooses to buy $5,000 worth of goods, the profit at the end of the month will be:

Profit = (5,000 x 1.025) - 5,000
= 5,000 x 1.025 - 5,000
= 5,000 x 1.025
= 5,125

So, the profit will be $125."	125

20	I have 10 liters of vodka which is two thirds water, I would like to add 15 liters of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But if I pour one liter of vodka, how much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of vodka which is two thirds water, I would like to add 15 liters of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But if I pour one liter of vodka, how much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Please help me with this question.

Thank you!

Answer:

To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of vodka, we need to use the concept of proportion. Let's say that the amount of water in 1 liter of vodka is x.

Since the vodka is two thirds water, we know that:

2/3 of 10 liters = x liters

Simplifying, we get:

6 liters = x liters

Now, we know that the pineapple juice is three fifths water, so:

3/5 of 15 liters = x liters

Simplifying, we get:

9 liters = x liters

Now we can set up a system of linear equations using these two equations:

6 liters = x liters
9 liters = x liters

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7.5 liters

So, there are 7.5 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of vodka."	24

30	The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio 7:11. If their combined present age is 162 years, Allen's life expectancy is 10 years.	109	"Answer only. 
The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio 7:11. If their combined present age is 162 years, Allen's life expectancy is 10 years.

What is Darrell's life expectancy?

Please show your steps.

Answer:

Let's assume that Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.

We know that their combined age is 162 years, so we can write:

7x + 11x = 162

Simplifying the equation:

18x = 162

Dividing both sides by 18:

x = 9

So Darrell's age is 7x = 63 years.

Allen's age is 11x = 79 years.

Allen's life expectancy is 10 years, so he will live for:

79 + 10 = 89 years

Therefore, Darrell's life expectancy is:

63 + 10 = 73 years."	73

Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another 20 says more than half of the original. A third says 25% more than the original. What is their average estimate?

Answer: 

The average estimate is 160.

Explanation:

Let's call the original number of jelly beans x.

The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans, so the second friend's estimate is x + 20.

The third friend says there are 25% more than the original, so their estimate is x + (25/100)x = x + 25.

The average of these three estimates is:

(80 + (x + 20) + (x + 25)) / 3

Simplifying, we get:

(80 + x + 20 + x + 25) / 3

= (200 + 3x) / 3

= 66 + 3x

The average estimate is 66 + 3x."	3

33	The Grech has 110 coins. The silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin. How many gold coins does Grech have?	70	"Answer only. 
The Grech has 110 coins. The silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin. How many gold coins does Grech have?

Let x be the number of gold coins.

The total value of the coins is 110x + 30x = 140x.

The silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin, so the value of the silver coin is 30x.

The total value of the coins is equal to the value of the silver coin plus the value of the gold coins, so we can set up the equation:

140x = 30x + x

Solve for x to find out how many gold coins Grech has."	30

Let Raymond have 40 pearls.

Aaron has 5 more pearls than half of Raymond's pearls,

So, Aaron has 5 more pearls than 20 pearls (half of 40)

Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 pearls.

Siobhan has 2 fewer pearls than Aaron,

So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 pearls."	23

2. Each set of Legos costs $15.
3. John sells all his Legos.
4. He uses the money to buy video games.
5. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.
6. He has $5 left after buying the video games.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many Legos John still has in his collection.

First, we can calculate how much money John made from selling his Legos:

13 sets x $15 per set = $195

Next, we can calculate how much money John spent on video games:

8 video games x $20 per game = $160

Finally, we can subtract the amount John spent on video games from the amount he made from selling his Legos to find out how much money he has left:

$195 - $160 = $35

So, John has $35 left after buying the video games. Since he has $5 left, we can subtract that from the $35 to find out how many Legos he still has:

$35 - $5 = $30

Therefore, John still has 30 sets of Legos in his collection."	30
38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. The first day he runs for 3 hours and a half and the other two days. How fast does he run?	10	"Answer only. 
John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. The first day he runs for 3 hours and a half and the other two days. How fast does he run?

Answer:  John runs at a pace of 9 minutes per mile.

Explanation:

To find out how fast John runs, we need to know how far he runs each day and how long he runs for. Let's say he runs for 3 hours and a half on the first day, and for 2 hours on the other two days.

Total distance = 3 hours x 6 miles/hour + 2 hours x 6 miles/hour
Total distance = 18 miles + 12 miles
Total distance = 30 miles

Since John runs for 3 days, he runs a total of 30 miles x 3 = 90 miles per week.

Now, we know that John runs for 3 hours and a half on the first day, so he runs for 3.5 hours. We can calculate his pace as follows:

Pace = distance / time
Pace = 90 miles / 3.5 hours
Pace = 25.7 miles per hour

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the pace to minutes per mile as follows:

Pace (minutes per mile) = 25.7 miles per hour x 60 minutes/hour
Pace (minutes per mile) = 9 minutes per mile

Therefore, John runs at a pace of 9 minutes per mile."	9
39	If she could run three miles an hour, how many miles would she run in an hour if she ran a third of the way and walked two thirds of the way?	18	"Answer only. 
If she could run three miles an hour, how many miles would she run in an hour if she ran a third of the way and walked two thirds of the way?

A) 2 miles
B) 3 miles
C) 4 miles
D) 6 miles

Answer: C) 4 miles

Explanation:
If she ran a third of the way, she ran for 1/3 of an hour, which is 20 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

If she walked two thirds of the way, she walked for 2/3 of an hour, which is 40 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

In total, she ran for 20 minutes and walked for 40 minutes, so she spent 60 minutes running and walking.

Since she ran three miles per hour, she ran 3 miles in 20 minutes (since there are 1200 feet in a mile and 5280 feet in 20 minutes).

Therefore, she ran 3 miles in 20 minutes, and since she walked for 40 minutes, she walked for 4 miles (since there are 1200 feet in a mile and 5280 feet in 40 minutes).

So, in total, she ran 3 miles and walked 4 miles, for a total of 7 miles in one hour.

The correct answer is C) 4 miles."	4

41	The giant Perge, perched on the summit of Mount Farbo, blew flames at anything within 1,000 feet. The golden spear, the only weapon known to have stolen the dragon, could be fired at a distance of 400 feet, where the fire could reach the dragon. But with the sapphire in its hand, the spear was three times stronger than without the gem. If so, how far away from the dragon's fire could Pauline stand and strike the golden spear again?	200	"Answer only. 
The giant Perge, perched on the summit of Mount Farbo, blew flames at anything within 1,000 feet. The golden spear, the only weapon known to have stolen the dragon, could be fired at a distance of 400 feet, where the fire could reach the dragon. But with the sapphire in its hand, the spear was three times stronger than without the gem. If so, how far away from the dragon's fire could Pauline stand and strike the golden spear again?

(Note: I'm not sure if this is the correct way to ask the question, but I'll try my best to provide the answer.)

To determine how far away from the dragon's fire Pauline could stand and strike the golden spear, we need to consider the strength of the dragon's fire and the range of the spear.

The dragon's fire is powerful enough to engulf anything within 1,000 feet, so we need to ensure that Pauline is at a safe distance from the dragon's fire. The golden spear, with the sapphire in its hand, can be fired at a distance of 400 feet, which means that Pauline could stand at a distance of 400 feet from the dragon and still strike the spear.

However, we also need to consider the strength of the dragon's fire. If the dragon's fire is too powerful, even at a distance of 400 feet, Pauline may not be able to withstand the heat and flames. Therefore, we need to find the maximum distance at which Pauline could stand and still strike the golden spear without being affected by the dragon's fire.

To do this, we need to calculate the range of the dragon's fire and compare it to the range of the golden spear. Let's assume that the dragon's fire has a range of 1,000 feet, as stated in the problem. This means that anything within 1,000 feet of the dragon would be engulfed in flames.

Now, let's calculate the range of the golden spear. With the sapphire in its hand, the spear can be fired at a distance of 4"	4

By the end of the evening, after the guests had eaten their pies, there were 14 pies left. How many pies did each guest receive?

Answer: 14 pies

Explanation:

Grandma Johnson cut each apple into 8 pies, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pies in total.

Since there were 14 pies left at the end of the evening, each guest received 14 / 40 = 1/2 of a pie."	2

According to the dietary information, one pound of potato chips has 250 calories per meal. If one pound of potato chips has 5, how many grams would you eat if you had 2,000 calories per day and had eaten 1,800 calories before?

Answer: 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left.

200 calories / 250 calories per pound = 0.8 pounds.

Charlie wants to sell his cheese. He can make a total of 10 cheeses for each cheese. He sells his cheese and tomatoes for $10.00 a week. If he sells his cheese for $2.00 each, what is the net profit if he makes 20 cheeses?

Answer: $20.00

Explanation:

Total revenue = 20 cheeses x $2.00 per cheese = $40.00

Total cost = 20 cheeses x $1.00 per cheese = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00"	20

If there were 23 letters of remembrance left, how many letters of remembrance were in the package she bought?

Answer: 20

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how many letters of remembrance Candice put on each cup of coffee:

220 cups of coffee x 1 letter of remembrance per cup = 220 letters of remembrance

Now, let's find out how many letters of remembrance were left:

23 letters of remembrance left - 220 letters of remembrance used = 20 letters of remembrance left

Therefore, there were 20 letters of remembrance in the package Candice bought."	20
47	John buys red carbide twice as much as blue carbide. The red carbide costs 50% more than the blue carbide. He spent $200 on the blue carbide which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the blue carbide?	800	"Answer only. 
John buys red carbide twice as much as blue carbide. The red carbide costs 50% more than the blue carbide. He spent $200 on the blue carbide which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the blue carbide?

Let the cost of the blue carbide be x.

Since John buys red carbide twice as much as blue carbide, he buys 2x red carbide.

The cost of 2x red carbide = 2x(40) = 80x.

Since the red carbide costs 50% more than the blue carbide, the cost of 2x red carbide is 50% more than the cost of x blue carbide.

So, the cost of 2x red carbide = 1.5x(40) = 60x.

John spends $200 on the blue carbide, so the cost of the blue carbide is:

x = 200/40 = 5

Therefore, John spends $5 on the blue carbide."	5

Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. Each floor consists of 8 units, occupying 3/4 of the building. How many of the total units are unoccupied?

Answer: 8

Explanation:
There are 15 floors in the building, and each floor has 8 units, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total.
Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of unoccupied units can be found by subtracting 3/4 of 120 from 120:
120 - (3/4 x 120) = 120 - 90 = 30
Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building."	30

Answer: Lloyd makes 1,764 eggs per week.

Explanation:

To find out how many eggs Lloyd makes in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs she produces per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

The Tom can travel 10 miles per hour. It sails from 1 to 4 PM. Then it turns back at 6 mph. How long does it take to return?

Answer: 3 hours.

Explanation:

To find the time it takes to return, we need to divide the distance traveled by the speed:

Distance = 10 miles/hour x 4 hours = 40 miles

Time to return = Distance / Speed
= 40 miles / 6 mph
= 6.67 hours

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, the time to return is 3 hours."	3

A mechanic charges different rates for each truck wheel and truck repair. For each truck wheel repaired, the mechanic charges $60 and for each truck wheel repaired, the mechanic charges $40. In each case, the mechanic repairs 6 truck wheels and 4 truck wheels. On Fridays, the mechanic does not repair 12 truck wheels or any truck wheels. On the day of high earnings, how much more did the mechanic earn?

Let's denote the number of truck wheels repaired on a regular day as x.

On a regular day, the mechanic earns:

6x + 4x = 10x

On a Friday, the mechanic does not repair any truck wheels, so the earnings are 0.

On the day of high earnings, the mechanic repairs 6 truck wheels and 4 truck wheels, so the earnings are:

6(6) + 4(4) = 36 + 16 = 52

The mechanic earns 52 on the day of high earnings, which is 52 more than the regular day earnings of 10x."	10

After the additional charge, what was the final price of the food that Stephen ordered?

Answer: $47.00.

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the final total of the grocery order before applying the transportation fee and tip:

$40.00 (final payment) x 1.25 (25% charge) = $50.00

Now, let's add the transportation fee:

$50.00 (final total) + $3.00 (transportation fee) = $53.00

Finally, let's add the tip:

$53.00 (final total) + $4.00 (tip) = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of the food that Stephen ordered is $57.00."	57

If Marcie works for a company for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she is entitled to an annual pension of 5%. If she retires after 30 years, what will her retirement age be?

Please show your work and explain your reasoning.

Answer: 65 years old.

Explanation:
To determine Marcie's retirement age, we need to calculate her total years of service with the company. She has worked for the company for 40 years, so her total years of service are:

40 years x 30 years (number of years she worked) = 1200 months

Now, we need to calculate her pension amount based on her total years of service. Since she is entitled to an annual pension of 5% after 20 years of service, we need to calculate her pension amount for the first 20 years of her service.

1200 months x $50,000 (annual pension) x 5% (pension increase after 20 years) = $600,000

Since Marcie has worked for the company for 30 years, she has received a total pension of:

$600,000 x 30 years = $18,000,000

Now, we need to calculate her retirement age based on her total pension amount. According to the pension plan, Marcie's retirement age is:

$18,000,000 / $50,000 (annual pension) = 65 years old

Therefore, Marcie's retirement age is 65 years old."	65

If the broadcaster charged her less than 10% of her first-half salary for the first half of the year and then charged her less than 10% of her second-half salary for the second half of the year, the total salary she paid for her broadcasting services at the end of the year would be taxed.	1596	"Answer only. 
Alena paid $140 a month for her broadcasting services. If the broadcaster charged her less than 10% of her first-half salary for the first half of the year and then charged her less than 10% of her second-half salary for the second half of the year, the total salary she paid for her broadcasting services at the end of the year would be taxed.

Question: What is Alena's total salary for the year?

Answer: Alena's total salary for the year is $28,000.

Explanation:

We know that Alena paid $140 per month for her broadcasting services, which is equivalent to $1,680 per year.

Since the broadcaster charged her less than 10% of her first-half salary for the first half of the year, we can calculate her first-half salary as follows:

First-half salary = $1,680 x 0.10 = $168

So, Alena paid $168 for her broadcasting services in the first half of the year.

Similarly, since the broadcaster charged her less than 10% of her second-half salary for the second half of the year, we can calculate her second-half salary as follows:

Second-half salary = $1,680 x 0.10 = $168

So, Alena paid $168 for her broadcasting services in the second half of the year.

Therefore, Alena's total salary for the year is:

Total salary = $168 + $168 = $336

Since Alena paid $140 per month for her broadcasting services, her total salary for the year is $336."	336

Sophia, who is considering a road trip, wants to know how far she can go with one tank of gas. After the last 100 miles, she still needs to fill up her tank with 4 gallons of gas. According to the manufacturer's contract, her car has 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia travel with one tank of gas?

Answer:

Sophia can travel 100 miles + (4 gallons / 12 gallons) = 100 miles + 0.333 x 12 = 100 miles + 4 = 104 miles.

Explanation:

To find out how far Sophia can travel with one tank of gas, we need to first calculate how much gas she has left after driving for 100 miles. We know that she has 12 gallons of gas and she needs 4 gallons to drive the last 100 miles, so she has:

12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons

Since her car uses 1 gallon of gas every 100 miles, she can travel:

8 gallons / 100 miles = 80 miles

So, Sophia can travel 100 miles + 80 miles = 180 miles with one tank of gas. However, since she needs to fill up her tank with 4 gallons of gas after driving for 100 miles, she can only travel 104 miles with one tank of gas."	104

1. There are twice as many boys as girls.
2. There are 60 girls for every teacher.
3. There are 5 students for every teacher.

We can start by using the first piece of information to find out how many boys there are. If there are twice as many boys as girls, then for every 60 girls, there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys.

Now, we know that there are 60 girls for every teacher, so there are 60 girls for every teacher. And, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher, so there are 5 + 60 = 65 students for every teacher.

Finally, we can use the fact that there are 120 boys for every teacher to find out how many teachers there are. There are 120/65 = 30 teachers.

So, there are 30 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."	30
69	Belle starts with a certain amount of money. After that, for 8 weeks, she earns $5 per week. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Belle start with?	60	"Answer only. 
Belle starts with a certain amount of money. After that, for 8 weeks, she earns $5 per week. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Belle start with?

Answer: $85.

Explanation:

Belle starts with x amount of money.

For 8 weeks, she earns $5 per week, so she earns a total of 8 x $5 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $40 + x, so the equation is:

x + $40 = $100

Solving for x, we get:

x = $85

Therefore, Belle started with $85."	85

73	Sheila bought five mobile phones for $150 each for 3 months. Each unit is charged 2% interest. How much does Sheila pay per month for 3 months?	255	"Answer only. 
Sheila bought five mobile phones for $150 each for 3 months. Each unit is charged 2% interest. How much does Sheila pay per month for 3 months?

Answer: Sheila pays $150 x 2% = $3 per month for 3 months.

Explanation:

To calculate the monthly interest, we need to divide the interest rate by 12.

2% ÷ 12 = 0.02

Now, we can calculate the monthly interest:

$150 x 0.02 = $3

So, Sheila pays $3 per month for 3 months."	3

Luke is spending time building a sand tower on the shore, and he eventually figures out that each level of the sand tower is half a square foot on the lower level. If he built a 4-story sand tower instead of a 16-square-foot top level, what is the average square foot per level?

Please show your work.

Answer:

To find the average square foot per level, we need to divide the total square footage of the tower by the number of levels.

First, let's find the total square footage of the tower:

Each level is half a square foot on the lower level, so the total square footage of the tower is:

4 levels x 0.5 square feet/level = 2 square feet

Now, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average square foot per level:

2 square feet / 4 levels = 0.5 square feet/level

Therefore, the average square foot per level of the sand tower is 0.5 square feet."	0

Cecilia bought a new cat litter. According to her veterinarian, she will need to feed 1 litter of cat food per day for the first 180 days. After that, she will need to feed 2 litter of cat food per day for the rest of her life. If a litter of cat food contains 110 litter of cat food, how many litter of cat food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Answer: Cecilia will use 190 litter of cat food in the first year.

Explanation:

1 litter of cat food per day x 180 days = 180 litter of cat food
2 litter of cat food per day x 365 days (rest of life) = 780 litter of cat food

Total litter of cat food used in the first year = 180 + 780 = 960 litter of cat food"	960

80	Two girls each received one-sixth of a pint [24 L]; then one young man received one pint [6 L]; how many pints of water remained?	10	"Answer only. 
Two girls each received one-sixth of a pint [24 L]; then one young man received one pint [6 L]; how many pints of water remained?

Answer: 18 L.

Explanation:

Let X be the amount of water that the two girls received.

Since each girl received one-sixth of a pint, X = 24/6 = 4 L.

Now, let Y be the amount of water that the young man received.

Since the young man received one pint, Y = 6 L.

So, the total amount of water received by the three individuals is:

X + Y = 4 + 6 = 10 L.

Since the total amount of water received is 24 L, we can set up the equation:

10 = 24.

Solving for X, we get:

X = 18 L.

Therefore, there are 18 L of water remaining."	18

84	One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?	15	"Answer only. 
One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?

Answer: 16 games.

Explanation:

Let's say the team lost x games.

Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won x + 8 games.

The total number of games they played is 22.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games and won 15 games (8 more than they lost)."	8

The second time it goes off, he rings three times more than the first time. The third time it rings half the second time. In total, how many times did the alarm clock ring?

Answer:

The first time the alarm clock rings, it rings four times.
The second time the alarm clock rings, it rings three times more than the first time, so it rings 3 x 4 = 12 times.
The third time the alarm clock rings, it rings half the second time, so it rings 12 / 2 = 6 times.

In total, the alarm clock rings 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times."	22

A Christian who is planning a birthday party, needs a gift of 0.75 for each guest, because 1/4 of the participants will be absent. She invited 16 friends. Each one needs a gift of $2. How much?

I need help with this problem.

Answer:

I'm happy to help! To find the total cost of the gifts, we need to first find the number of guests who will be present. You mentioned that 1/4 of the participants will be absent, so we need to subtract 1/4 of 16 (the number of invited guests) from 16 to find the number of present guests.

16 - (1/4) \* 16 = 16 - 4 = 12

So, there will be 12 present guests.

Since each guest needs a gift of $2, the total cost of the gifts is:

12 \* 2 = 24

Therefore, the total cost of the gifts is $24."	24

Jan has three times as many owls as Marcia. Marcia has two more owls than Cindy. If Cindy has four owls, how many owls do the three of them have in total?

Answer: 

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. Jan has three times as many owls as Marcia.
2. Marcia has two more owls than Cindy.
3. Cindy has four owls.

We can start by finding out how many owls Jan has:

Jan has three times as many owls as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 2 = 6 owls.

Now, we know that Marcia has two more owls than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 owls (2 more than Cindy's 4 owls).

Adding up all the owls, we get:

6 + 4 + 4 = 14

So, the three of them have a total of 14 owls."	14

Lin used to run the 400 meters two seconds faster than Gerald in the 400 meters race, but Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lin ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how fast would Gerald, with a better diet, run the 400 meters?

Let's assume that Lin's time without a better diet is x seconds.

We know that Lin ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, so:

x + 2 = 38

We also know that Gerald improved his speed by 10 percent, so:

Gerald's time = x + 10% of x

We can find 10% of x by multiplying x by 0.1:

10% of x = 0.1x

Now we can substitute x + 2 = 38 and x + 0.1x = 38 into the equation:

x + 2 + 0.1x = 38

Combine like terms:

1.1x + 2 = 38

Subtract 2 from both sides:

1.1x = 36

Divide both sides by 1.1:

x = 32.73

So, Lin ran the 400 meters in 32.73 seconds without a better diet.

To find out how fast Gerald would run the 400 meters with a better diet, we can use the equation:

Gerald's time = x + 10% of x

Substitute x = 32.73:

Gerald's time = 32.73 + 10% of 32.73

10% of 32.73 = 0.1(32.73) = 3.273

Gerald's time = 32.73 + 3.273

Gerald's time = 36.00

Therefore, Gerald, with a better diet, would run the "	36

95	Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in espionage. How many girls are not in espionage?	40	"Answer only. 
Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in espionage. How many girls are not in espionage?

Answer: 40.

Explanation:

Let's first find the total number of students who are not in espionage. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys, and 2/3 of the students are girls. To find the total number of students who are not in espionage, we can multiply the number of boys by the number of girls:

2/5 x 2/3 = 2/15

There are 15 students who are not in espionage.

Now, we know that 2/3 of the students are girls, so we can find the number of girls who are not in espionage by dividing 15 by 2/3:

15 / 2/3 = 40

There are 40 girls who are not in espionage."	40

Harry slept 9 hours a night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. How many hours did Harry sleep more than James?

Please help me solve this problem. I'm having trouble figuring out how to approach it.

Thank you!

Answer:

Harry slept for 9 hours, and James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours.

To find out how many hours James slept, we can multiply 9 hours by 2/3:

9 hours x 2/3 = 6 hours

So James slept for 6 hours.

To find out how many hours Harry slept more than James, we can subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 hours more than James."	3

Mary is an avid gardener. She has recently acquired 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. Previously she had 2 potted plants in each of the 40 windows of her large country house. Filled with generosity, she decides to give one potted plant from each corner of the garden to friends and family.

How many potted plants will Mary have left after giving them away?

Please provide a step-by-step solution.

Thank you.

Answer:

After giving away one potted plant from each corner of the garden, Mary will have 18 - 4 = 14 potted plants left.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Mary had 2 potted plants in each of the 40 windows of her large country house, so she had a total of 40 x 2 = 80 potted plants.
2. She decides to give one potted plant from each corner of the garden to friends and family, so she gives away 4 potted plants (one from each corner).
3. Now, Mary has 80 - 4 = 76 potted plants left.

Therefore, Mary will have 14 potted plants left after giving them away."	14

Frank watches TV every night after he finishes his homework. On Monday and Tuesday nights, he watches his favorite one-hour program. On Tuesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. On Fridays, he watches two one-hour episodes because he can get up for the weekend. In total, he watches 7 hours of TV, so how many 30-minute episodes does he watch on Wednesdays?

Answer: 2.

Explanation:

Frank watches TV for 7 hours in total.

He watches his favorite one-hour program on Monday and Tuesday nights, so he watches 2 hours on each of those nights.

On Tuesdays, he also watches a few 30-minute episodes, so he watches 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour of 30-minute episodes.

On Thursdays, he watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show, so he watches 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.

On Fridays, he watches two one-hour episodes, so he watches 2 hours.

To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watches on Wednesdays, we need to subtract the total amount of time he watches on other days from the total amount of time he watches:

7 hours - (2 hours + 1 hour + 1.5 hours + 2 hours) = 7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour

So, Frank watches 1 hour of 30-minute episodes on Wednesdays."	30

A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. An app company is offering a cash back of $20.00 per gallon if you fill the station with gas. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much gas will they have with them, after cash back?

I have no idea how to do this problem. Please help!

Answer:

If someone buys 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon, they will pay $30.00.
If they receive $20.00 cash back, they will have $30.00 - $20.00 = $10.00 worth of gas left.

So, after cash back, they will have 10 gallons of gas, which is the original amount they bought."	10

111	The boat took two gallons of water for each man who sailed ten miles to shore. It took sixteen seconds to sail, and the distance was sixty - four miles. By the time Julius got to shore, the boat was full.	16	"Answer only. 
The boat took two gallons of water for each man who sailed ten miles to shore. It took sixteen seconds to sail, and the distance was sixty - four miles. By the time Julius got to shore, the boat was full.

How many men could the boat hold?

Answer: 
The boat could hold 4 men.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. The boat took two gallons of water for each man who sailed ten miles to shore.
2. It took sixteen seconds to sail, and the distance was sixty - four miles.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many men the boat could hold.

We know that the boat took two gallons of water for each man, so if we divide the distance by the amount of water used per man, we can find out how many men the boat could hold.

Sixty - four miles / two gallons per man = ?

We can simplify this calculation by multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

64 miles x 2 = 128 gallons

Now, we can divide the total number of gallons by the amount of water used per man to find out how many men the boat could hold:

128 gallons / 2 gallons per man = 64 men

So, the boat could hold 64 men.

Therefore, the answer is 64 men."	64
112	If each class has four teachers, then each teacher has two teachers. If each class has three teachers, then each teacher has four teachers.	24	"Answer only. 
If each class has four teachers, then each teacher has two teachers. If each class has three teachers, then each teacher has four teachers.

This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that requires you to think outside the box. The answer is not based on the information provided directly, but rather on the pattern that emerges when you think about the problem in a different way.

Here's the solution:

If each class has four teachers, then each teacher has two teachers (since there are two teachers for each class). This means that each teacher has two other teachers.

On the other hand, if each class has three teachers, then each teacher has four teachers (since there are four teachers for each class). This means that each teacher has four other teachers.

So, in both cases, each teacher has two or four other teachers, depending on the number of teachers in each class."	-1

The number of pictures that the British phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds that Jamal photographed at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, how many seconds would Jamal's photos at the zoo take?	6	"Answer only. 
Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many pictures as the British phone. The number of pictures that the British phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds that Jamal photographed at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, how many seconds would Jamal's photos at the zoo take?

Answer: 18000 seconds

Explanation:
Let the number of pictures that the British phone can hold be x.
Since the British phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds Jamal photographed, the number of pictures Jamal photographed is 50x/6 = 50/6 = 8 birds.

So, the number of pictures that Jamal's phone can hold is 6x = 6(8) = 48 birds.

Therefore, the number of seconds that Jamal's photos at the zoo would take is 48 x 1800 = 18000 seconds."	18000

She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left over, each of which she paid her $10 for. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each of which she bought for $16 each. How much profit would she make if she sold them all?	90	"Answer only. 
Sasha, after buying some wood, realizes that the price of the wood has gone up by 50% in the last few months. She decides to sell because she has left over. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left over, each of which she paid her $10 for. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each of which she bought for $16 each. How much profit would she make if she sold them all?

Answer:

To find out how much profit Sasha would make if she sold all of the wood, we first need to find out how much each piece of wood is worth now, after the price increase.

The 2 x 4 x 10 boards were bought for $10 each, so after the price increase, they are now worth $10 x 1.5 = $15 each.

The 4 x 4 x 10 boards were bought for $16 each, so after the price increase, they are now worth $16 x 1.5 = $24 each.

Next, we need to find out how much all of the wood is worth in total:

10 x $15 = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards)
5 x $24 = $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards)

Total value of all the wood: $150 + $120 = $270

Sasha paid $10 x 15 = $150 for all of the wood, so if she sold it all for the new price, she would make a profit of:

$270 - $150 = $120

Therefore, Sasha would make a profit of $120 if she sold all of the wood."	120

Adrienne's total salary was 30 percent more than Leah's. After four years, his salary had increased, which was 40 percent more than what he had been earning four years earlier. If Adrienne and Leah's salary had increased at the same time, and Adrienne had earned $40,000 four years earlier, what would their total salary have been four years later?

Answer: $64,000.

Explanation:

Adrienne's salary four years earlier was $40,000.

Adrienne's total salary was 30% more than Leah's salary.

So, Leah's salary four years earlier was $40,000 x 0.7 = $28,000.

Adrienne's salary four years later was 30% more than his salary four years earlier, which is:

$40,000 x 1.3 = $52,000.

Leah's salary four years later was 40% more than her salary four years earlier, which is:

$28,000 x 1.4 = $39,200.

Therefore, Adrienne's total salary four years later is $52,000, and Leah's total salary four years later is $39,200."	39200

Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruit. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 peaches, while Kael brought twice the number of apples and half the number of peaches than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?

Answer:

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 peaches, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples.

Kael also brought half the number of peaches as Morisette, so he brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 peaches.

In total, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits."	27

A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

I need help with this question because I am not sure how to calculate the profit. Please help me understand how to solve this problem.

Thank you!

Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to know the total amount of time doctors spend with patients and the total amount of money patients pay.

Let's start by calculating the total time doctors spend with patients:

500 patients x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money patients pay:

12,000 minutes x $200 per hour = $2,400,000

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total amount of money patients pay - Total amount of money doctors charge

Profit = $2,400,000 - $150 x 500 patients = $2,400,000 - $75,000 = $2,325,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $2,325,000 from these visits."	2325000

The zookeeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the monkeys from the local farm for 2 months. If a thief needs 200 monkeys, a gorilla needs 400 monkeys, and a baboon needs 100 monkeys per month, how many monkeys should he order to stay for 2 months?

Answer: 400 monkeys.

Explanation:
The zookeeper needs to order enough monkeys to meet the demands of all the animals in the zoo. Since a gorilla needs 400 monkeys per month, and there are two months, the zookeeper needs to order 400 x 2 = 800 monkeys. Since a baboon needs 100 monkeys per month, and there are two months, the zookeeper needs to order 100 x 2 = 200 monkeys. Therefore, the total number of monkeys the zookeeper should order is 800 + 200 = 1000 monkeys."	1000

Raphael went out to buy some school supplies. He bought a set of 4 for $1.5, a set of 2 for $4, and a set of paper towels for $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?

Answer: Raphael spent $25 on everything.

To solve this problem, we need to add the cost of each item that Raphael bought:

4 x $1.5 = $6
2 x $4 = $8
$20

Adding these amounts gives us:

$6 + $8 + $20 = $25

So, Raphael spent $25 on everything."	25

A water tank is 17 meters deep on Monday.On Tuesday the tank had 7 feet more water.On Tuesday the water is two-thirds as deep as it was on Tuesday.What is the water depth of the tank on Wednesday?

Answer:

Let the depth of water in the tank on Monday be x meters.

According to the problem, on Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water, so the depth of water on Tuesday is:

x + 7

On Tuesday, the water is two-thirds as deep as it was on Monday, so we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = 2/3x

Solving for x, we get:

x + 7 = 2/3x

x = 12 meters

So, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is 12 meters."	12

162	If a coin is worth $20 and its value increases by 20% in two months, how much would a coin be worth after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a coin is worth $20 and its value increases by 20% in two months, how much would a coin be worth after 36 months?

Answer:

To find out how much the coin is worth after 36 months, we need to find out how much it is worth after each of the two 6-month periods that make up the 36 months.

After the first 6 months, the coin is worth 20% more than it was worth at the beginning of the period, so it is worth:

20 x 1.20 = 24

So, after the first 6 months, the coin is worth $24.

After the second 6 months, the coin is worth 20% more than it was worth at the beginning of the period, so it is worth:

24 x 1.20 = 28.80

So, after 36 months, the coin is worth $28.80."	28

Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her own tax filing or hire an accountant. If she does her own tax filing, she will be able to work freelance for 3 hours less, losing $35 an hour. The accountant will only be paid $90. If she hires an accountant, how much extra money will she have?

I'm happy to help you with this question! To find out how much extra money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to subtract the amount she would lose by doing her own tax filing from the cost of hiring an accountant.

Let's start by calculating the amount she would lose by doing her own tax filing:

3 hours x $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract this amount from the cost of hiring an accountant:

$90 - $105 = -$15

So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $15 less than if she did her own tax filing.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."	15

Billie barbecues the skin of the rabbit and has a few to prepare to make the rabbit salad for his large family gathering. Because of its size, he has 60 rabbits to pass through. Since the rabbits are roughly the same size, each takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut. Billie takes about a minute and a half to peel a rabbit, but for some it only takes about 5 seconds. How long does it take to finish making the rabbit?

Answer:

To find out how long it takes to finish making the rabbit salad, we need to calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut all 60 rabbits.

Let's start by finding out how long it takes to peel one rabbit:

Billie takes about a minute and a half to peel a rabbit, so:

1 rabbit = 1.5 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes to peel 60 rabbits:

60 rabbits = 60 x 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cut the rabbits. Some rabbits take 5 seconds to cut, while others take the same amount of time as Billie to cut (1.5 minutes). Let's assume that the average time it takes to cut a rabbit is:

Average time to cut a rabbit = (5 seconds + 1.5 minutes) / 2 = 30 seconds + 1.5 minutes = 2.25 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes to cut all 60 rabbits:

60 rabbits = 60 x 2.25 minutes = 135 minutes

So, in total, it would take Billie about 90 minutes to peel and 135 minutes to cut all 60 rabbits, for a total of:

90 minutes + 135 minutes = 225 minutes

Therefore, it would take Billie about 225 minutes (or 3.75 hours) to make the rabbit salad for his large family gathering."	3

Juan and his brother Carlos are selling a gallon of beets for $3.00 and a gallon of sugar for $2.00 each, so they sell 20 coconuts for $0.50 each. If they make $25 profit, how much do they spend on beets?

Answer: $10.

Explanation:
Let's say they sell x gallons of beets and y gallons of sugar.

We know that the total revenue is 20x + 2y, since each coconut costs $0.50 and they sell 20 of them.

We also know that the total cost is 3x + 2y, since each gallon of beets costs $3.00 and each gallon of sugar costs $2.00.

The profit is 25, so we can set up the equation:

20x + 2y - (3x + 2y) = 25

Simplifying the equation:

20x + 2y - 3x - 2y = 25

x + y = 5

Since they sell 20 coconuts, x + y = 20.

Substituting this into the previous equation:

20x + 2y - 3x - 2y = 25

10x + 2y - 3x - 2y = 25

x + 2y = 5

x = 10

So, they spend $10 on beets."	10

Zayed spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and donates half of the rest to his favorite charity. $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses, and $700 for his wife's shopping and other household expenses. If Zayed earns $6,000 a month, how much money would he still have after all these expenses and donations?

Answer:

Zayed spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000.

He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $6,000 - $2,000 = $4,000 / 2 = $2,000.

He spends $200 on his daughter's weekly expenses.

He spends $700 on his wife's shopping and other household expenses.

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zayed would still have:

$6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 - $2,000 = $2,500."	2500

The other team is less agile; their first run is their 400 meters in 60 seconds and after each lap they run the next race 3 seconds faster than the previous race. Using this information, which team is the fastest second winner?

Answer: The second team.

Explanation:

The first team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds, so their average speed is:

55 seconds / 400 meters = 0.1375 meters/second

The second team's first runner runs in 60 seconds, so their average speed is:

60 seconds / 400 meters = 0.15 meters/second

The second team's second runner runs in 57 seconds, so their average speed is:

188	If a merchant buys a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and if the merchant sells each sack for $30 and makes a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
If a merchant buys a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and if the merchant sells each sack for $30 and makes a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 

The merchant sold 10 sacks of wheat.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. The merchant buys each sack of wheat from the farmer for $20.
2. Each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse.
3. The merchant sells each sack for $30.
4. The merchant makes a total profit of $400.

Now, let's use algebra to find the number of sacks the merchant sold:

Let x be the number of sacks the merchant sold.

Since the merchant buys each sack for $20, the total cost of x sacks is:

20x

Since each sack costs $2 to transport, the total transportation cost is:

2x

The merchant sells each sack for $30, so the total revenue is:

30x

The merchant makes a total profit of $400, so the total profit is:

400 - (2x + 20x)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

400 - (2x + 20x) = 400 - 22x

Since the merchant makes a profit of $400, we know that the expression above must be positive:

400 - 22x > 0

Solving for x, we get:

22x < 400

x < 20

Since x is a positive integer, we know that x must be less than or equal to 20.

Therefore, the merchant sold 20 sacks of wheat."	20
189	The three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to the show. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. They also travelled on 2 separate stairs, which cost $33 each. If they agreed to share all expenses equally, how much would each of them pay?	34	"Answer only. 
The three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to the show. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. They also travelled on 2 separate stairs, which cost $33 each. If they agreed to share all expenses equally, how much would each of them pay?

Answer:

To find out how much each of the three friends would pay, we need to first calculate the total cost of all expenses.

Total cost = cost of tickets + cost of food + cost of travel

We know that the cost of tickets is $20.25, the cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of tickets, and the cost of travel is $33 each.

So, the total cost is:

Total cost = $20.25 + ($20.25 - $4.50) + $33

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $33

Total cost = $69.75

Since they agreed to share all expenses equally, each of the three friends would pay:

$69.75 ÷ 3 = $23.25

Each friend would pay $23.25."	23

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees will die. How many trees are left?

Answer: 23 trees.

Explanation:

10 years x 10 trees/year = 100 trees

100 trees - 2 trees/year = 98 trees

98 trees x 30% = 29.4 trees (died)

98 trees - 29.4 trees = 68.6 trees (left)

68.6 trees = 23 trees (rounded to the nearest whole number)"	23

200 pounds of carrots distributed to 40 restaurants in a particular city. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots are not used?

Answer: 18 pounds of carrots are not used.

Explanation:

Total weight of carrots = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40

Each restaurant receives = 2 pounds

Total weight of carrots distributed to restaurants = 2 x 40 = 80 pounds

Remaining weight of carrots = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 - 80 = 40 pounds of carrots are not used."	40

Carl's favorite food is sandwiches. This week he ate one sandwich every day for lunch, and used 2 sandwiches on each sandwich. Three days a week he ate an omelet for breakfast rather than an egg and an omelet for a sandwich. He made a big meal of pasta and sandwiches and used 8 sandwiches to save him for lunch that week. How many sandwiches did he use?

I can see that this is a bit confusing, but I'll do my best to help! Let's break down the information we have:

1. Carl ate one sandwich every day for lunch.
2. He used 2 sandwiches on each sandwich.
3. He ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days a week instead of an egg and an omelet for a sandwich.
4. He made a big meal of pasta and sandwiches and used 8 sandwiches to save him for lunch that week.

So, let's see... if Carl ate one sandwich every day for lunch, that's 7 sandwiches (since there are 7 days in a week). And if he used 2 sandwiches on each sandwich, that's 14 sandwiches (2 x 7).

But wait, we're not done yet! Carl also ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days a week, so we need to subtract 3 sandwiches from the total. That leaves us with...

14 sandwiches - 3 sandwiches = 11 sandwiches

So, Carl used 11 sandwiches that week."	11

If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five exams, what score would she need on the sixth exam to get an average of 93?

Note: This is a word problem. Please use complete sentences and show your work.

Solution:

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs to have a total score of 93 x 6 = 558.

She has already scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five exams, so she has a total score of:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448

To find out what score she needs on the sixth exam, we subtract the total score she has already gotten from the total score she needs:

558 - 448 = 110

So, Brinley needs to score at least 110 on the sixth exam to get an average of 93."	93

Michael enjoys cycling. He does it at least five times a week and regularly covers 25 kilometers. He did it for four weeks, then decided to cycle only twice a week, but regularly covers 60 kilometers, and did it for three weeks. How many kilometers did Michael cover in total?

Please provide step-by-step solution.

Answer: 500 kilometers.

Step-by-step solution:

1. When Michael cycled five times a week for four weeks, he covered:

5 times a week x 25 kilometers per week = 125 kilometers per week

Total distance covered in four weeks = 125 kilometers per week x 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

2. When Michael cycled twice a week for three weeks, he covered:

2 times a week x 60 kilometers per week = 120 kilometers per week

Total distance covered in three weeks = 120 kilometers per week x 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered in seven weeks = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers."	860

Joe's bag contains a Halloween caramel, 25 chocolates, and 80 apple caramels. Each chocolate caramel weighs twice as much as a caramel apple. If each chocolate caramel weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of caramels weigh, in grams?

Answer: 1000g.

Explanation:

Since each chocolate caramel weighs twice as much as a caramel apple, we know that:

25 chocolate caramels x 40g/chocolate caramel = 500g
80 caramel apples x 40g/caramel apple = 3200g

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of caramels is:
500g + 3200g = 3700g

209	The total cost of purchasing the 20 balls is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen shares sold for $6,000 each.	145	"Answer only. 
The total cost of purchasing the 20 balls is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen shares sold for $6,000 each.

What is the cost of one share?

Let X be the cost of one share.

We know that the total cost of purchasing 20 balls is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen shares sold for $6,000 each.

So, we can write the equation:

20(X) = 6(6000) - 1200

Simplifying the equation:

20X = 6000 - 1200

20X = 4800

X = 4800/20

X = 240

Therefore, the cost of one share is $240."	240

Sarah takes care of 4 children in the neighborhood, each time she takes care of a child she gets $5. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass. If Sarah saved $10 before she started taking care of the baby, how many times would she have to cut the grass before she could buy a jacket and shoes?

Please help me solve this problem.

Thank you in advance.

Answer:

To find out how many times Sarah needs to cut the grass to buy a jacket and shoes, we need to calculate how much money she will have after each time she cuts the grass and then compare it to the cost of the items she wants to buy.

Let's start by calculating how much money Sarah will have after each time she cuts the grass:

1. First time she cuts the grass:
$10 (savings) + $4 (payment for cutting the grass) = $14
2. Second time she cuts the grass:
$14 (previous amount) + $4 (payment for cutting the grass) = $18
3. Third time she cuts the grass:
$18 (previous amount) + $4 (payment for cutting the grass) = $22

Now, let's compare the amount of money Sarah will have after each time she cuts the grass to the cost of the items she wants to buy:

1. Jacket: $30
	* Sarah will have $22 after the third time she cuts the grass, which is not enough to buy the jacket.
2. First pair of shoes: $20
	* Sarah will have $22 after the third time she cuts the grass, which is enough to buy the first pair of shoes.
3. Second pair of shoes: $20
	* Sarah will have $22 after the third time she cuts the grass, which is not enough to buy the second pair of shoes.

Therefore, Sarah would need to cut the grass 4 times to have enough money to buy a jacket and shoes."	4

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a matching belt for $32. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can make her purchase?

Answer:

Lori has to work 40 hours before she can make her purchase.

Explanation:

To find out how many hours Lori has to work, we need to divide the cost of the shoes and belt by her hourly wage:

$320 + $32 = $352

$352 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Since Lori can only work 40 hours, she has to work 40 hours to make her purchase."	40

Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back 10% more of the money. If she had to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much would Janet have left over in that time?

Answer: $250

Explanation:

The total amount that Janet borrowed is $2000.

She promised to pay back 10% more of the money, which means she will pay back $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200.

If she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months, then she will pay a total of:

12 x $165 = $1980

So, after paying back the loan for 12 months, Janet will have:

$2200 - $1980 = $250

Therefore, Janet will have $250 left over after paying back the loan for 12 months."	12

223	One company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year, and then a third of that amount for the next year.	20000	"Answer only. 
One company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year, and then a third of that amount for the next year.
Another company spends $25,000 on advertising for the first year, and then twice that amount for the second year.

Which company will have the higher total advertising expense over the two-year period?

A) The first company
B) The second company
C) The difference between the two companies is not determinable from the information given.

Please help me with this question. Thank you.

I understand that the question is asking which company will have the higher total advertising expense over the two-year period.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information:

Company A spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year and then $5,000 in the second year, for a total of $20,000 over two years.

Company B spends $25,000 on advertising in the first year and then $50,000 in the second year, for a total of $75,000 over two years.

To determine which company will have the higher total advertising expense, we need to compare the total advertising expense of both companies over the two-year period.

Company A has a total advertising expense of $20,000 over two years, while Company B has a total advertising expense of $75,000 over two years.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) The second company will have the higher total advertising expense over the two-year period."	75000

226	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of rain, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 of the water and buys 14 types of rain, what is the percent chance (sorted to the nearest integer) that the randomly drawn card is the water type?	33	"Answer only. 
James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of rain, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 of the water and buys 14 types of rain, what is the percent chance (sorted to the nearest integer) that the randomly drawn card is the water type?

Please show the steps and the answer.

Answer:

To find the percentage chance of a randomly drawn card being a water type, we need to calculate the number of water cards after losing 8 and buying 14 rain cards.

After losing 8 water cards, James has 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.

After buying 14 rain cards, James has 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total.

The percentage chance of a randomly drawn card being a water type is:

(number of water cards / total number of cards) x 100

= (32 / 46) x 100

= 70%

So, the percent chance of a randomly drawn card being a water type is 70%."	70

230	Mark buys 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10 percent tax on the cars, and then he pays an additional $1,000 for each one. How much does he pay for everything?	276,000	"Answer only. 
Mark buys 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10 percent tax on the cars, and then he pays an additional $1,000 for each one. How much does he pay for everything?

Answer: 

$240,000

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the tax on the cars:

12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Tax on cars:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Finally, we add the additional $1,000 for each car:

$264,000 + (12 x $1,000) = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, Mark pays $276,000 for everything."	276000
231	Kyle and Robert enjoy going to the beach and collecting seashells. On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more seashells than Robert collects 20. On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many seashells as she did on Monday.	50	"Answer only. 
Kyle and Robert enjoy going to the beach and collecting seashells. On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more seashells than Robert collects 20. On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many seashells as she did on Monday.

How many seashells will Kyle collect on Tuesday?

Let's use ""K"" to represent the number of seashells Kyle collects on Monday and ""T"" to represent the number of seashells Kyle collects on Tuesday.

We know that Kyle collects 5 more seashells than Robert on Monday, so K = 20 + 5 = 25.

On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many seashells as she did on Monday, so T = 2 \* 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kyle will collect 50 seashells on Tuesday."	50

234	Steve decided to start eating more tomatoes and decided to grow his own tomato cherry. Even his girlfriend eats twice as much, 6 times a day. If a vineyard can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how much wine does it need?	21	"Answer only. 
Steve decided to start eating more tomatoes and decided to grow his own tomato cherry. Even his girlfriend eats twice as much, 6 times a day. If a vineyard can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how much wine does it need?

If Steve and his girlfriend eat 6 times a day, that means they eat 6 x 6 = 36 tomatoes per day.

If a vineyard can produce 3 tomatoes per week, that means it can produce 3 x 7 = 21 tomatoes per week.

So, to make enough wine for Steve and his girlfriend, the vineyard needs 36 tomatoes per day x 7 days per week = 252 tomatoes per week."	252

Mike had 5 co-writers in the company. He stopped writing to 2 of them. Each of them sent 2 letters a week that were 5 pages long. He replied the same. He could write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours a week did he spend writing?

I'm happy to help! Let's work through this together.

So, Mike had 5 co-writers, and he stopped writing to 2 of them. That means he was only writing to 3 co-writers.

Each of the 3 co-writers sent 2 letters per week, and each letter was 5 pages long. That's a total of 6 letters per week (2 x 3 x 5).

Mike replied to each letter, and he could write a page in 6 minutes. So, to reply to 6 letters, he spent 6 x 6 = 36 minutes writing per week.

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

36 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.6 hours

Therefore, Mike spent 0.6 hours per week writing."	0
243	Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1000 minutes. He has 15 minutes every day with his boss on the phone, and an additional 300 minutes this month with other people. If this month has 30 days, how many minutes does Jason have left?	250	"Answer only. 
Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1000 minutes. He has 15 minutes every day with his boss on the phone, and an additional 300 minutes this month with other people. If this month has 30 days, how many minutes does Jason have left?

Answer: 650 minutes

Explanation:

15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

750 minutes - 1000 minutes (monthly plan) = 650 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 650 minutes left this month."	650

Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle received 5. Bill received twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin her full hand of fries, and then Colby received 3 fewer fries from Griffin than Kyle received. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many Ginger fries did Kyle give Griffin?

Answer: 5

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. Griffin had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle received 5 fries from Griffin.
3. Bill received twice as many fries as Kyle.
4. Ginger gave Griffin her full hand of fries.
5. Colby received 3 fewer fries from Griffin than Kyle received.

Now, let's use this information to figure out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin:

Since Bill received twice as many fries as Kyle, Bill received 2 x 5 = 10 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin her full hand of fries, so Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries.

Colby received 3 fewer fries from Griffin than Kyle received, so Colby received 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now we can add up all the fries that were given to Griffin:

24 (Ginger's fries) + 10 (Bill's fries) + 2 (Colby's fries) = 36

So, Ginger gave Griffin 5 fries."	5

Isabel spent $12 for the cake, $43 for the birthday present, $15 for the flowers, $4 for the invitation, and $22 for a nice bag for the guests. She divided the cost with her two parents into three parts. How much did each person pay?

Let's call the total cost of all the items $T.

Isabel spent $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $94 on all the items.

Since she divided the cost with her two parents into three parts, each person paid $94 / 3 = $31.

So, each parent paid $31, and Isabel paid $31 as well."	31

On Monday, Sue ate four times her sister's cookie, on Tuesday she ate twice her sister's cookie, on Monday she ate five cookies, and the next day she ate 13 cookies. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?

Answer: 240 calories

Explanation:

Let X be the number of cookies Sue's sister ate.

On Monday, Sue ate 4X cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2X cookies.

In total, Sue ate 4X + 2X = 6X cookies.

Since Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday, she ate 5 - 1 = 4 cookies more than her sister on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 13 cookies, so she ate 13 - 2X = 13 - 2(X) cookies more than her sister on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 4X + 13 - 2X = 4X + 11 cookies more than her sister.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 4X + 11 \* 200 = 800 + 2200 = 3000 calories more than her sister."	3000
