Janet's duck lays 16 eggs a day. She eats three for breakfast each day and uses four to make muffins for her friends each day. She sells the rest at the farmers' market for $2 a day for one duck egg. How many dollars does she make a day at the farmers' market?

Answer: $6 per day.

Explanation:

Janet's duck lays 16 eggs per day.

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast each day, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She uses 4 eggs to make muffins for her friends each day, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, so she makes $9 x $2 = $18 per day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market."	18

2	Josh decides to sell a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and invests $55,000 in repairs. This raises the price of the house by about 150%. How much profit will he make?	70000	"Answer only. 
Josh decides to sell a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and invests $55,000 in repairs. This raises the price of the house by about 150%. How much profit will he make?

Answer: $135,000

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the original price of the house before Josh made any repairs.

Original price = $80,000

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the repairs.

Cost of repairs = $55,000

Now, we need to calculate the new price of the house after the repairs.

New price = Original price + Cost of repairs

New price = $80,000 + $55,000

New price = $135,000

Finally, we need to calculate the profit.

Profit = New price - Original price

Profit = $135,000 - $80,000

Profit = $55,000

Therefore, Josh will make a profit of $55,000 if he sells the house for $135,000 after making $55,000 worth of repairs."	55000

5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass cost $5, but each second glass cost only 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for them?	64	"Answer only. 
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass cost $5, but each second glass cost only 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for them?

Answer: $100.

Explanation:

Since the second glass costs 60% of the original price, the second glass costs $5 x 0.6 = $3.

If Kylar buys 16 glasses, she will need to pay 16 x $3 = $48 for the second set of glasses.

In total, Kylar will pay $5 x 16 = $80 for the first set of glasses and $48 for the second set of glasses, for a total of $128."	128
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleson. Charleson has four times as many sheep as Seattle has. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleson, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleson. Charleson has four times as many sheep as Seattle has. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleson, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?

Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep each city has:

Toulouse has 2x sheep, so Toulouse has 2x sheep.

Charleson has 4x sheep, so Charleson has 4x sheep.

Seattle has 20 sheep, so Seattle has 20 sheep.

We want to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleson, and Seattle have together. To do this, we can add the number of sheep each city has:

2x + 4x + 20 = ?

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4x + 20 = 6x + 20

Solving for the unknown variable x:

6x + 20 = 30

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

6x = 10

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 10/6

x = 1

So Toulouse has 2x = 2 sheep, Charleson has 4x = 4 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep. Together, they have 2 + 4 + 20 = 26 sheep."	26

Carla downloads a two hundred GB file. It usually takes a minute to download two GB, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a reboot in order to introduce an update. which takes twenty minutes. Then Carla reboots to do the download. How long did it take to download the file?

Let x be the time it takes to download 2 GB.

Since 40% of the file has been downloaded, the time it takes to download the remaining 160 GB is:

160 GB / (2 GB/x) = 80 x

Since the update takes 20 minutes, the total time to download the file is:

John drives three hours at a 60mph convention and turns around because he realizes that he forgot to take an essential nap at home. He wants to get home in four hours but he spends the first two hours stuck in a queue of cars. He spends another half hour driving at a 30mph convention, before spending the remaining four hours at a 80mph convention. What is his rank at the end of those four hours?

Please provide a detailed solution, step by step.

Answer:

John's rank at the end of four hours is 120 miles.

Step-by-step solution:

1. John drives for two hours at a 60mph convention, covering a distance of:

2 hours x 60 mph = 120 miles

2. He then spends half an hour stuck in a queue of cars, so he covers no distance during this time.

3. He spends the next two hours driving at a 30mph convention, covering a distance of:

2 hours x 30 mph = 60 miles

4. Finally, he spends the remaining two hours driving at an 80mph convention, covering a distance of:

2 hours x 80 mph = 160 miles

5. Therefore, John's total distance traveled in four hours is:

120 miles + 60 miles + 160 miles = 340 miles

6. So, John's rank at the end of four hours is:

340 miles / 4 hours = 85 miles per hour

Therefore, John's rank at the end of four hours is 120 miles."	120

How many downloads did the plans have in total over the three months?	366	"Answer only. 
New plans had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times higher than the number of downloads in the first month, but then it increased to about 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the plans have in total over the three months?

Answer: 

Let's start by finding the number of downloads in the first month. If there were 60 downloads in the first month, then there were 60 downloads.

Now, let's find the number of downloads in the second month. If the number of downloads in the second month was three times higher than the number of downloads in the first month, then the number of downloads in the second month would be:

3 x 60 = 180

So, there were 180 downloads in the second month.

Now, let's find the number of downloads in the third month. If the number of downloads in the third month increased by 30% from the number of downloads in the second month, then the number of downloads in the third month would be:

180 x 1.3 = 240

So, there were 240 downloads in the third month.

In total, there were:

60 + 180 + 240 = 480

downloads over the three months."	480

12	Carlos grows an orange tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year he grows seven oranges, with a rat for $1.5. Each year it costs $3 to water and feed the plants. How many years does it take for him to start making money from the orange tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos grows an orange tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year he grows seven oranges, with a rat for $1.5. Each year it costs $3 to water and feed the plants. How many years does it take for him to start making money from the orange tree?

Answer: 6 years.

Explanation:

1. Initial investment: $90 (to plant the tree)
2. Annual expenses: $3 (water and feed) + $1.5 (rat) = $4.5
3. Annual income: 7 oranges x $1.5 = $10.5
4. Profit/loss: $10.5 - $4.5 = $6
5. Break-even point: $90 + $4.5 = $94.5
6. Time to break-even: $94.5 / $10.5 = 9 years

So, it takes 9 years for Carlos to start making money from the orange tree."	9

14	In a class of 20 music students, 20% enrolled in performing contemporary music, 25% enrolled in jazz, and the rest enrolled in electronic music. What percentage of students enrolled in electronic music?	60	"Answer only. 
In a class of 20 music students, 20% enrolled in performing contemporary music, 25% enrolled in jazz, and the rest enrolled in electronic music. What percentage of students enrolled in electronic music?

Answer: 40%

Explanation:
Let X be the number of students who enrolled in electronic music.
Since 20% of the students enrolled in performing contemporary music, the number of students who enrolled in performing contemporary music is 20% of 20, which is:
20% of 20 = 4

So, there are 4 students who enrolled in performing contemporary music.

Since 25% of the students enrolled in jazz, the number of students who enrolled in jazz is 25% of 20, which is:
25% of 20 = 5

So, there are 5 students who enrolled in jazz.

Now, let's find out the number of students who enrolled in electronic music. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in performing contemporary music and jazz from the total number of students:

X = 20 - 4 - 5 = 11

So, there are 11 students who enrolled in electronic music.

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in electronic music is:

X / 20 = 11 / 20 = 0.55 = 55%"	55
15	A merchant wants to make a trade choice between two business plans: Gold is $5,000 or electronics is $8,000. His financial advisor expects metal sales to rise 2.5% while electronics will rise 1.2% in the same month. If this merchant wants to make the most profit at the end of the month by making a trade choice, what would this value be?	125	"Answer only. 
A merchant wants to make a trade choice between two business plans: Gold is $5,000 or electronics is $8,000. His financial advisor expects metal sales to rise 2.5% while electronics will rise 1.2% in the same month. If this merchant wants to make the most profit at the end of the month by making a trade choice, what would this value be?

Please note that this is a profit maximization problem, and the merchant wants to choose the option that will give the highest profit at the end of the month.

Answer:

The profit can be calculated as follows:

For Gold:
Profit = Sales Price - Cost Price
= $5,000 - $4,500
= $500

For Electronics:
Profit = Sales Price - Cost Price
= $8,000 - $7,200
= $800

Since the profit from selling electronics is higher than that of gold, the merchant should choose to sell electronics to maximize their profit at the end of the month.

Therefore, the answer is:

The merchant should choose to sell electronics."	800

17	Jill is paid $20 per hour to teach classes and $30 to be a wellness coach. If she works 51 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Answer only. 
Jill is paid $20 per hour to teach classes and $30 to be a wellness coach. If she works 51 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?

Answer: $58,600

Explanation:

To calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher, we need to multiply the number of hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works per year.

35 hours/week x 51 weeks/year = 1,755 hours/year

Jill's annual salary as a teacher is $20/hour x 1,755 hours/year = $35,100

To calculate Jill's annual salary as a wellness coach, we need to multiply the number of hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works per year.

15 hours/week x 51 weeks/year = 780 hours/year

Jill's annual salary as a wellness coach is $30/hour x 780 hours/year = $23,400

Adding Jill's annual salary as a teacher and her annual salary as a wellness coach gives us her total annual salary:

$35,100 + $23,400 = $58,600"	58600

19	Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles. She walks 4 miles an hour and then another 2 miles an hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to go the rest of the way?	6	"Answer only. 
Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles. She walks 4 miles an hour and then another 2 miles an hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to go the rest of the way?

Answer: 3 miles per hour.

Explanation:

To find out what speed Marissa needs to go the rest of the way, we need to find out her total distance traveled.

Total distance = 4 miles/hour x 4 hours + 2 miles/hour x 2 hours

Total distance = 16 miles + 4 miles

Total distance = 20 miles

Marissa needs to go the rest of the way at a speed of 3 miles per hour to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

20 miles / 3 miles/hour = 6 hours

Therefore, Marissa needs to go the rest of the way at a speed of 3 miles per hour for 6 hours."	6

28	Henry made two stops on his sixty-mile bicycle trip. The first stop was after he had covered twenty miles. The second stop was fifteen miles before he reached the finish line. How many miles did he travel between the first and second stops?	25	"Answer only. 
Henry made two stops on his sixty-mile bicycle trip. The first stop was after he had covered twenty miles. The second stop was fifteen miles before he reached the finish line. How many miles did he travel between the first and second stops?

Answer: 35 miles.

Explanation:

Let's say Henry traveled x miles between the first and second stops.

We know that the first stop was after he had covered 20 miles, so:

20 + x = 35 (since he traveled 35 miles between the first and second stops)

We also know that the second stop was 15 miles before the finish line, so:

x + 15 = 60 (since Henry traveled 60 miles in total)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:

x = 35

So, Henry traveled 35 miles between the first and second stops."	35

Gloria buys a new pair of shoes each time a pair matches the price of a pair of shoes. However, she has to choose between a pair of high-heeled boots that cost $5 each to borrow more money than a pair of shoes. If the price of a pair of high-heeled boots is $33 and the price of the other pair is twice as high, how much is the shoe worth?

Answer: $66.

Explanation: Let's say the price of the other pair of shoes is $x. Then, the price of the high-heeled boots is $33, and the price of the other pair of shoes is $2x.

Gloria will choose the high-heeled boots if the price of the other pair of shoes is more than $5 more than the price of the high-heeled boots. In other words, if the price of the other pair of shoes is $33 + $5 = $38.

So, we can set up the equation:

$33 + $5 = $38

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = $66

Therefore, the price of the other pair of shoes is $66, and the price of the high-heeled boots is $33."	33

According to nutritional information, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has five servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily caloric intake is 2,000 calories and you have already eaten 1,800 calories?

Answer:

To find out how many chips you could eat, we need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day.

2000 - 1800 = 200

You have 200 calories left for the day.

Since one serving of chips has 250 calories, you could eat:

200 / 250 = 0.8

or 8 servings of chips.

Therefore, if your daily caloric intake is 2,000 calories and you have already eaten 1,800 calories, you could eat 8 servings of chips (300g)."	300

Charlie has a mouse that can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax. If he sells each candle for $2.00, he needs to know how much profit he will make if he sells 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the cost of producing 20 candles:

20 candles x $10.00 per pound of beeswax = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Sales - Cost
= $200.00 - $200.00
= $0.00

So, Charlie will not make any profit if he sells 20 candles at $2.00 each."	2

Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and passes them on to her employers every day as part of her day-to-day work. A blogging job takes an average of four hours to research and write about. Last weekend, she posted five times more on Mondays and two-fifths more on Tuesdays than on Mondays. On Wednesdays, she posted twice as many posts as she did on Tuesdays. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing over the three days.

Answer: 

Answer: 16 hours

Explanation:

Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. On Mondays, Meredith posted five times more than her usual posts.
2. On Tuesdays, she posted two-fifths more than her usual posts.
3. On Wednesdays, she posted twice as many posts as she did on Tuesdays.

We can start by finding out how many posts Meredith usually writes on a typical day:

Let's assume that Meredith writes x posts per day (where x is a constant).

Now, let's find out how many posts she wrote on each day:

1. Mondays: 5x posts (since she posted five times more than her usual posts)
2. Tuesdays: 2(2/5)x posts (since she posted two-fifths more than her usual posts)
3. Wednesdays: 2x posts (since she posted twice as many posts as she did on Tuesdays)

Now, let's calculate the total number of posts Meredith wrote over the three days:

Monday: 5x posts = 5x
Tuesday: 2(2/5)x posts = 2x
Wednesday: 2x posts = 2x

Total number of posts = 5x + 2x + 2x = 9x

Since each post takes an average of four hours to research and write, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing over the three days is:

Total number of hours = 9x \* 4 hours/post = 36x

Therefore, the total number of hours Mer"	36

If she had 23 Post-its left in all, how many Post-its were in the packet she bought?

Answer: 23.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of Post-its in the packet Candice bought.

We know that Candice put one Post-it on top of each of the 220 coffee cups waiting in line, so she used 220 Post-its.

We also know that she had 23 Post-its left in all, so the total number of Post-its she had is:

51	Tom's boat will travel at a speed of ten miles per hour. He drives from 1 to 4PM. He returns at a speed of 6 mph. How long does it take him to get back?	5	"Answer only. 
Tom's boat will travel at a speed of ten miles per hour. He drives from 1 to 4PM. He returns at a speed of 6 mph. How long does it take him to get back?

Answer: 2 hours.

Explanation:

To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know his return speed and the distance he needs to travel. Since he travels at a speed of 6 mph, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know that the distance he needs to travel is the distance from 4PM to his starting point, which is 1PM. This distance is 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now we can plug in the values:

Time = 180 minutes / 6 mph

Time = 30 minutes

So it takes Tom 30 minutes (or 2 hours) to get back to his starting point."	2

A wooden bed and a rack of no more than five thousand pounds. A service cart full of identical boxes, each weighing fifteen pounds, will cross the bed. The total weight of the driver on the cart is at least three thousand seven hundred and fifty-five pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed?

I'm having trouble with this problem. Could you help me?

I've tried to use the weight of the driver to find the maximum weight of the boxes, but I'm not sure how to do that.

Here's what I have so far:

Let x be the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart.

The total weight of the boxes is 15x pounds.

The total weight of the driver and the boxes is 3755 + 15x pounds.

I want to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the condition that the total weight is less than or equal to the weight limit of the bed (5000 pounds).

I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Could you help me?

Thank you!

Answer:

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The total weight of the driver is 3755 pounds.
2. The total weight of the boxes is 15x pounds.
3. The total weight of the cart (driver + boxes) is 3755 + 15x pounds.
4. The weight limit of the bed is 5000 pounds.

Now, we can set up an inequality to represent the problem:

3755 + 15x ≤ 5000

To solve for x, we can subtract 3755 from both sides:

15x ≤ 1245

Now, we can divide both sides by 15:

x ≤ 82

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed is 82."	82

Sheila bought five phones for $150 each to pay the monthly rent for three months. There will be a 2% surcharge for each month. How much more will Sheila have to pay each month for three months?

Answer:

For the first month, Sheila will pay $150 x 2% = $3 for each phone, so she will pay $3 x 5 phones = $15 extra for the first month.

For the second month, Sheila will pay $150 x 2% = $3 for each phone, so she will pay $3 x 5 phones = $15 extra for the second month.

For the third month, Sheila will pay $150 x 2% = $3 for each phone, so she will pay $3 x 5 phones = $15 extra for the third month.

Therefore, Sheila will have to pay an extra $15 x 3 months = $45 for the three months."	45

Luke was spending time on the beach building sand houses. He eventually figured out that each sand house would have a floor that was half the square footage of the one below it. If it was a four-story sand house and the top floor had 16 squares, what was the average square footage of its one floor?

Please provide the steps to find the answer.

Answer: 4 squares.

Step 1: Identify the pattern of the floors.

Since each floor has half the square footage of the one below it, we can identify the pattern of the floors as:

Floor 1: 16 squares
Floor 2: 8 squares (half of 16)
Floor 3: 4 squares (half of 8)
Floor 4: 2 squares (half of 4)

Step 2: Determine the square footage of the top floor.

We want to find the average square footage of the top floor, which is Floor 4.

Floor 4 has 2 squares.

Step 3: Calculate the average square footage.

To calculate the average square footage, we add up all the square footages of the floors and divide by the number of floors.

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

30 / 4 = 7.5

77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David does, add up the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does four hundred pounds.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David does, add up the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does four hundred pounds.

Answer:

Let's say Sarah does four hundred pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, he does half of four hundred pounds, which is two hundred pounds.

Since David does four times as much laundry as Raymond, he does four times two hundred pounds, which is eight hundred pounds.

So, the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is eight hundred pounds - two hundred pounds = six hundred pounds."	-1
78	Vincent has a mouse that buys three bouquets of flowers for $2.50 or two bouquets for $1. And how much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at a better price?	6	"Answer only. 
Vincent has a mouse that buys three bouquets of flowers for $2.50 or two bouquets for $1. And how much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at a better price?

Answer:

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at $2.50 each, he will pay $2.50 x 18 = $45.

If he buys 18 flowers at $1 each, he will pay $1 x 18 = $18.

Therefore, by buying 18 flowers at $1 each, Vincent saves $45 - $18 = $27."	27

Christina is planning her birthday party and needs .75 gift bags for each guest, because four of the guests didn't show up. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag is $2. How much will it cost?

Answer: $4.00

Explanation:

16 guests x 0.75 gift bags per guest = 12 gift bags (round down to the nearest whole number)

12 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $24

Since four guests didn't show up, Christina will only need to purchase 12 gift bags, so the total cost will be $24."	24

91	Jan has three times as many coins as Marcia. Marcia has two more coins than Cindy. If Cindy has four coins, how many coins do the three of them have in total?	28	"Answer only. 
Jan has three times as many coins as Marcia. Marcia has two more coins than Cindy. If Cindy has four coins, how many coins do the three of them have in total?

Let's assume that Jan has 3x coins, Marcia has 2x coins and Cindy has 4 coins.

We know that Jan has three times as many coins as Marcia, so:

3x = 2x + 2

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 2x + 2
2x = 2x + 2
x = 4

So, Jan has 3x = 4 \* 3 = 12 coins.
Marcia has 2x = 4 \* 2 = 8 coins.
Cindy has 4 coins.

In total, the three of them have:
12 + 8 + 4 = 24 coins."	24

95	Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls in girl scouts. How many girls are not in girl scouts?	40	"Answer only. 
Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls in girl scouts. How many girls are not in girl scouts?

Answer: 40 girls are not in girl scouts.

Explanation:
Let's use the information we know to set up an equation. Let G be the number of girls in Girl Scouts.

Two-fifths of the students are boys, so the number of boys is 2/5 of 200, or 40 boys.

Two-thirds of the students are girls in Girl Scouts, so the number of girls in Girl Scouts is 2/3 of 200, or 133 girls.

Now we can set up an equation:

G + 40 = 133

Solving for G, we get:

G = 93

So there are 93 girls in Girl Scouts. To find out how many girls are not in Girl Scouts, we can subtract the number of girls in Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

40 (not in Girl Scouts) = 200 - 93

Therefore, there are 40 girls not in Girl Scouts."	40

97	When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes. The last tomato sauce Freda made contained 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Answer only. 
When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes. The last tomato sauce Freda made contained 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?

Answer: 4 cans of tomatoes. 

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
* The last tomato sauce Freda made contained 32 ounces of sauce.

We know that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, if we divide the amount of sauce by 2, we can find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used:

32 ounces / 2 = 16 ounces

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many cans Freda used:

16 ounces / 3 = 4 cans

Therefore, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes to make the last tomato sauce."	4

Jamal's phone has six times more mice than Brittany's. Especially since Brittany's phone has 50 times more mice than the bird in Jamal's picture with the duck in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has 1,800 mice, how many mice do you have to see that Jamal's duck is in the zoo?

Please help me with this problem. I have no idea how to approach it.

Answer:

This problem is a play on words and requires a bit of creative thinking. The key to solving it is to notice that the phrase ""Jamal's duck is in the zoo"" can be interpreted in two different ways:

1. Jamal's duck is physically located in a zoo.
2. Jamal's duck is ""in the zoo"" of his phone, meaning it is one of the many images on his phone.

Given that Brittany's phone has 50 times more mice than the bird in Jamal's picture with the duck in the zoo, we can infer that Brittany's phone has 50 x 1,800 = 90,000 mice.

Therefore, to see that Jamal's duck is in the zoo, we need to look at the picture of the duck in the zoo on Jamal's phone, which has 6 times more mice than Brittany's phone. So, we need to look at 6 x 90,000 = 540,000 mice."	540000

Sasha found that the value of the lumba had gone up by 50% in the last few months after buying some lumba. Since she had some left over, she decided to sell them. She had 2 x 4 x 10 trees left that cost $10 each, and 4 x 4 x 10 trees she bought for $16 each. If she sold them all, how much profit would she make?

Answer:
$120

Explanation:
First, calculate the total cost of the lumba trees Sasha has:

2 x 4 x 10 trees x $10 each = $800
4 x 4 x 10 trees x $16 each = $1,280
Total cost = $800 + $1,280 = $2,080

Next, calculate the total value of the lumba trees Sasha has:

2 x 4 x 10 trees x $16 each = $3,200
4 x 4 x 10 trees x $16 each = $6,400
Total value = $3,200 + $6,400 = $9,600

Now, calculate the profit:

Profit = Total value - Total cost
= $9,600 - $2,080
= $7,520

Therefore, Sasha would make a profit of $7,520 if she sold all the lumba trees."	7520

A customs official at SeaSide counted two containers loaded with five trucks each, and the next day more were loaded, bringing the total to 30. What would be the number of containers loaded on the second day if there were five trucks?

Answer: 25.

Explanation:

The first day, two containers were loaded with five trucks each, so the total number of trucks loaded on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10.

On the second day, there were five trucks loaded into each of the two containers, so the total number of trucks loaded on the second day is 2 x 5 = 10.

Therefore, the total number of trucks loaded on both days is 10 + 10 = 20.

Since each container can hold five trucks, the number of containers loaded on the second day is 20 / 5 = 25."	25

Adrien's total salary is 30 percent higher than Lylah's. After four years, her salary has increased, and she receives 40% more than she did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien received $40,000 four years ago, what is the total salary they both receive four years later?

Answer: $72,800

Explanation:

Let's assume that Lylah's salary four years ago was x.

Lylah's current salary is 40% more than her salary four years ago, so her current salary is:

x + (40% of x) = x + 0.4x = 1.4x

We know that Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so Adrien's current salary is:

30% more than 1.4x = 1.3 x 1.4x = 1.84x

We know that Adrien received $40,000 four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

1.84x = 40,000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22,222

Therefore, Lylah's current salary is:

Lylah's current salary = 1.4x = 31,100

Adrien's current salary = 1.84x = 40,000

So, the total salary they both receive four years later is:

Total salary = Lylah's current salary + Adrien's current salary = 31,100 + 40,000 = 72,800."	72800

122	Sadie slept eight hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept two hours less, each time, because she used it to make a face mask. If the rest of the weekend she slept an hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in all those weekends?	48	"Answer only. 
Sadie slept eight hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept two hours less, each time, because she used it to make a face mask. If the rest of the weekend she slept an hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in all those weekends?

Answer: 9 hours.

Explanation:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours (she slept 2 hours less)
Wednesday: 6 - 2 = 4 hours (she slept 2 hours less)
Thursday: 4 + 1 = 5 hours (she slept 1 hour more)
Friday: 5 + 1 = 6 hours (she slept 1 hour more)
Saturday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours (she slept 1 hour more)
Sunday: 7 + 1 = 8 hours (she slept 1 hour more)

Total hours slept: 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 9 hours."	9

Jennie helps in her mother's office. She has a pool of sixty large letters that need stamping in a pool of large letters that have already been stamped. She has stamped one-third of the letters that need stamping. If there are now thirty letters in a pool of stamped letters, how many letters were in the pool when Jennie started?

Let X be the number of letters in the pool when Jennie started.

We know that Jennie has stamped one-third of the letters that need stamping, so the number of letters she has stamped is:

X/3

We also know that there are now thirty letters in the pool of stamped letters, so the total number of letters in the pool (stamped and unstamped) is:

X + 30

We can set up the equation:

X/3 + X = X + 30

Simplifying the equation:

2X/3 = X + 30

Solving for X:

X = 90

So, there were 90 letters in the pool when Jennie started."	90

Mother Well sells watermelon, peaches and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times the price of any peach. The price of an orange is five times less than the price of watermelon. Dillon was sent to the store to buy four watermelons, twenty peaches and ten oranges. How much would he spend in total if the price of a peach was $15?

Answer: $56.25

Explanation:

Let x be the price of a watermelon.
Since a watermelon costs three times the price of a peach,
the price of a peach is $x/3.

The price of an orange is five times less than the price of a watermelon,
so the price of an orange is $x/5.

Dillon needs to buy four watermelons, so he will spend 4x on watermelons.
He needs to buy twenty peaches, so he will spend 20(x/3) on peaches.
He needs to buy ten oranges, so he will spend 10(x/5) on oranges.

Total cost = 4x + 20(x/3) + 10(x/5)

Simplifying, we get:
Total cost = 4x + 60x/15 + 10x/5

Total cost = 4x + 60x/15 + 10x

Total cost = 70x/15

Since Dillon needs to buy four watermelons, twenty peaches, and ten oranges,
the total cost is:

Total cost = 70x/15 = 56.25

Therefore, the total cost would be $56.25 if the price of a peach was $15."	15
129	A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the hospital and hospitals charge patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?	10000	"Answer only. 
A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the hospital and hospitals charge patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Please show your calculations.

Answer:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

First, we need to calculate the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Number of patients x Average time per patient x Doctor's fee per hour x Hospital's fee per hour

Total Revenue = 500 patients x 24 minutes x $150 per hour x $200 per hour

Total Revenue = $1,500,000

Next, we need to calculate the total cost:

Total Cost = Number of patients x Average time per patient x Doctor's fee per hour

Total Cost = 500 patients x 24 minutes x $150 per hour

Total Cost = $750,000

Now, we can calculate the profit:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Profit = $1,500,000 - $750,000

Profit = $750,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $750,000 from these visits."	750000
130	Nissa hired overtime workers to play the role of elves in her store in Santa Fe. One-third of the workers quit after being kicked by children, and ten percent quit after being kicked by children. How many elves are left?	30	"Answer only. 
Nissa hired overtime workers to play the role of elves in her store in Santa Fe. One-third of the workers quit after being kicked by children, and ten percent quit after being kicked by children. How many elves are left?

Answer: 12 elves are left.

Explanation:

Let's say there were x elves initially.

One-third of the workers quit after being kicked by children, so:

x/3 = 2 (since 2/3 of the workers quit)

x = 6 (since 2 x 3 = 6)

Now, ten percent of the remaining workers quit after being kicked by children, so:

6/10 = 0.6 (since 0.6 of the workers quit)

0.6 x 6 = 3.6

Therefore, there are 3.6 elves left.

Since we cannot have a fraction of an elf, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 elves left.

So, there are 4 elves left in Nissa's store in Santa Fe."	4

Johnny is playing with a sledgehammer on the floor of his house, and he pulls out a Lego that has 500 bricks on the floor, another that is three times the size of the original 500, and another that is one-fourth the number of bricks.

What is the total number of Lego bricks?

Please explain your answer.

Answer:

The total number of Lego bricks is 500 + 3 x 500 + 1/4 x 500 = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2250.

Explanation:

The first Lego has 500 bricks, so we add that to the total.

The second Lego is three times the size of the original, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 bricks. We add that to the total.

The third Lego is one-fourth the size of the original, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 bricks. We add that to the total.

Therefore, the total number of Lego bricks is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2250."	2250

Debra observed the number of bees coming and going in a day. She saw thirty bees leaving the zoo in the first six hours, and she saw that one-half and many bees returned in the next six hours. She saw twice as many bees as she had previously seen leaving the zoo flying out of the zoo and leaving in the next six hours. When any of the bees that had not returned returned returned to the zoo in the next six hours. How many animals did Debra see return to the zoo in the last six hours of the day?

Answer: 20 bees returned to the zoo in the last six hours of the day.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of bees that returned to the zoo in the first six hours.
Since one-half of the bees returned in the next six hours, so x/2 returned in the next six hours.
Since twice as many bees left the zoo in the next six hours as had left in the first six hours, so 2x left the zoo in the next six hours.
So, the total number of bees that left the zoo in the first six hours plus the number of bees that returned in the next six hours is equal to the total number of bees that left the zoo in the next six hours plus the number of bees that returned in the last six hours:

30 + x/2 + 2x = 2x + x/2 + 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 + x/2 + 2x = 4x + 20

Subtracting x/2 from both sides gives us:

2x + 20 = 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

20 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 10

So, x = 10 bees returned to the zoo in the first six hours.

Therefore, 20 - 10 = 10 bees returned to the zoo in the last six hours."	10

Steve lives three miles from school and has a bicycle speed of 440 beats per minute. Tim lives two miles from school. If Tim has a skateboard speed of 264 beats per minute, how long will the winner be at home before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: 3 minutes and 48 seconds.

Step-by-step solution:

1. Convert Tim's skateboard speed to miles per hour:

264 beats per minute / 60 (seconds per minute) = 4.4 miles per hour

2. Convert Steve's bicycle speed to miles per hour:

440 beats per minute / 60 (seconds per minute) = 7.33 miles per hour

3. Calculate the time it takes for Tim to finish the race:

Distance = 2 miles
Speed = 4.4 miles per hour
Time = distance / speed = 2 miles / 4.4 miles per hour = 0.45 hours

Time in minutes = 0.45 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 27 minutes

4. Calculate the time it takes for Steve to finish the race:

Distance = 3 miles
Speed = 7.33 miles per hour
Time = distance / speed = 3 miles / 7.33 miles per hour = 0.41 hours

Time in minutes = 0.41 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 24.6 minutes

5. Calculate the time difference between the two finish times:

Time difference = 27 minutes (Tim's finish time) - 24.6 minutes (Steve's finish time) = 2.4 minutes

6. Convert the time difference to seconds:

Time difference (in seconds) = 2.4 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 144 seconds

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be at home for 3 minutes and 48 seconds before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."	48

Three pigeons snatched it and the food, each pigeon ate three french fries. Then, the pigeon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. The last ant took out the remaining french fries, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the package when Dave bought it?

Answer: 19

Explanation:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries, so there were 19 - 14 = 5 left in the package.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, which is half of 5 = 2.5. Since the seagull can only eat whole fries, it ate 2 fries, leaving 3 fries.
3. The three pigeons ate 3 fries each, leaving 3 - 3 = 0 fries.
4. The pigeon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is two-thirds of 0 = 0.
5. The last ant took out the remaining fries, which is 5 - 0 = 5 fries.

156	A zookeeper who feeds a human in a zoo. He counts all the bananas from a nearby farm every two months. If a monkey needs 200 bananas, a rooster needs 400 bananas and a frog needs 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should he buy to have a mouse for two months?	1400	"Answer only. 
A zookeeper who feeds a human in a zoo. He counts all the bananas from a nearby farm every two months. If a monkey needs 200 bananas, a rooster needs 400 bananas and a frog needs 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should he buy to have a mouse for two months?

This is a classic brain teaser, and the answer is 1 banana.

The reason is that the zookeeper does not feed bananas to the animals, he counts them. So, he does not need to buy any bananas for the animals, only for himself. And, as a human, he only needs one banana for two months."	1

162	If a sack of marble drops $20 and the price rises 20% from the original price every two months, how much will the sack of marble fall after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a sack of marble drops $20 and the price rises 20% from the original price every two months, how much will the sack of marble fall after 36 months?

Hint: Calculate the price of the sack of marble after each two-month period and find the total cost after 36 months.

Answer: $40

Explanation:

1. Original price: $100
2. Price after 2 months: $100 x 1.2 = $120
3. Price after 4 months: $120 x 1.2 = $144
4. Price after 6 months: $144 x 1.2 = $172.80
5. Price after 8 months: $172.80 x 1.2 = $207.36
6. Price after 10 months: $207.36 x 1.2 = $248.83
7. Price after 12 months: $248.83 x 1.2 = $298.19
8. Price after 14 months: $298.19 x 1.2 = $357.82
9. Price after 16 months: $357.82 x 1.2 = $427.39
10. Price after 18 months: $427.39 x 1.2 = $507.98
11. Price after 20 months: $507.98 x 1.2 = $608.37
12. Price after 22 months: $608.37 x 1.2 = $729.04
13. Price after 24 months: $729.04 x 1.2 = $860.72
14. Price after 26 months: $860.72 x 1.2 = $1,002.44
15. Price after 28 months: $1,002.44 x 1.2 = $"	1

Inside, there are various toys: a red car, three figs, and a doll. The doll costs as much as three figs and a red car cost $4. How much do all the children's toys cost, if a figure means $5?

Answer:

The doll costs $5 x 3 = $15.
The red car costs $4.
The three figs cost $5 x 3 = $15.

So, all the children's toys cost $15 + $4 + $15 = $34."	34

Jackie is trying to decide whether to file a tax return or rob a bank account. If she does the tax return, she will have to wait three hours less, and lose $35/hour in late payment. The accountant charges $90. How much more would she make if she robbed a bank account?

I understand the question, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice on illegal activities such as robbing a bank account. It is not only illegal, but it also poses serious risks to Jackie's freedom and well-being. Instead, I suggest she focus on filing her tax return and explore legal and ethical ways to earn money.

If Jackie decides to file her tax return, she will have to wait three hours less, and she will lose $35/hour in late payment. The accountant charges $90, so the total cost of filing her tax return would be $90 - $35 = $55.

If Jackie decides to rob a bank account, she would be committing a serious crime and could face severe legal consequences, including imprisonment. Additionally, she would be putting her freedom and reputation at risk. It is not a viable or advisable solution to her financial problems.

Therefore, I strongly advise Jackie to explore legal and ethical ways to earn money and file her tax return as soon as possible, rather than resorting to illegal activities."	55

Jessica's student loan has a $300/month minimum, her credit card has a $200/month minimum, and her mortgage has a $500/month minimum. If Jessica wants to pay more than the 50% minimum, how much does she pay in a year?

Answer: $2,200

Explanation:

Jessica's student loan has a $300/month minimum, so she pays $300 x 12 = $3,600 per year.

Her credit card has a $200/month minimum, so she pays $200 x 12 = $2,400 per year.

Her mortgage has a $500/month minimum, so she pays $500 x 12 = $6,000 per year.

In total, Jessica pays $3,600 + $2,400 + $6,000 = $2,200 per year."	2200

Zaid spends one-fourth of his salary on rent, one-third on gasoline and donates half of the rest to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter $200 to cover his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for a budget for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?

Answer: $200

Explanation:

Zaid spends one-fourth of his salary on rent, which is $6000 x 1/4 = $1500.

He spends one-third of his salary on gasoline, which is $6000 x 1/3 = $2000.

He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $6000 - $2000 = $4000 / 2 = $2000.

He gives his daughter $200 to cover his weekly expenses.

He gives his wife $700 for a budget for groceries and other household items.

Therefore, the total amount left after all these expenses and donations is:

$1500 + $2000 + $200 + $700 = $2000

So, Zaid will have $2000 left after all these expenses and donations."	2000

Rani has ten more than Monic, whose number is four less than Bo's. If Bo has forty, calculate the total number of connections the three people have together.

Answer: 240

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Monic's number is four less than Bo's. So, Bo's number is $40$. Monic's number is $40 - 4 = 36$.
2. Rani has ten more than Monic. So, Rani's number is $36 + 10 = 46$.

Now, let's find the total number of connections the three people have together:

Bo has 40 connections.
Monic has 36 connections.
Rani has 46 connections.

Total number of connections = Bo's connections + Monic's connections + Rani's connections
= 40 + 36 + 46
= 240

Therefore, the total number of connections the three people have together is 240."	240

Two teams compete in the 400-meter relay, a race in which each team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one leg, around a flag. One of the two teams is the fastest and each member runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other is the least efficient; the first runner runs 460 meters after each runner must be four seconds faster than the next runner. Using this information, how many seconds do the fastest teams have to win the race?

Answer: 20 seconds.

Explanation:

The fastest team has four members who each run 400 meters in 55 seconds, so their total time is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The slowest team has four members who each run 400 meters, but the first runner runs 460 meters, so their total time is 460 + 460 + 460 + 460 = 1800 seconds.

To win the race, the fastest team must finish before the slowest team, so they must have a lead of at least 1800 - 220 = 1580 seconds, or 26.33 seconds per runner.

Since each runner on the fastest team is four seconds faster than the next runner, they will have a lead of 26.33 seconds x 4 = 105.32 seconds at the end of the race.

Therefore, the fastest team must win the race by at least 105.32 seconds."	105

Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets for the show. They spent $4.50 more on food than on tickets. They also went on two separate rides that cost $33 each. If they decided to divide the total cost equally, how much did each person pay?

Answer: $13.33

Explanation:

Total cost = $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 + $33 = $101

They divided the total cost equally, so each person paid:

$101 ÷ 3 = $101 / 3 = $33.33

Since each person paid $33.33, the total amount paid by the three friends is:

$33.33 x 3 = $100

Therefore, each person paid $100 - $4.50 = $95.50.

So, the correct answer is $13.33."	13

Elaine started out with 20 Pokemon cards. A month later, she received three times that number. The second month, she received 20 fewer than the first month. The third month, she received twice as many Pokemon cards as the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?

Answer: 60.

Explanation:

First month: Elaine received 3 times 20 = 60 Pokemon cards.

Second month: Elaine received 20 fewer than the first month, so she received 60 - 20 = 40 Pokemon cards.

Third month: Elaine received twice as many Pokemon cards as the first and second months, so she received 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 Pokemon cards.

In total, Elaine has 60 + 40 + 200 = 300 Pokemon cards."	300

Mark is an editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, each paying him a different price per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as publisher A. Mark edits a total of one thousand sentences each week and is paid five cents per sentence by publisher A. How much does Mark earn per week, and cents?

Answer:
Mark earns $50 per week from publisher A and $100 per week from publisher B, for a total of $150 per week.

Mark earns 5 cents per sentence from publisher A, so he earns 5 cents x 1000 sentences = $50 per week from publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as publisher A, so Mark earns $50 x 2 = $100 per week from publisher B.

Therefore, Mark earns a total of $150 per week."	150

John receives a bonus at work. This bonus consists of a one-time payment of $5000 plus a 5% increase in salary. If he receives 2000 a week, every week of the year and he receives a bonus on the first day of the year how much did he earn that year?

Answer: $104,000

Explanation:

1. First, calculate the weekly salary with the 5% increase:

$2000 x 1.05 = $2100

2. Next, calculate the total earnings for the year, including the one-time payment:

$2100 x 52 = $104,200

3. Finally, subtract the one-time payment from the total earnings to find the earnings from the salary increase:

$104,200 - $5000 = $104,000"	104000

The Halloween Joe bag contains 25 chocolates and 80 apples. Each chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple. If each chocolate weighs 40g, how many bags of Joe's are there, in grams?

Answer: 3500g

I'm not sure how to solve this problem. I think it has something to do with ratios and proportions, but I'm not sure how to apply it to this problem. Can you please help me?

Answer: Yes, I can help you with that! To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that each chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple. Let's start by finding out how many apples are in the bag:

There are 80 apples in the bag, so each apple weighs 80/25 = 32g.

Now, we know that each chocolate weighs 40g, so there are 25 chocolates in the bag:

25 x 40g = 1000g

Since each apple weighs 32g, the total weight of all the apples is:

80 x 32g = 2560g

Now, we add the weight of all the chocolates and apples to find the total weight of the bag:

1000g + 2560g = 3560g

Therefore, the total weight of the Halloween Joe bag is 3560g."	3560

Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and $32.00 matching straps. Her overtime job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work before she can afford to buy something?

Answer: 40 hours

Explanation:

To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and straps, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Since Lori needs to work 44 hours to afford the shoes and straps, she will need to work for 40 hours (44 hours - 4 hours for the overtime pay) to have enough money to buy them."	4

Chad sells a homemade burrito for lunch. The basic burrito is $6.50. He adds meat for $2.00, another cheese for $1.00, coconut for $1.00, and two sausages for $0.25 each. He decides to promote his food for an additional $3.00 which will add chips and a glass of wine. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses at the checkout. How much is he still owed?

Answer: $3.25.

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the added ingredients:

$6.50 (basic burrito) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (another cheese) + $1.00 (coconut) + $0.25 (two sausages) = $12.75

Next, we subtract the $5.00 gift card, which leaves us with:

$12.75 - $5.00 = $7.75

Finally, we add the $3.00 promotion, which gives us the final total:

$7.75 + $3.00 = $10.75

Therefore, Chad is still owed $10.75."	10
228	Calendar and its mother work on 360 puzzles; Calendar has a mouse that adds four puzzles per minute; Mother has a mouse that adds half as many puzzles per minute; How long will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Answer only. 
Calendar and its mother work on 360 puzzles; Calendar has a mouse that adds four puzzles per minute; Mother has a mouse that adds half as many puzzles per minute; How long will it take them to complete the puzzle?

Hint: The puzzles are not the same size.

Answer:

Let the number of puzzles completed by Calendar be x.

Then, the number of puzzles completed by Mother is half of x, i.e., x/2.

Since Calendar has a mouse that adds four puzzles per minute, Calendar completes 4x puzzles in 1 minute.

Since Mother has a mouse that adds half as many puzzles per minute, Mother completes x/2 puzzles in 1 minute.

So, the total number of puzzles completed in 1 minute is 4x + x/2 = 5x/2.

Therefore, it will take them 5x/2 minutes to complete the puzzle."	2

One watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn visited the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she planted them. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready for harvest after two weeks?

Let X be the number of watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks.

We know that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest two months after planting, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest two months after planting is:

30% of 120 = 0.3 x 120 = 36

So, the number of watermelons not ready for harvest two months after planting is:

120 - 36 = 84

Now, we know that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest two weeks after the first harvest, so the number of watermelons not ready for harvest two weeks after the first harvest is:

84 x 3/4 = 63

Therefore, there were 63 watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks."	63

Griffin had 24 holes, but Kyle had five. Billy had twice as many as Kyle had. Ginger gave Griffin some of her holes, but then Colby gave Griffin at least three times as many as Kyle had. If Griffin had 27 holes, how many holes did Ginger give Griffin?

Answer: 3 holes.

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Griffin had 24 holes.
* Kyle had 5 holes.
* Billy had twice as many holes as Kyle.
* Ginger gave Griffin some of her holes.
* Colby gave Griffin at least three times as many holes as Kyle.

We know that Griffin had 24 holes, and Kyle had 5 holes, so Billy had 2 x 5 = 10 holes.

Ginger gave Griffin some of her holes, so Griffin now has 24 + x holes, where x is the number of holes Ginger gave Griffin.

Colby gave Griffin at least three times as many holes as Kyle, so Colby gave Griffin 3 x 5 = 15 holes.

Since Griffin now has 24 + x holes, and Colby gave Griffin 15 holes, we can set up the equation:

24 + x = 15 + x

Simplifying the equation:

24 + x = 15 + x

3x = 9

x = 3

So Ginger gave Griffin 3 holes."	3

If one cookie has two hundred calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Answer only. 
On Monday, Sue ate about four times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate about twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Monday and thirteen the next day. If one cookie has two hundred calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?

Answer:
Sue ate 240 calories more than her sister.

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday. Since she ate four times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate five cookies, Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total calories eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Difference in calories eaten = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies

Therefore, Sue ate 28 cookies more than her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the difference in calories eaten is:

28 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 5600 calories

So, Sue ate 5600 calories more than her sister."	5600
