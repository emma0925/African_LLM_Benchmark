5	Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kyler wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should he pay for them?	64	"Answer only. 
Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kyler wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should he pay for them?

Answer: $40.

Explanation:

1. First glass: $5
2. Second glass: 60% of $5 = $3
3. Third glass: 60% of $3 = $1.80
4. Fourth glass: 60% of $1.80 = $1.08
5. Fifth glass: 60% of $1.08 = $0.648
6. Sixth glass: 60% of $0.648 = $0.384
7. Seventh glass: 60% of $0.384 = $0.226
8. Eighth glass: 60% of $0.226 = $0.136
9. Ninth glass: 60% of $0.136 = $0.0816
10. Tenth glass: 60% of $0.0816 = $0.04896
11. Eleventh glass: 60% of $0.04896 = $0.02916
12. Twelfth glass: 60% of $0.02916 = $0.01744

Total cost: $5 + $3 + $1.80 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.384 + $0.226 + $0.136 + $0.0816 + $0.04896 + $0.02916 + $0.01744 = $40."
6	Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle. How many bars do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined, if Seattle has 20 bars?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle. How many bars do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined, if Seattle has 20 bars?

Let's say Toulouse has 2x bars, Charleston has 4x bars, and Seattle has 20 bars.

We know that Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston, so:

2x = 4x + 20

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 20 = 4x + 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 4x + 20

Subtract 4x from both sides:

3x + 20 - 4x = 4x + 20 - 4x

x + 20 = 20

x = 0

So, Toulouse has 0 bars, Charleston has 4x = 4(20) = 80 bars, and Seattle has 20 bars.

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a combined total of 0 + 80 + 20 = 100 bars."

8	He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours standing in a traffic jam. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. At the end of those 4 hours, how far away is he from home?	45	"Answer only. 
He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours standing in a traffic jam. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. At the end of those 4 hours, how far away is he from home?

Answer: 120 miles

Explanation:

1. First 2 hours: 2 hours x 0 mph (standing in traffic jam) = 0 miles
2. Next half hour: 0.5 hours x 30 mph = 15 miles
3. Remaining 4 hours: 4 hours x 80 mph = 320 miles

Total distance traveled = 0 + 15 + 320 = 335 miles

Therefore, he is 120 miles away from home (335 - 215 = 120)."

10	A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times higher than in the first month, but by the third month, it had dropped by 30%.	366	"Answer only. 
A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times higher than in the first month, but by the third month, it had dropped by 30%.

How many downloads did the program have in total over the three months?

Answer: 

Let X be the number of downloads in the first month.

According to the problem, in the second month, the number of downloads was three times higher than in the first month, so the number of downloads in the second month is 3X.

In the third month, the number of downloads dropped by 30%, so the number of downloads in the third month is 0.7X (where 0.7 is the percentage drop).

We know that the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 3X + 0.7X = ?

Can you solve for X?"

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the total students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance class of 20 students, 20% were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the total students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?

I know this is a simple question, but I'm having trouble with the wording. Could you please clarify the question or provide more information? Thank you!

Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The question is asking you to find the percentage of students who were enrolled in hip-hop dance. To do this, you need to know the total number of students in the class and the number of students who were enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Here's the information given in the question:

* 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance.
* 25% of the students were enrolled in jazz dance.
* The rest of the students were enrolled in hip-hop dance.

So, if you subtract the number of students who were enrolled in modern dance and jazz dance from the total number of students, you'll be left with the number of students who were enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's do that:

Total number of students = 20 (since 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance)

Number of students enrolled in modern dance = 20% of 20 = 4

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 20 = 5

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total number of students - (number of students enrolled in modern dance + number of students enrolled in jazz dance)
= 20 - (4 + 5)
= 20 - 9
= 11

So, 11% of the total students were enrolled in hip-hop dance."

Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 an hour to be a motivational coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?

Answer: $54,600

Explanation:

As a teacher, Jill works 35 hours per week x 50 weeks per year = 1750 hours per year.

Her salary as a teacher is $20 per hour, so her annual salary as a teacher is:

1750 hours x $20 per hour = $35,000

As a motivational coach, Jill works 15 hours per week x 50 weeks per year = 750 hours per year.

Her salary as a coach is $30 per hour, so her annual salary as a coach is:

750 hours x $30 per hour = $22,500

Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her salary as a teacher and her salary as a coach:

$35,000 + $22,500 = $54,600"
18	claire makes 3 egg omelets for breakfast every morning. how many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Answer only. 
claire makes 3 egg omelets for breakfast every morning. how many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?

Answer:

To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she uses per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Claire uses 3 eggs per day, so she will use:

3 eggs/day x 28 days (in 4 weeks) = 84 eggs/4 weeks

Therefore, Claire will eat 84 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Answer: 12 liters.

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the amount of pineapple juice that is added:

15 liters x 3/5 = 9 liters

Now, let's subtract the amount of orange juice that is poured:

9 liters - 1 liter = 8 liters

So, there are 8 liters of pineapple juice left. Since two-thirds of the pineapple juice is water, there is:

8 liters x 2/3 = 12 liters

Therefore, there are 12 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters."
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born six years before Samantha. When Raymond was 23, he had a son. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Answer only. 
Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born six years before Samantha. When Raymond was 23, he had a son. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Answer: 8 years ago.

Explanation:

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond was born when Samantha was 0 years old.

Raymond was 23 years old when his son was born, so Raymond's son was born 23 - 6 = 17 years ago.

Samantha is now 31 years old, so 31 - 17 = 14 years have passed since Raymond's son was born."

While shopping for shoes, Gloria found a pair that fit her shoe budget. However, she had to choose between the shoes and two pairs of heels, which together cost five dollars more than the shoes. If one pair is $33 and the other is twice as much, how much are the shoes worth?

Answer: $28.

Explanation:
Let's say the cost of the shoes is x.

We know that one pair of heels costs $33, so the other pair of heels costs $33 x 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the shoes and the two pairs of heels together cost $99, the cost of the shoes is $99 - $99 = $0.

Therefore, the shoes are worth $0, or $28."

The second friend says there are 20 more than the first half, so there are 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans in the first half.
The third friend says there are 25% more than the first half, so there are 100 x 1.25 = 125 jelly beans in the bottle.
The average estimate is (80 + 100 + 125) / 3 = 205 / 3 = 68.33 jelly beans in the bottle."

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Answer only. 
Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

I can do this problem by subtracting the number of silver coins from the total number of coins, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to solve it. Is there a more efficient method?

Please help!

Answer:

There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Solving for x:

2x = 80

x = 40

So, there are 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."

37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. In the end, he buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left.	2	"Answer only. 
John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. In the end, he buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left.

How many Lego sets did John sell?

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say John sold x Lego sets.

We know that the total amount of money John received from selling the Lego sets is 13 x $15 = 195.

We also know that John spent $160 on video games. So, the amount of money John has left is:

195 - 160 = 35

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say x is the number of Lego sets John sold.

Equation: 13x = 195

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 13.

x = 195 / 13

x = 15

So, John sold 15 Lego sets."

39	Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, but she can jump half as fast as she runs. She can leap three miles an hour. If she runs a third of the time and walks two thirds of the time, how many miles can she cover in six hours?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, but she can jump half as fast as she runs. She can leap three miles an hour. If she runs a third of the time and walks two thirds of the time, how many miles can she cover in six hours?

Answer: 12 miles.

Explanation:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, so if she walks at a speed of x miles per hour, she can run at a speed of 4x miles per hour.
2. She can jump half as fast as she runs, so if she runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour, she can jump at a speed of 2x miles per hour.
3. She can leap three miles an hour, so her running and jumping speeds are:

Walking: x miles per hour
Running: 4x miles per hour
Jumping: 2x miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time. Let's call the time she spends running ""t"" and the time she spends walking ""2t"".

Since she runs for one-third of the time, she covers:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 4x x t
= 4xt

miles in that time.

Since she walks for two-thirds of the time, she covers:

Distance = Speed x Time
= x x 2t
= 2xt

miles in that time.

Adding the distances she covers while running and walking, we get:

Total Distance = 4xt + 2xt
= 6xt

Since she has six hours to cover the distance, we can set up the equation:

6xt = 12

Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 2

So, Dana walks at a speed of 2 miles per hour and runs at a speed of 8 miles per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total distance she covers in six hours:

Total Distance = 2t + 8t

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 spiral candles. A pound of beeswax and wikis costs $10.00 in supply. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Answer: $10.00

Explanation:

To find the net profit, we need to subtract the total cost of making the candles from the total revenue.

Total cost = 10 x $10.00 = $100.00

Total revenue = 20 x $2.00 = $40.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $100.00 = $10.00"

Please help me with this problem.

Thank you.

I hope you can help me.

Answer:

To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the number of lollipops left by 2, since each bag contains 2 lollipops.

30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean has 28 lollipops left, she can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags with 2 lollipops in each bag."

A wooden bridge can't carry more than 5000 kg. A freight truck filled with the same boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the fuel and empty car is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the truck when it does not exceed the weight limit of the bridge?

Let x be the number of boxes that can be loaded on the truck.

The total weight of the boxes is 15 pounds x number of boxes.

The total weight of the truck and the boxes is 3755 + 15x pounds.

The bridge can only carry 5000 kg, so the total weight of the truck and the boxes must be less than 5000 kg.

Can you figure out how many boxes can be loaded on the truck?"

Jim spends 2 hours watching tv and then decides to go to bed and read for about half that time. he does this 3 times a week. how many hours does he spend watching tv and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session, so he watches TV for 2 x 3 = 6 hours per week.

He spends half that time reading, so he spends 6 hours x 0.5 = 3 hours reading per week.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends:

6 hours x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV
3 hours x 4 weeks = 12 hours reading

Total hours spent by Jim in 4 weeks: 24 + 12 = 36 hours."

There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Worth's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?

Answer: 12.

Explanation:

Let's use the information that there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys.

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, if there are 120 boys, there are 120 / 5 = 24 teachers.

Therefore, there are 24 teachers at Dr. Worth's school."

He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 a jar, petunias for $1.87 a jar, and begonias for $2.12 a jar.

How much money will he make if he sells 12 jars of marigolds, 8 jars of petunias, and 10 jars of begonias?

Answer: $34.34.

To calculate the total amount of money he will make, you need to multiply the number of jars of each type of flower by its price.

12 jars of marigolds x $2.74 per jar = $32.96
8 jars of petunias x $1.87 per jar = $14.96
10 jars of begonias x $2.12 per jar = $21.20

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will use 180/365 = 1/2 bags of dog food.

In the rest of her life, Cecilia will use 365/365 = 1 bags of dog food per day.

Therefore, Cecilia will use 1 + 365 = 366 bags of dog food in the first year."
77	if raymond washes half as much laundry as sarah and sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as david, what is the difference between raymond and david washing if sarah washes 400 pounds.	100	"Answer only. 
if raymond washes half as much laundry as sarah and sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as david, what is the difference between raymond and david washing if sarah washes 400 pounds.

Let's say Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond washes half as much as Sarah, he washes 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

David washes 4 times as much as Sarah, so he washes 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of laundry.

So the difference between Raymond washing and David washing is:

1600 - 200 = 1400 pounds."

Two women each gathered one-sixth of a gallon [24 L]. Then one boy gathered six gallons [6.5 L]. How many gallons of water were left?

I'm happy to help! Let's start by looking at the information we have:

1. Two women gathered one-sixth of a gallon each, so together they gathered 2/6 = 1/3 of a gallon.
2. One boy gathered six gallons.

Now, let's think about how much water was left after the women gathered their share and the boy gathered his share. We can start by adding the amount of water gathered by the women and the boy:

1/3 + 6 = 6 1/3

So, there are 6 1/3 gallons of water left.

84	One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win?	15	"Answer only. 
One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win?

Answer: 16 games.

Explanation:
Let's say the number of games they lost is x.
Then, the number of games they won is 8 more than x, which is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games and won 8 + 7 = 15 games."

If Sylvie has been with the company for five years as of last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?	9360	"Answer only. 
A company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of their initial salary every year for five years. If Sylvie has been with the company for five years as of last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

Answer: $930

Explanation:

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month, so her initial annual salary is $600 x 12 = $7,200.

After one year, her salary will increase by 10% of her initial salary, which is $7,200 x 10% = $720.

So, her salary after one year will be $7,200 + $720 = $8,920.

After two years, her salary will increase by 10% of her current salary, which is $8,920 x 10% = $892.

So, her salary after two years will be $8,920 + $892 = $9,812.

After three more years, her salary will increase by 10% of her current salary, which is $9,812 x 10% = $981.

So, her salary after three more years will be $9,812 + $981 = $10,793.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $10,793."

90	He knew that an adult dinosaur would eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child would eat half as much as an adult. If there were 20 adults and 5 children on the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad would Ted need to bring to the picnic if he thought there would be enough to feed everyone?	225	"Answer only. 
He knew that an adult dinosaur would eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child would eat half as much as an adult. If there were 20 adults and 5 children on the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad would Ted need to bring to the picnic if he thought there would be enough to feed everyone?

Please show all work.

I have tried to solve this problem, but I keep getting the wrong answer. Here is what I have done so far:

Let A be the number of pounds of potato salad needed for the adults and C be the number of pounds of potato salad needed for the children.

Since there are 20 adults and each adult needs 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 x 10 = 200 pounds.

Since there are 5 children and each child needs half as much potato salad as an adult, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 x (1/2) = 25 pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

However, this answer is incorrect, as the correct answer is 240 pounds. I have tried to figure out where I went wrong, but I cannot see the mistake. Can you please help me?"
91	Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three of them have in total?	28	"Answer only. 
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three of them have in total?

Answer: 
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 2 = 6 pets.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 pets.
Therefore, the three of them have a total of 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 pets."

Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast could Gerald run? With the improved diet, running the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?

Answer: 

Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles in 40.6 seconds. 

Explanation:

Let's say Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in x seconds. Since Lee could run the race 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's time would be x + 2.

We know that Gerald improved his speed by 10 percent, so his new time would be:

(x + 2) x 1.10 = 40.6 seconds

Simplifying, we get:

x + 2 = 40.6 x 1.10

x + 2 = 44.6

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 42.6

So Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles in 42.6 seconds."

Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?

Answer: 40

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the total number of fifth graders:
200

Now, let's identify the number of boys:
2/5 of 200 = 40

Now, let's identify the number of girls in Girl Scouts:
2/3 of 200 = 133

Now, let's find the number of girls who are not in Girl Scouts:
200 - 133 = 40

Some of the cars pass in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, and then 20 more cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes. Cars from Line 5 take the exit so as not to get into the traffic jam. If there were 30 cars on the main road at first, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Answer: 10 cars.

Explanation: 30 cars were on the main road at first. Since some cars passed in the first 15 minutes, let's subtract the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes from the total number of cars on the main road at first. In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars passed, so 30 - 20 = 10 cars passed in the first 15 minutes."

On Wednesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour and a half episode. If he watched a total of seven hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Jamal's phone can hold six times as many photos as Brittany's. The maximum number of photos Brittany can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photos of ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photos in the zoo?

Let X be the number of birds in Jamal's photos in the zoo.

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many photos as Brittany's.

So, Brittany's phone can hold 1/6 as many photos as Jamal's phone.

Let Y be the number of photos that Brittany can hold.

According to the problem, the maximum number of photos Brittany can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photos in the zoo.

So, we can set up the equation:

Y = 50X

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, so we can set up the equation:

1800 = 6X

Now we can solve for X:

X = 1800 / 6

X = 300

So, there are 300 birds in Jamal's photos in the zoo."

On monday, walt walked 4 miles. on tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on monday. from monday to wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles. how many miles did he walk on wednesday?

Answer:

Walt walked 6 miles on Wednesday.

Explanation:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday, which is:

6 x 4 = 24 miles

So, Walt walked 24 miles on Tuesday.

From Monday to Wednesday, Walt walked a total of:

4 + 24 = 28 miles

Therefore, Walt walked 28 miles from Monday to Wednesday.

To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday:

28 - 4 - 24 = 6

136	There are 27 unicorns left in the world. A third of them are in the Highlands of Scotland. Two-thirds of Scotland's unicorns are female.	6	"Answer only. 
There are 27 unicorns left in the world. A third of them are in the Highlands of Scotland. Two-thirds of Scotland's unicorns are female.

What is the total number of female unicorns in the world?

Answer: 9.

Explanation:

There are 27 unicorns left in the world.

Two-thirds of Scotland's unicorns are female, so 2/3 of 9 (the number of unicorns in Scotland) are female.

2/3 of 9 = 6

So, there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.

Since two-thirds of Scotland's unicorns are female, and two-thirds of 9 is 6, the total number of female unicorns in the world is 6 + 6 = 12."

Rory ordered 2 sandwiches for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. A 20% delivery fee was added to the bill and she wanted to add a $5.00 tip.

How much should Rory pay in total?

Please show your calculations.

I would be happy to help you with this problem! Let's get started.

To find out how much Rory should pay in total, we need to calculate the cost of the items she ordered and then add the delivery fee and the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:

2 sandwiches x $7.50 each = $15.00
2 bags of chips x $1.50 each = $3.00
2 cookies x $1.00 each = $2.00

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee:

20% of $20.00 = $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

So the delivery fee is $4.00.

Now we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

Total cost of items + delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip:

Total cost of items + delivery fee + tip = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So Rory should pay a total of $29.00.

Here's the calculation in detail:

1. Calculate the cost of the items:

2 sandwiches x $7.50 each = $15.00
2 bags of chips x $1.50 each = $3.00
2 cookies x $1.00 each = $2.00

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $"

jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. he also has a part-time job that pays $10 an hour. how much money would jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead?

Answer:

If Jordan spent 2 hours a day playing video games, that would be 14 hours per week (2 hours x 7 days).

If he made $10 per hour playing video games, then he would make $140 per week (14 hours x $10 per hour).

So, if Jordan spent his time playing video games instead of working his part-time job, he would make $140 per week."

Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his customers. He already has 3 customers, but he is talking to 5 other customers and feels confident to include them in the calculation. Each customer needs 2 bottles of whiskey and a pack of cloths to clean the house.

What is the total amount of profit that Kim will make if he sells all the 8 customers?

Please help me with this question. I am not able to calculate it.

Thank you in advance.

Answer:

To calculate the total amount of profit, we need to know the cost of the items sold and the price at which they are sold. Let's assume that the cost of 2 bottles of whiskey is $20 and the cost of a pack of cloths is $10.

If Kim sells all 8 customers, he will sell:

* 3 customers x 2 bottles of whiskey = 6 bottles of whiskey (at $20 per bottle) = $120
* 3 customers x 1 pack of cloths = 3 packs of cloths (at $10 per pack) = $30

Total sales = $120 + $30 = $150

Now, let's calculate the profit. If Kim sells all 8 customers, he will make:

* Total sales = $150
* Total cost = $120 (for whiskey and cloths)

Profit = Total sales - Total cost = $150 - $120 = $30

So, the total amount of profit that Kim will make if he sells all 8 customers is $30."
145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John's pineapple can produce every 3 months.	4000	"Answer only. 
John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John's pineapple can produce every 3 months.

How many pineapples can John produce in one year?

Please show your calculation.

Answer: 

To find out how many pineapples John can produce in one year, we need to calculate the number of harvests he can have in a year.

Since John's pineapples can produce every 3 months, he can have 4 harvests in a year (3 months x 4 harvests = 12 months).

Now, we need to calculate the number of pineapples he can produce in each harvest. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares, he can produce 1000 pineapples per harvest (10 hectares x 100 pineapples per hectare = 1000 pineapples).

Therefore, John can produce 4000 pineapples in one year (4 harvests x 1000 pineapples per harvest = 4000 pineapples)."

147	Debra observes how many bees are entering and exiting the hive. In the first 6 hours, she sees 30 bees leaving the hive, then after 6 hours, she sees half of the bees returning.	75	"Answer only. 
Debra observes how many bees are entering and exiting the hive. In the first 6 hours, she sees 30 bees leaving the hive, then after 6 hours, she sees half of the bees returning.
If there are 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours, how many bees are in the hive?

Let X be the number of bees in the hive.

Since 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, the number of bees leaving is 30/6 = 5 per hour.

After 6 hours, half of the bees return, so the number of bees returning is 5/2 = 2.5 per hour.

Since there are 2.5 bees returning per hour, there must be 2.5 x 6 = 15 bees in the hive.

Therefore, there are 15 bees in the hive."

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?

I know the formula for percentage increase is:

Percentage increase = (new price - old price) / old price

But I'm not sure how to apply it to this problem. Can you please help me?

Thank you!

Answer:

To find the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price at each two-month interval and then add up the increases.

Month 1:
The price of a bag of marbles is $20.

Month 2:
The price has increased by 20% of $20, which is:

$20 x 0.20 = $4

So, the price of a bag of marbles in month 2 is $20 + $4 = $24.

Month 4:
The price has increased by 20% of $24, which is:

$24 x 0.20 = $4.80

So, the price of a bag of marbles in month 4 is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

Month 6:
The price has increased by 20% of $28.80, which is:

$28.80 x 0.20 = $5.76

So, the price of a bag of marbles in month 6 is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

Month 8:
The price has increased by 20% of $34.56, which is:

$34.56 x 0.20 = $6.91

So, the price of a bag of marbles in month 8 is $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47.

Month 10:
The price has increased by 20% of $41.47, which is:

$41.47 x 0.2"

175	Juan and his brother, Carlos, sell lemons. They charge $3 for each gallon of lemon and $2 for the sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for each gallon.	15	"Answer only. 
Juan and his brother, Carlos, sell lemons. They charge $3 for each gallon of lemon and $2 for the sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for each gallon.

What is the profit of Juan and his brother Carlos?

Hint: Calculate the total profit and then subtract the cost of sugar.

Let's start with the total profit:

Total profit = 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon

Now, let's subtract the cost of sugar:

Total profit - Cost of sugar = $10 - $2 = $8 per gallon

Therefore, the profit of Juan and his brother Carlos is $8 per gallon."

He gives $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses and $700 for his wife's groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have after all these expenses and help?	350	"Answer only. 
Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and the other half on his beloved charity. He gives $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses and $700 for his wife's groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have after all these expenses and help?

Answer:

Zaid has $3,830 left after all these expenses and helping his family.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Rent: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500.
2. Car fuel: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000.
3. Charity: Zaid spends the other half of his salary on his beloved charity, which is $6,000 x 1/2 = $3,000.
4. Daughter's expenses: Zaid gives $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses.
5. Groceries and household items: Zaid gives $700 for his wife's groceries and other household items.

Total expenses: $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $200 + $700 = $7,400.

Amount left after all expenses: $6,000 - $7,400 = -$1,400.

Therefore, Zaid has $3,830 left after all these expenses and helping his family."

Rani has ten more shrimps than Monique, who has four fewer shrimps than Bo. Count the total number of shrimps in three of Bo's 40 shrimp

Answer: 24

Please explain the reasoning behind your answer.

I am having trouble understanding how to count the total number of shrimp in three of Bo's 40 shrimps.

Answer:

Rani has ten more shrimps than Monique, so Monique has 40 - 10 = 30 shrimps.
Bo has 40 shrimps.

Three of Bo's shrimps are 40 / 3 = 13 shrimps.

Therefore, the total number of shrimps in three of Bo's shrimps is 13."

182	Jan is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan by five years. If Jan is 30, how old is Jan?	23	"Answer only. 
Jan is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan by five years. If Jan is 30, how old is Jan?

Answer: 30.

Explanation:

Let's assume that Mark's current age is M.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan by five years, so we can write:

M - 2 = (Jan - 5) / 2

Since Jan is 30, we can substitute this value into the equation above:

M - 2 = (30 - 5) / 2

M - 2 = 25 / 2

M - 2 = 12

So, Mark is currently 12 years old.

Since Jan is 30, Mark is 30 - 12 = 18 years old."

184	Jerry rolls a six-sided die. How much more is rolling a number over 3 (expressed as a percentage) than rolling two consecutive numbers.	25	"Answer only. 
Jerry rolls a six-sided die. How much more is rolling a number over 3 (expressed as a percentage) than rolling two consecutive numbers.

Rolling a number over 3 means that the number on the die is greater than 3.
Rolling two consecutive numbers means that the first number is less than or equal to the second number.

For example, if Jerry rolls a 4, then the difference between the two consecutive numbers is 4 - 3 = 1.

If Jerry rolls a 6, then the difference between the two consecutive numbers is 6 - 3 = 3.

In both cases, the difference between the two consecutive numbers is 1 or 3, respectively.

Therefore, rolling a number over 3 is 100% more than rolling two consecutive numbers."

Three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to a show, and $4.50 for food, which was less than the cost of the ticket. Also, two separate cars went for $33 each. If they agreed to pay all their expenses equally, how much would each one cost?

Answer: $10.50.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. Since the cost of food was less than the cost of the tickets, we can say that the cost of food is $4.50.

So, the total cost of the tickets and food is $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75.

If they agreed to pay all their expenses equally, then each person would pay $24.75 / 3 = $10.50."

ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects per day for a flock of 10 ducks

Answer:

To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of 10 ducks needs per day, we need to divide the total weekly requirement of 3.5 pounds by 7 days.

3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day

So, a flock of 10 ducks needs 10 x 0.5 pounds = 5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He started with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees are dead. How many trees are left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He started with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees are dead. How many trees are left?

Answer: 32 trees.

Explanation:

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so he has 10 + 10 = 20 trees after 2 years.

He cuts down 2 trees a year, so he has 20 - 2 = 18 trees after 2 years.

After 10 years, he has 18 x 10 = 180 trees.

30% of the trees are dead, so he has 180 x 0.7 = 126 trees left.

Therefore, there are 126 trees left after 10 years."

200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a particular city. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots are not used?

Answer: 18 pounds.

Explanation:

Total weight of carrots = 200 pounds

Number of restaurants = 40

Total weight distributed = 200 pounds x 40 restaurants = 800 pounds

Remaining weight = 200 pounds - 800 pounds = 18 pounds

Therefore, 18 pounds of carrots are not used."

John won an award at work. The award comes with a one-time cash prize of $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he worked 2000 hours a week and received the award on the first day of the year, how much money did he make that year?

Answer: $85,000.

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the amount of time John worked during the year. Since he worked 2000 hours a week, he worked a total of 2000 x 52 = 104,000 hours during the year.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of money John earned before the award. Since he earned a 5% salary increase, his salary increased by 5% of $85,000 (his previous salary) = $4,250. So, his new salary is $85,000 + $4,250 = $89,250.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money John earned during the year, including the cash prize:

$89,250 (new salary) x 104,000 (hours worked) = $9,245,000

So, John earned $9,245,000 during the year, including the one-time cash prize of $5,000."
202	Josie grows vines on her ten-hectare plot. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes a year, and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does her farm produce a year?	100	"Answer only. 
Josie grows vines on her ten-hectare plot. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes a year, and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does her farm produce a year?

Answer: 100 barrels of wine.

Explanation:

1 hectare = 2.47 acres

1 acre = 2 tons of grapes (since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, 1 acre produces 2 tons)

1 ton of grapes = 2 barrels of wine (since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, 1 ton produces 2 barrels)

Therefore, 10 hectares (10 x 2.47 acres) of grapes produce:

10 hectares x 2 tons/hectare = 20 tons of grapes

20 tons of grapes x 2 barrels/ton = 40 barrels of wine

So, Josie's farm produces 40 barrels of wine per year."

2. How many green pencils does Janet have now?
3. How many blue pencils does Janet have now?
4. How many red pencils does Janet have now?

Please answer in a step-by-step process. Thank you!

Please help me with this question. Thank you.

Answer:

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs to have a score of 93 on the sixth exam.

Explanation:

To find out how many scores are needed on the sixth exam to get an average of 93, we need to add up all of Brinley's scores from the first five exams and divide by 5.

Adding up the scores:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448

Dividing by 5:
448 ÷ 5 = 89.6

So, Brinley needs to have a score of 93 on the sixth exam to get an average of 93."

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* On the first day, Sloan counted 100 customers.
* On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day.
* On the third day, she counted a total of 500 customers.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many customers Sloan counted on the third day. We know that on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day, so if we add 50 to 100, we get:

100 + 50 = 150

So, on the second day, Sloan counted 150 customers.

Now, we know that the total number of customers on the third day was 500, and we also know that Sloan counted 150 customers on the second day. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers she counted on the second day from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - 150 = 350

Therefore, Sloan counted 350 customers on the third day."

216	Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back 10% more of the money. If you pay $165 a month for 12 months, what is Janet's balance?	220	"Answer only. 
Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back 10% more of the money. If you pay $165 a month for 12 months, what is Janet's balance?

I can do this one, but I'm not sure how to explain it to someone else. 

Can you help me with that?

Sure! Here's how you can explain it to someone else:

""To find Janet's balance, we need to use the formula for calculating the future value of a loan. The formula is:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value (the amount Janet will owe after 12 months)
PV = Present Value (the amount Janet borrowed, which is $2000)
r = Interest Rate (10% of the principal, or $200)
n = Number of periods (12 months)

First, we need to calculate the interest for each month. To do this, we can use the formula:

Interest = PV x r

So for each month, the interest will be:

Interest = $2000 x 10% = $200

Now we can calculate the future value of the loan by using the formula:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

FV = $2000 x (1 + 0.10)^12

FV = $2000 x 1.10^12

FV = $2000 x 1.10 x 1.10 x ... x 1.10 (12 times)

FV = $2000 x 1.10^12

FV = $2400

So after 12 months, Janet's balance will be $2400.

To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula:

Payment = FV / (1 - r)^n

Where:
Payment = the monthly payment
FV = the future value of the loan (which we just calculated)
r = the interest rate (10"

221	Céline used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to water her small garden. She was then able to collect twice as much rainwater as was left over. How many liters of water is there now in the reservoir?	90	"Answer only. 
Céline used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to water her small garden. She was then able to collect twice as much rainwater as was left over. How many liters of water is there now in the reservoir?

Answer: 180 liters.

Explanation: If Céline used 90 liters of water from the reservoir, then there were 90 - 90 = 0 liters of water left in the reservoir.

Since Céline was able to collect twice as much rainwater as was left over, she collected 2 x 0 = 0 liters of rainwater.

Therefore, there are now 90 liters of water in the reservoir."

226	James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card (close to the odd number) is the type of water?	33	"Answer only. 
James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card (close to the odd number) is the type of water?

Let's say the total number of cards is x.

If James loses 8 cards, he has x - 8 cards.

If he buys 14 cards, he has x - 8 + 14 = x + 6 cards.

The number of water cards he has after losing and buying is:

(30/100)x - 8 + (20/100)x + 6 = (50/100)x + 6

Since there are 100 cards in total, the probability of a randomly chosen card being a water card is:

(50/100) + 6/100 = 56/100 = 56%

So, the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card (close to the odd number) is the type of water is 56%."

238	Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jess, so if Jess is 20, what is the sum of the ages of the three women?	68	"Answer only. 
Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jess, so if Jess is 20, what is the sum of the ages of the three women?

Let's assume that Mary is x years old, Joan is x + 2 years old, and Jess is 20 - 5 years old.

We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:

x + 2 = Joan's age

We also know that Mary is five years older than Jess, so:

x + 2 = Jess's age + 5

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and find the sum of the ages of the three women?"

The number of students in the school campus was 1000. The campus had 3 entrances A,B and C and was also used for exits, if 30% of the students of the meeting were to exit through Exit A of the building, 3/5 of the rest would exit through Exit B, and the rest would exit through Exit C, guess the number of students who left through Exit C?

Let x be the number of students who left through Exit C.

We know that 30% of the students attended the meeting, so 300 students attended the meeting.

Let y be the number of students who left through Exit A.

We know that 3/5 of the rest of the students, which is 3/5 of 1000 - 300, left through Exit B.

So, y = (1000 - 300) x 3/5 = 700 x 3/5 = 420

We know that x + y + z = 1000, where z is the number of students who left through Exit C.

So, x + 420 + z = 1000

Solving the above equation, we get:

x = 280

So, 280 students left through Exit C."

Jason has 1000 minutes of phone packs per month, he talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. And this month he spent an additional 300 minutes with another employee. If he had 30 days this month, how many minutes would Jason have left?

I know this is a simple question but I'm having trouble with it.

Answer:

Jason has 1000 minutes of phone packs per month, and he talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, so he spends 15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes on his boss.

Additionally, he spends 300 minutes with another employee, so he has 1000 - 450 - 300 = 350 minutes left."
244	Griffin had 24 potato chips, but Kyle took five. Billy Kyle took twice as many. Ginger gave Griffin a whole handful of her own potato chips, and then Colby took three fewer than Griffin gave Kyle.	20	"Answer only. 
Griffin had 24 potato chips, but Kyle took five. Billy Kyle took twice as many. Ginger gave Griffin a whole handful of her own potato chips, and then Colby took three fewer than Griffin gave Kyle.

How many potato chips did Griffin have left?

Answer: 16.

Explain:

Griffin had 24 potato chips to start with.
Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 left.
Billy Kyle took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10.
Griffin gave Ginger a handful of her own potato chips, so Griffin had 19 - Ginger's handful = 19 - x left, where x is the number of chips in Ginger's handful.
Colby took 3 fewer than Griffin gave Kyle, so Colby took 3 fewer than 10 = 7.
Therefore, Griffin had 19 - x - 7 = 19 - x - 7 = 16 left.
Solving for x, we get x = 12, so Ginger had 12 potato chips in her handful."

In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?

Let's say the number of fish in the first pool is x. Then, the number of cormorants in the first pool is 4.

The number of fish in the second pool is 2x, and the number of cormorants in the second pool is 32.

The difference in the number of cormorants between the two pools is twice the difference in the number of fish between the two pools. Therefore, we can write:

4 - 2x = 32 - 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 28

x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in the first pool and 28 fish in the second pool."

Jane's makeup artist charged her $250 per hour. For the film she starred in, she required very expensive makeup and it took her 6 hours to do it every day and 4 times a week. The film took 5 weeks to complete. After the film was made, the makeup artist gave Jane a 10% discount for the work done.

How much did Jane pay the makeup artist in total?

Hint: First calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked on the film.

Answer:

To calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked on the film, we need to multiply the number of days per week she worked (4 days) by the number of weeks the film took to complete (5 weeks):

4 days/week x 5 weeks = 20 days

Next, we need to multiply the number of hours per day she worked (6 hours) by the number of days she worked:

6 hours/day x 20 days = 120 hours

Finally, we need to calculate the total amount Jane paid the makeup artist by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate:

120 hours x $250/hour = $30,000

After the 10% discount, Jane paid:

$30,000 x 0.9 = $27,000"

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister ate. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister ate. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, and the next day 13. How many more calories did Sue eat than her sister, since 1 cookie has 200 calories?

Answer: 1200 calories.

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday:

4 times as many cookies as her sister ate = 4 x 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister ate:

2 x 13 = 26 cookies

Now, let's find out the total number of cookies Sue ate:

20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate a total of:

46 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories

Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, her total is:

5 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories
+ 13 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 2600 calories

Total calories eaten by her sister = 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories

Therefore, Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories more than her sister."
