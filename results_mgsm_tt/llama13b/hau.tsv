Janet's aunt makes 16 eggs a day. She makes three for breakfast every morning, and then she makes four for her friends every day. She sells the leftovers at the farmer's market every day for $2 per egg. How much money does she make a day at the farmer's market?

Answer: $8 per day.

Explanation:

* Janet's aunt makes 16 eggs a day (16 - 3 = 13).
* She sells 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.
* She sells 4 eggs to her friends every day, so she has 10 - 4 = 6 eggs left.
* She sells 6 eggs at the farmer's market for $2 per egg, so she makes $6 x $2 = $8 per day."

Josh decided to try the real estate business. He bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 to renovate the house. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

Answer: $120,000.

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the value of the house after renovation:

Value of the house after renovation = $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

So, Josh made a profit of $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000."

4	Every day Wendi feeds three cups of raw chicken feed, containing seeds, protein and vegetables for good health. She feeds the chickens three times. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens 25 cups. How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Answer only. 
Every day Wendi feeds three cups of raw chicken feed, containing seeds, protein and vegetables for good health. She feeds the chickens three times. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens 25 cups. How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Please show your work and explain.

Answer: 

To determine the total number of cups of food needed to feed Wendi's flock of 20 chickens at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of cups of food fed to the chickens in the morning and afternoon and add them together.

In the morning, Wendi feeds 15 cups of raw chicken feed to her flock of 20 chickens, so each chicken receives:

15 cups / 20 chickens = 0.75 cups per chicken

In the afternoon, Wendi feeds 25 cups of raw chicken feed to her flock of 20 chickens, so each chicken receives:

25 cups / 20 chickens = 1.25 cups per chicken

To find the total number of cups of food needed to feed the chickens at the end of the day, we add the number of cups fed in the morning and afternoon:

0.75 cups per chicken (morning) + 1.25 cups per chicken (afternoon) = 2 cups per chicken

Since there are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock, the total number of cups of food needed to feed her chickens at the end of the day is:

2 cups per chicken x 20 chickens = 40 cups

Therefore, it takes 40 cups of food to feed Wendi's flock of 20 chickens at the end of the day."
5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each subsequent glass is only 60% off its price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for the glasses?	64	"Answer only. 
Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each subsequent glass is only 60% off its price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for the glasses?

Answer:

Kylar needs to pay $120 for the 16 glasses.

Explanation:

The first glass costs $5, so the total cost for the first glass is $5.

For the second glass, the price is 60% off the original price, so the price of the second glass is $5 x 0.6 = $3.

For the third glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the third glass is $3 x 0.6 = $1.80.

For the fourth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the fourth glass is $1.80 x 0.6 = $1.08.

For the fifth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the fifth glass is $1.08 x 0.6 = $0.648.

For the sixth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the sixth glass is $0.648 x 0.6 = $0.384.

For the seventh glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the seventh glass is $0.384 x 0.6 = $0.226.

For the eighth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the eighth glass is $0.226 x 0.6 = $0.136.

For the ninth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the ninth glass is $0.136 x 0.6 = $0.0816.

For the tenth glass, the price is 60% off the previous price, so the price of the tenth glass is $0.0816 x"

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB per minute, but after 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to update some applications, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from scratch. How many gigabytes will it take to download this file?

I need to know how to calculate the total number of gigabytes that will be downloaded.

Answer:

To calculate the total number of gigabytes that will be downloaded, we need to calculate the total download time and then use the download rate to determine the total amount of data downloaded.

1. Calculate the total download time:

The download was interrupted after 40% of the file was downloaded, so we need to calculate the total download time based on the remaining 60% of the file.

Total download time = (60% of 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute

Total download time = (60% of 200 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 60% of 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

2. Calculate the total number of gigabytes to be downloaded:

Total number of gigabytes = Total download time x Download rate

Total number of gigabytes = 60 minutes x 2 GB/minute = 120 GB

Therefore, it will take 120 gigabytes to download the remaining 60% of the file."
8	John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns around to realize that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but then spends the first 2 hours in a ditch. He spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before he gets a chance to drive the rest of the time with 4 hours left, traveling at 80mph. How far is he from home at the end of these 4 hours?	45	"Answer only. 
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns around to realize that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but then spends the first 2 hours in a ditch. He spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before he gets a chance to drive the rest of the time with 4 hours left, traveling at 80mph. How far is he from home at the end of these 4 hours?

Answer: 20 miles.

Explanation:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

2. He then spends 2 hours in a ditch, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
3. He spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

4. He then drives the rest of the time with 4 hours left, at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 80 mph x 4 hours
Distance = 320 miles

5. Since he spent 2 hours in a ditch, he has only been driving for 4 hours (4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours).
6. Therefore, the total distance he covers is the sum of the distances he covers during each hour:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 320 miles
Total Distance = 515 miles

7. Since he started 3 hours away from home, he is now 515 miles - 3 hours x 60 mph = 515 miles - 180 miles = 20 miles away from home.

Therefore, John is 20 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

A new program received 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month, but then it dropped by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did this program get in total in three months?

Answer: 120 + 180 - 90 = 210

Explanation:

First month: 60 downloads

Second month: 3 times 60 = 180 downloads

Third month: 180 - 30% of 180 = 90 downloads

Total downloads in three months: 60 + 180 - 90 = 210 downloads."

12	Carlos planted a lemon tree. It would cost $90 for a lemon. Each year he would produce 7 lemons, each of which he could sell for $1.5. Water and fertilizer for the tree cost $3 a year. How long would it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos planted a lemon tree. It would cost $90 for a lemon. Each year he would produce 7 lemons, each of which he could sell for $1.5. Water and fertilizer for the tree cost $3 a year. How long would it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?

Answer: 4 years.

Explanation:

Year 1:
Revenue = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Cost = $3
Net loss = $3 - $10.5 = -$7

Year 2:
Revenue = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Cost = $3
Net loss = $3 - $10.5 = -$7

Year 3:
Revenue = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Cost = $3
Net loss = $3 - $10.5 = -$7

Year 4:
Revenue = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Cost = $3
Net profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7

Therefore, it would take 4 years for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree."
13	Melanie was a door-to-door salesperson. She sold three-quarters of her garbage disposal in the green house, 2 in the red house, half of the remainder in the lemon-water house. If Melanie had 5 garbage disposal machines, how many did she start with?	18	"Answer only. 
Melanie was a door-to-door salesperson. She sold three-quarters of her garbage disposal in the green house, 2 in the red house, half of the remainder in the lemon-water house. If Melanie had 5 garbage disposal machines, how many did she start with?

Answer: 8.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Melanie sold three-quarters of her garbage disposal machines in the green house.
* She sold 2 machines in the red house.
* She sold half of the remainder in the lemon-water house.

We can start by subtracting the number of machines sold in the green house and the red house from the total number of machines Melanie had:

5 - (3/4) x 5 = 5 - 3 = 2

Now, we have 2 machines left. Since she sold half of the remainder in the lemon-water house, we can subtract half of 2 from 2:

2 - 1 = 1

Therefore, Melanie started with 8 garbage disposal machines."
14	In a dance class of 20, 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest were involved in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Answer only. 
In a dance class of 20, 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest were involved in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?

Answer: 40%

Explanation:
Let's say x is the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Since 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance, the number of students enrolled in modern dance is 20% of 20, which is:

20% of 20 = 4

So, there are 4 students enrolled in modern dance.

Similarly, since 25% of the students were enrolled in jazz dance, the number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of 20, which is:

25% of 20 = 5

So, there are 5 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Now, let's find out the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

20 - 4 - 5 = 11

There are 11 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

So, the percentage of all students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

11/20 = 0.55

or 55%"
15	A businessman wants to make a purchase choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will rise by 2.5 percent while the electronics market will rise by 1.2 percent this month. If the businessman is looking to increase his profit margin at the end of this month by making a choice, what is this profit margin?	125	"Answer only. 
A businessman wants to make a purchase choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will rise by 2.5 percent while the electronics market will rise by 1.2 percent this month. If the businessman is looking to increase his profit margin at the end of this month by making a choice, what is this profit margin?

Answer: 

Profit margin = (Selling price - Purchase price) / Purchase price

Profit margin = (Selling price - Purchase price) / Purchase price

For jewelry:

Selling price = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125
Purchase price = $5,000
Profit margin = ($5,125 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 2.5%

For electronics:

Selling price = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096
Purchase price = $8,000
Profit margin = ($8,096 - $8,000) / $8,000 = 1.2%

Therefore, the profit margin for jewelry is higher than that of electronics."

19	It takes Marissa an hour to walk the first four miles [12 km], then an hour to walk the next two. If she wants her average speed to be four miles per hour, how much more speed would she need to travel the rest of the way?	6	"Answer only. 
It takes Marissa an hour to walk the first four miles [12 km], then an hour to walk the next two. If she wants her average speed to be four miles per hour, how much more speed would she need to travel the rest of the way?

Answer in units of miles per hour (mph).

Note: Please show your work and explain your reasoning.

Answer:

To find out how much more speed Marissa needs to travel the rest of the way, we first need to find out her total distance traveled so far. We know that she has walked for 4 miles in the first hour and then for another 2 miles in the second hour, so her total distance traveled is:

4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Now, we know that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

Total distance / Time = Average speed

In this case, the total distance is 6 miles and the time is 2 hours, so we can plug these values into the equation:

6 miles / 2 hours = Average speed

Solving for the average speed, we get:

6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles/hour

So, Marissa's average speed is 3 miles per hour.

To find out how much more speed she needs to travel the rest of the way, we can subtract her average speed from the speed she needs to travel the rest of the way:

Speed needed - Average speed = Increase in speed

In this case, the speed she needs to travel the rest of the way is 12 km/hour (since the distance is 12 km), and her average speed is 3 miles/hour, so we can plug these values into the equation:

12 km/hour - 3 miles/hour = Increase in speed

Solving for the increase in speed, we get:

12 km/hour - 3 miles/hour = 9 km/hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to travel at a speed of 9 km/hour to cover the remaining distance of 12 km in order to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour."
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. But when I pour out one liter of orange juice, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. But when I pour out one liter of orange juice, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

Please help me with this problem.

Answer:

Let's break this down step by step.

1. You have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water. So, the water content of the orange juice is:

2/3 x 10 = 6.67 liters (since 2/3 of 10 is 6.67)

2. You want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. So, the water content of the pineapple juice is:

3/5 x 15 = 9 liters (since 3/5 of 15 is 9)

3. When you pour out one liter of orange juice, the remaining orange juice is:

10 - 1 = 9 liters

So, the remaining water content of the orange juice is:

6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters

4. Now, you add the pineapple juice to the remaining orange juice:

9 + 9 = 18 liters

So, the final volume of the mixture is:

5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters

Therefore, when you pour out one liter of orange juice, there are 14.67 liters of the mixture left."

24	Kyle bought last year's edition for $19.50. This included a 25% discount from its original price. What was the actual price of the book?	26	"Answer only. 
Kyle bought last year's edition for $19.50. This included a 25% discount from its original price. What was the actual price of the book?

Answer: $26

Explanation:

Let's say the original price of the book was x.

Kyle bought the book at a discount of 25%, so he paid 75% of the original price.

x - 25% of x = $19.50

x - 0.25x = $19.50

0.75x = $19.50

x = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."

Gunter is trying to count the beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many beans they think there will be in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. The third says 25% more than the first half. What is their average guess?

Answer:

To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

80 + 20 + 25% of 80 = 80 + 20 + 20 = 180

There are 180 beans in the jar, on average."

John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video gems. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He eventually sells 8 video gems for $20 each and has $5 left over. How many sets of Lego does he have now?

Answer:

Let x be the number of Lego sets John has.

Since he sells each set for $15, he has $15x dollars from selling the Lego sets.

He spends $20x dollars on video games, so he has $5x dollars left over.

We know that he has $5 left over, so we can set up the equation:

$5x = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 13

So John has 13 Lego sets."

Polly can throw a golden spear, the only known weapon that can kill the monster, 400 feet, well before reaching the location of the monster's fire belt. But when Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the spear three times faster than it would be if she didn't hold the stone. If she holds the stone, how far would she stand and throw the spear to find the monster dead and the fire belt flapping?	200	"Answer only. 
A giant rock, named Peg, sits there on top of Mount Farbo and shoots fire at anything but 1000 feet away. Polly can throw a golden spear, the only known weapon that can kill the monster, 400 feet, well before reaching the location of the monster's fire belt. But when Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the spear three times faster than it would be if she didn't hold the stone. If she holds the stone, how far would she stand and throw the spear to find the monster dead and the fire belt flapping?

I need help with this problem.

I've tried to use the information provided to set up an equation, but I'm having trouble getting the right equation.

Here's what I have so far:

Let x be the distance from Polly to the monster (in feet)

Let y be the distance from Polly to the fire belt (in feet)

Let z be the distance from the monster to the fire belt (in feet)

We know that the monster shoots fire at anything within 1000 feet, so z = 1000.

We also know that Polly can throw the spear three times faster when she holds the sapphire stone, so the distance she throws the spear is 3x.

We want to find the distance x that Polly needs to stand in order to kill the monster and have the fire belt flapping.

I've tried using the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation, but I'm not sure how to incorporate the fact that Polly can throw the spear three times faster when she holds the sapphire stone.

Can someone please help me with this problem?

I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you in advance."

Goggo Jones baked 5 coffees for the fireman's party. She distributed 8 coffees each and then placed 5 coffees on the buffet table for the guests to eat. Finally in the evening, after the guests ate the coffees, there were 14 left over. How many coffees did the guests eat?

Answer: 9.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Goggo Jones baked 5 coffees for the party.
* She distributed 8 coffees each to the guests.
* There were 14 coffees left over after the guests ate.

Now, let's think about how many coffees the guests ate. We know that Goggo distributed 8 coffees each to the guests, so the total number of coffees the guests ate is:

8 x number of guests = 8x

We also know that there were 14 coffees left over, so we can subtract the number of coffees left over from the total number of coffees the guests ate:

8x - 14 = 8x - 14

Simplifying the equation:

8x - 14 = 8x - 14

The solution to the equation is:

8x = 9

So, the guests ate 9 coffees."
43	According to its nutrient profile, one bag of chips contains 250 grams of chlorine per serving. If a 300-gram bag is to be used 5 times, how many grams can you eat if you daily need 2000 after you have already consumed 1800 calories?	48	"Answer only. 
According to its nutrient profile, one bag of chips contains 250 grams of chlorine per serving. If a 300-gram bag is to be used 5 times, how many grams can you eat if you daily need 2000 after you have already consumed 1800 calories?

Answer: 200 grams.

Explanation:

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total number of grams in the 300-gram bag.

300 grams = 3 x 100 grams

Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.

To calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat, we can divide the number of calories left to consume by the number of calories per serving of chips.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 grams

Therefore, you can eat 0.8 grams of chips, which is equivalent to 80 grams since there are 100 grams in a serving."

Charlie wants to sell wax candles. From each pile of wax, he can make 10 candles. A whole pile of wax and candles cost $10.00 in inventory. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what would be his profit if he sold 20 candles?

Answer: $40.00

How did you get that answer?

Well, first, we know that each pile of wax costs $10.00. So if Charlie sells 20 candles, he has to use 20 piles of wax. That's 20 x $10.00 = $200.00 in wax.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, he'll make $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 in profit."

Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday, on Tuesday the articles she wrote were 2/5 times as many as on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Count the number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days.

Answer: 24 hours.

Explanation:

Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours/article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 5 articles = 10 articles x 4 hours/article = 40 hours
Wednesday: 2 x 10 articles = 20 articles x 4 hours/article = 80 hours

Total hours spent writing articles over the three days: 20 + 40 + 80 = 24 hours."

Candice puts 80 order notes in her bag before she leaves for her job at the coffee shop. On her way, she stops at the grocery store and buys order notes; at work, she puts this one order note on each of the 220 cups of coffee. If she has 23 remaining order notes left in total, how many order notes are in the packet she buys?

Answer: 23

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Candice puts 80 order notes in her bag before she leaves for work.
2. She buys more order notes at the grocery store.
3. She puts one order note on each of 220 cups of coffee at work.
4. She has 23 remaining order notes left in total.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many order notes are in the packet she buys.

Since Candice puts one order note on each of 220 cups of coffee, we know that she uses 220 order notes at work. This means that she has 23 - 220 = 23 remaining order notes left in total.

Since Candice starts with 80 order notes in her bag, we can subtract the number of order notes she uses at work (220) from the number of order notes she has in total (80 + 23) to find out how many order notes are in the packet she buys:

80 + 23 - 220 = 23

Therefore, there are 23 order notes in the packet Candice buys at the grocery store."

50	Lloyd owned a chicken farm. His chicken farm produced 252 eggs a day and he sold them for $2 a dozen. How much did Lloyd make on eggs per week?	294	"Answer only. 
Lloyd owned a chicken farm. His chicken farm produced 252 eggs a day and he sold them for $2 a dozen. How much did Lloyd make on eggs per week?

Please show your work. 

Answer: $156

To find out how much Lloyd made on eggs per week, we need to first find out how many dozen eggs he sold per day.

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Next, we need to find out how many days he sold eggs per week. Let's assume he sold eggs for 7 days a week.

21 dozen eggs per day x 7 days per week = 147 dozen eggs per week

Finally, we can find out how much Lloyd made on eggs per week by multiplying the number of dozen eggs he sold by the price he sold them for.

147 dozen eggs per week x $2 per dozen = $294

Therefore, Lloyd made $294 on eggs per week."
51	Tom's boat can travel at 10 miles per hour. It goes from 1 to 4 in the afternoon. Then it comes back at 6 mph. How long does it take to get back?	5	"Answer only. 
Tom's boat can travel at 10 miles per hour. It goes from 1 to 4 in the afternoon. Then it comes back at 6 mph. How long does it take to get back?

Answer:

The boat travels at 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 in the afternoon, so it covers:

1 to 4 = 3 hours

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 30 miles

The boat then travels back at 6 miles per hour, so it covers:

30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes 5 hours to get back."

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 trailers. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailers tires and did not repair any truck tires. How much extra income did the mechanic earn that day to get the extra work done?

Answer: $240

Explanation:

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, for a total of $360.

The mechanic also repaired 4 trailers at $40 each, for a total of $160.

Total income on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailers at $40 each, for a total of $480.

Total income on Friday = $480.

Total extra income earned on Friday = $480 - $520 = $240."

She said Patchy, the first witch, gave birth to three times as many kittens as they had adopted, while Trixie, the other witch, gave birth to 12. How many cats does the Doubtfire family have now?

Answer: The Doubtfire family has 23 cats now.

To solve this problem, we need to add the number of cats the Doubtfire brothers adopted from the shelter (7) to the number of kittens born to Patchy (3 x 7 = 21) and the number of kittens born to Trixie (12).

Therefore, the total number of cats the Doubtfire family has is:

A wooden bridge can hold no more than 5000 pounds. A truck loaded with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The average weight of the driver and the truck if there is no one inside is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge?

Answer: 100 boxes.

Explanation:

The total weight of the truck and driver is 3755 pounds.
The weight of each box is 15 pounds.
The maximum weight of the truck and driver plus boxes is 3755 + (15 x 100) = 3755 + 1500 = 5255 pounds.
Since the bridge can hold a maximum of 5000 pounds, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's capacity is 5255 - 5000 = 255.
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 255."

Since there are 5 male students for every teacher, there are 5 x 30 = 150 male students.

So, the total number of students is 60 + 150 = 210.

Since there are twice as many men as women, the number of teachers is 210/2 = 105."

Luke was spending his time on the beach building with sand. He finally noticed that each level of the sandcastle would have half the square of the level of the level below it. If he made a standard sandcastle 4 where the top level was 16 squares, what was the average level of one square?

Answer: 4.

Explanation:

The area of each level of the sandcastle is half the area of the level below it. So, the area of the top level (level 4) is half the area of the level below it, which is half the area of the level below that, and so on.

Since the top level has an area of 16 squares, the area of the level below it (level 3) is 16/2 = 8 squares, and the area of the level below that (level 2) is 8/2 = 4 squares.

The area of the bottom level (level 1) is 4/2 = 2 squares.

Therefore, the average level of one square is:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 4."

Then she must feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of the dog's life. If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Answer only. 
Cecilia bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she must feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she must feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of the dog's life. If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Answer: 6 bags.

Explanation:

In the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day, so she will use 180 cups of dog food in total.
Since one dog food bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 6 bags of dog food in the first year.

In the rest of the dog's life, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day, so she will use 2 x 365 = 730 cups of dog food per year.
Since one dog food bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 730 / 110 = 6.67 bags of dog food per year for the rest of the dog's life.

Since we can't use a fraction of a bag, Cecilia will use 6 bags of dog food in the first year and 7 bags of dog food per year for the rest of the dog's life."
77	If Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Let's assume that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, he does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

David does four times as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of laundry.

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is:

1600 - 200 = 1400 pounds."
78	Vincent can buy flowers in a 3-pack for $2.50 or in a 2-pack for $1. How much discount would he get by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price?	6	"Answer only. 
Vincent can buy flowers in a 3-pack for $2.50 or in a 2-pack for $1. How much discount would he get by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price?

Answer:

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in a 3-pack, he will pay $2.50 x 3 = $7.50.
If he buys 18 flowers in a 2-pack, he will pay $1 x 2 = $2.

Therefore, the discount he gets by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price is:

$7.50 - $2 = $5.50

So, the discount is $5.50."

Greg has an alarm set to go off three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it keeps ringing until Greg turns it off. The first time it goes off today, it rings four times. The second time it goes off, it rings three times as much as the first time. The third time, it rings for half the time it rings the second time. How many times does the alarm go off all at once?

I'm having trouble understanding how to approach this problem. Can you help me?

Answer:

The alarm goes off three times, and each time it rings for a different amount of time.

The first time, it rings four times.
The second time, it rings three times as much as the first time, which is 12 times (3 x 4 = 12).
The third time, it rings for half the time it rings the second time, which is 6 times (12 / 2 = 6).

So, the alarm goes off a total of 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times all at once."

One company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for those who have stayed with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after three additional years of service?

Hint: You may need to use a formula to calculate the annual salary.

Answer: $1,290

Explanation:

To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three additional years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after five years of service.

Salary after 5 years = $600 x (1 + 0.10) ^ 5
= $600 x 1.1^5
= $600 x 1.61
= $966

Now, to calculate her salary after three additional years of service, we can use the same formula:

Salary after 8 years = $966 x (1 + 0.10) ^ 3
= $966 x 1.1^3
= $966 x 1.33
= $1,290

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three additional years of service is $1,290."

91	Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three have in total?	28	"Answer only. 
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three have in total?

Answer: 18 pets.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of pets Marcia has.
Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has x + 2 pets.
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3(x + 2) pets.

The total number of pets the three have is the sum of their numbers of pets:

x + 2 + 3(x + 2) = 18

Simplifying, we get:

x + 2 + 3x + 6 = 18

Combine like terms:

4x + 8 = 18

Subtract 8 from both sides:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 5

So Marcia has 5 pets, and Jan has 3 times as many pets, or 15 pets.

Therefore, the three have a total of 5 + 15 = 18 pets."

Lee used to be able to run the 400 meters two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400 meters. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how could Gerald, with his improved diet, manage the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?

Answer:

Gerald, with his improved diet, could manage the 400-meter hurdles in 36.6 seconds.

Explanation:

Lee used to run the 400 meters in 38 seconds, which means Gerald ran the 400 meters in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

If Gerald improved his diet by 10%, he reduced his time by 10% of 40 seconds, which is 4 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, could manage the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = 36.6 seconds."

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?

Let's start by using the information we know about the first friend:

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened.

Now, let's use the information we know about the second friend:

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend.

So, if the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell:

20 x 4 = 80 times

Now, let's use the information we know about the third friend:

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.

So, if the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell:

60 + 10 = 70 times

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell rang:

20 + 80 + 70 = 170 times

Total hours watched = 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Now, we need to find out how many minutes Wednesday's episode was.

30 minutes + 30 minutes (drama) = 60 minutes

So, Wednesday's episode was 60 minutes long."

Henry was baking biscuits for a home-baked meal competition. He wanted to double what he had baked last year. After he finished baking, he realized that he had actually baked 15 more biscuits than he wanted to. He had thrown out 5 of his biscuit biscuits while taking them out for cooling, and now he had 110 biscuits. How many biscuits had Henry baked last year?

Answer: 55 biscuits.

Explanation:

Henry wanted to double what he had baked last year, so if he had baked 55 biscuits last year, he would need to bake 110 biscuits this year (55 x 2 = 110).

However, he had thrown out 5 of the biscuits while taking them out for cooling, so he actually baked 110 - 5 = 105 biscuits this year."
109	A neighborhood gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. The company's app gives $0.20 free for every gallon purchased there. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, what is the price of the gas after the gift?	28	"Answer only. 
A neighborhood gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. The company's app gives $0.20 free for every gallon purchased there. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, what is the price of the gas after the gift?

Answer: $2.80 per gallon.

Explanation:

First, we calculate the price of gas after the gift using the app:

$3.00 x 10 gallons = $30.00
$30.00 - $0.20 x 10 gallons = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Therefore, the price of gas after the gift is $28.00 per gallon."

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake, Beatrice's rol-op is two inches wide and 24 inches long while Marcell's is 3 inches wide and 14 inches tall. If they ate all together, what was the average amount they ate?

Answer:

The total area of Beatrice's rol-op is 2 x 24 = 48 square inches.
The total area of Marcell's rol-op is 3 x 14 = 42 square inches.

The total area they ate is 48 + 42 = 90 square inches.

So, the average amount they ate is 90 / 2 = 45 square inches."

Jamal's phone can take six times as many pictures as Brittany's. The maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can take is 50 times the number of birds on Jamal's photo of a peacock he took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can take 1800 pictures, how many peacocks can be seen in Jamal's photo of a peacock at the zoo?

I have tried to solve this problem using the information provided, but I am not able to come up with the correct answer. Can you please help me?

Here is what I have tried so far:

Let x be the number of birds on Jamal's photo of a peacock at the zoo.

According to the problem, Brittany's phone can take 50 times the number of birds on Jamal's photo of a peacock at the zoo. So, the maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can take is 50x.

Jamal's phone can take six times as many pictures as Brittany's phone, so Jamal's phone can take 6(50x) = 6(50) = 300 pictures.

Now, we are given that Jamal's phone can take 1800 pictures, so we know that 1800 = 300.

I am not sure how to proceed from here. Can you please help me? Thank you!"

Explanation:

The 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so 10 boards would cost $100.

The 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so 5 boards would cost $80.

In total, Sasha would make $100 in profit ($100 - $80 = $20)."

129	The hospital sees about 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges 200 dollars an hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?	10000	"Answer only. 
The hospital sees about 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges 200 dollars an hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Answer:

The hospital sees about 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. So, the total number of minutes the hospital sees patients per day is:

500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total amount the hospital charges for the doctors' time is:

12,000 minutes/day x $150/hour = $1,800,000 per day

The hospital charges $200 per hour for the patients, so the total amount the hospital charges for the patients' time is:

12,000 minutes/day x $200/hour = $2,400,000 per day

The profit for the hospital is the difference between the amount the hospital charges and the amount the hospital pays the doctors:

Profit = $2,400,000 - $1,800,000 = $600,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $600,000 per day."

Nissa hires 60 employees to play the elves in her Santa's village shop. Three-quarters of the elves quit after children threw up on them, and 10 percent of the remaining elves quit after the children died. How many elves are left?

I'm happy to help! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Three-quarters of the elves quit after children threw up on them. This means that 3/4 of 60 elves quit, or 45 elves (60 x 3/4).
2. 10% of the remaining elves quit after the children died. This means that 10% of 45 elves quit, or 4.5 elves (45 x 10%).

So, in total, 45 + 4.5 = 49.5 elves quit.

Therefore, there are 60 - 49.5 = 10.5 elves left in Nissa's Santa's village shop."

133	Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, Tuesday, 6 times the distance he walked on Monday. His total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Answer only. 
Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, Tuesday, 6 times the distance he walked on Monday. His total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?

Let x be the distance Walt walked on Monday.

According to the problem, Walt walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, so he walked 6x miles on Tuesday.

The total distance Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6x = 41

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7x = 41

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 6

So Walt walked 6 miles on Monday.

Since Walt walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, he walked 6 x 6 = 36 miles on Tuesday.

Therefore, Walt walked a total of 6 + 36 = 42 miles from Monday to Wednesday."

There are 700 bees in a hive, twice as many worker bees as worker bees, and twice as many worker bees as worker queens.

1. How many worker bees are there?
2. How many worker queens are there?

Please help me with this problem. Thank you!

Answer:

1. There are 2 times as many worker bees as worker queens, so there are 2 x 2 = 4 worker bees for every worker queen.

Since there are 700 bees in total, there are:

700 - 4(worker queens) = 700 - 4(20) = 700 - 80 = 620 worker bees.

2. There are 20 worker queens in total, since there are twice as many worker bees as worker queens."
142	Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day and has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?	140	"Answer only. 
Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day and has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?

Answer:

Jordan could make $200 per week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working.

Explanation:

If Jordan spent 2 hours per day playing video games, that's a total of 14 hours per week (2 hours/day x 7 days/week).

If he made $10 per hour playing video games, then he would make a total of $140 per week ($10/hour x 14 hours/week).

However, since he has a part-time job that pays him $10 per hour, he would make a total of $200 per week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working ($10/hour x 14 hours/week + $10/hour x 40 hours/week)."

145	John has 10 hectares of banana plantation. There are 100 bananas per hectare. John can harvest bananas every 3 months. How many bananas can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Answer only. 
John has 10 hectares of banana plantation. There are 100 bananas per hectare. John can harvest bananas every 3 months. How many bananas can John harvest in a year?

Answer: 

To find out how many bananas John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate how many bananas he can harvest in a month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Since John can harvest bananas every 3 months, he can harvest bananas 4 times in a year (3 months x 4 times = 12 months).

So, John can harvest 100 bananas per hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 bananas per month.

Therefore, John can harvest 1000 bananas x 12 months = 12,000 bananas in a year."

Brittany and her mother used to go to the museum. Admission was $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gave the cashier one child's ticket and one adult's ticket. If she found $8 change, how much in dollar bills would she give the cashier?

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble figuring out how to solve it.

Answer:

Brittany's mother would give the cashier $8 in dollar bills.

Explanation:

The adult ticket cost $12, so the mother paid $12 - $10 = $2 more than the child's ticket. Since the child's ticket cost $10, the mother paid $2 for the child's ticket.

Therefore, the mother paid a total of $2 + $2 = $4 in dollar bills.

Since she found $8 change, she would give the cashier $8 - $4 = $4 in dollar bills."

On the first day, 5 people on bicycles come to be pressed on two tires. 3 people come to keep their tires pressed to adjust their speed. Finally, one person comes on a motorcycle. How many dollars did she make that day?

Answer: $3.75.

Explanation:

1. 5 people x 2 tires each = 10 tires x $0.25 = $2.50
2. 3 people x 2 tires each = 6 tires x $0.25 = $1.50
3. 1 person x 2 tires = 2 tires x $0.25 = $0.50

Total earnings for the day = $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $3.75."

Blake and Kelly were competing to see who could run the fastest in 15 minutes.They decided to do it on a 100-yard football field.Blake was running backwards and then forwards 15 times.Kelly ran backwards and forwards once, then decided that she didn't want to run near Blake, so she started running backwards for about 40 yards.She did this 34 times.

Who ran faster?

A) Blake
B) Kelly
C) Neither of them ran faster.

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble understanding how to approach it.

Answer: B) Kelly

Explanation:
To determine who ran faster, we need to find out how far each person ran in the given time period.

Blake ran backwards and forwards 15 times, so he ran a total distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran backwards and forwards once, so she ran a total distance of 1 x 100 = 100 yards. However, she then ran backwards for about 40 yards, so her total distance is 100 + 40 = 140 yards.

Since Kelly ran a shorter distance than Blake, the correct answer is B) Kelly."

On Monday the water tank was 17 feet deep. On Tuesday, the tank had an additional 7 feet of water. On Wednesday, the water tank was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. How deep was the water tank on Wednesday?

Answer: 11 feet.

Explanation:

Let's start by finding out how deep the tank was on Tuesday:

On Tuesday, the tank had an additional 7 feet of water, so the depth of the tank on Tuesday is:

17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, on Wednesday, the tank is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:

24 x 2/3 = 16 feet

So, the water tank was 16 feet deep on Wednesday."

Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 seahorses less than Anakin, and 2 clownfish more than Anakin. How many fish did they catch?

Answer:

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish, so he caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, so she caught 5 x 19 = 95 starfish.

Locsin also caught 3 seahorses less than Anakin, so she caught 3 x 19 = 57 seahorses.

Locsin caught 2 clownfish more than Anakin, so she caught 2 x 3 = 6 clownfish.

In total, Locsin caught 95 + 57 + 6 = 158 fish."

It takes Billy about a minute and a half to slice one potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?

I can do this!

To find out how long it will take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes, we need to find out how long it will take him to slice and cut all 60 potatoes.

First, we'll find out how long it will take him to slice all the potatoes:

60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Now, we'll find out how long it will take him to cut all the sliced potatoes:

90 minutes x 5 seconds per potato = 450 seconds

So, it will take Billy a total of 450 seconds (or 7.5 minutes) to finish preparing the potatoes for the barbecue."

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon and sugar for $2 a gallon; they sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for a gallon; if they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?

Let x be the cost of the lemon.

They sell 20 gallons of lemon juice at $3 a gallon, so they get $60 from lemon juice sales.
They sell 20 glasses of sugar at $0.50 each, so they get $10 from sugar sales.

Total revenue is $60 + $10 = $70.

Total cost is x + $25, since they make a profit of $25.

We want to find out how much did they spend on the lemon, so we set up the equation:

x + $25 = $70

Solve for x:

x = $45

So, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $45 on the lemon."

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and gives half of the rest to charity. He gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for a shopping budget and other household items. If Zaid earns $6000 per month, how much will he earn after these expenses and donations?

Answer: $4,570

Explanation:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
3. Charity: Half of $6000 = $3000
4. Daughter's weekly expenses: $200
5. Wife's shopping budget and other household items: $700

Total expenses and donations: $1500 + $2000 + $3000 + $200 + $700 = $4570

Therefore, after these expenses and donations, Zaid will have $6000 - $4570 = $1430 remaining."

The other team is not so surrounded; their first runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds and each next runner will run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Using this information, how many seconds should the winning team have?

Answer: 2 seconds.

Explanation:
The first team's runners will all run in 55 seconds, so their total time for the 4 x 400 meter race will be:

55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The second team's runners will run in the following times:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Since the first team's total time is less than the second team's total time by 2 seconds, the first team will win the race."
184	Jerry is rolling a six-sided dice. How much (expressed as a percentage) has he rolled more than 3 numbers than he has rolled two consecutive numbers?	25	"Answer only. 
Jerry is rolling a six-sided dice. How much (expressed as a percentage) has he rolled more than 3 numbers than he has rolled two consecutive numbers?

Note: 2 consecutive numbers are 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, etc.

Please provide step-by-step solution to reach the answer.

Thank you.

Answer:

To determine how much Jerry has rolled more than 3 numbers, we need to count the number of times he has rolled each number. Let's do this by keeping track of the number of times each number appears as Jerry rolls the dice.

1. Roll 1: Jerry rolls a 4. He has now rolled 4, but not 3.
2. Roll 2: Jerry rolls a 5. He has now rolled 5, but not 3 or 4.
3. Roll 3: Jerry rolls a 2. He has now rolled 2, 4, and 5, but not 3.
4. Roll 4: Jerry rolls a 3. He has now rolled 2, 3, 4, and 5, but not 1.
5. Roll 5: Jerry rolls a 6. He has now rolled 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, but not 1 or 2.

Now, let's count how many times Jerry has rolled each number:

* 2: 1 time
* 3: 1 time
* 4: 2 times
* 5: 2 times
* 6: 1 time

To find out how much Jerry has rolled more than 3 numbers, we need to subtract the number of times he has rolled 3 from the total number of rolls. There are 5 rolls in total, so:

5 - 1 = 4

188	A merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each. If each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each. If each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?

I have tried using the information that the total profit is $400 and that each sack sold for $30 to set up an equation, but I am having trouble solving for the number of sacks.

Can you please help me with this problem?

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. The merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each.
2. Each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse.
3. The merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each.

Now, let's set up an equation based on the information:

Cost of transporting all sacks = $2 x Number of sacks

Profit from selling all sacks = $30 x Number of sacks

Total profit = $400

Now, we can set up an equation using the above information:

$2x + $30x = $400

$32x = $400

x = $400 / $32

x = 12.5

Therefore, the merchant sold 12.5 sacks of wheat."

Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees are dead. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: 20 trees.

Explanation:

At the start, Tom has 50 trees.

Every year, he plants 10 new trees and cuts down 2 old trees, so the number of trees he has at the end of the year is:

50 + 10 - 2 = 58

This continues for 10 years, so the number of trees he has at the end of the 10th year is:

58 + 10 - 2 = 68

After 10 years, 30% of the trees are dead, which means that 30% of 68 is:

68 x 0.3 = 20

So, Tom has 20 trees left after 10 years."

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another collection of 18 pink plastic flamingos in the same yard. By Sunday afternoon, how many more plastic flamingos were out than white?

Answer: 18.

Explanation: At the start of the weekend, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's yard. On Saturday morning, 6 of the pink flamingos were painted white and put back in the yard, so there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. On Sunday morning, 18 new pink flamingos were added to the yard, bringing the total number of flamingos to 12 + 18 = 30. By Sunday afternoon, there were 30 - 12 = 18 more pink flamingos in the yard than white."

196	200 pounds of carrots will be distributed to 40 restaurants in one city. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?	120	"Answer only. 
200 pounds of carrots will be distributed to 40 restaurants in one city. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 18 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Explanation:

200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 2 pounds per restaurant

2 pounds x 40 restaurants = 80 pounds used

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds not used

120 pounds / 2 pounds per restaurant = 60 restaurants

60 restaurants x 2 pounds per restaurant = 120 pounds not used"

Elaine originally had 20 Pokemon cards. A month later she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than she had collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?

Let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she had initially, which was 20. So she collected 20 x 3 = 60 cards.
2. In the second month, Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in the first month. So she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
3. In the third month, Elaine collected twice as many cards as she had collected in the first and second months. So she collected 40 + (2 x 60) = 40 + 120 = 160 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 160 Pokemon cards."

Mark was a copy-editor. In one week he edited the same number of sentences for two different authors, each of whom paid him a different amount of money per sentence. Author B paid Mark twice what Author A paid him. Mark edited a total of 1000 sentences per week, and Author A paid him 5 cents per sentence. How much did Mark make in a week, in terms of cents?

Answer:

Mark made $50 from Author A and $100 from Author B, for a total of $150.

Explanation:

Since Mark edited 1000 sentences per week, he made 5 cents per sentence from Author A, for a total of $50.

Author B paid Mark twice what Author A paid him, so Author B paid Mark $10 per sentence. Since Mark edited 1000 sentences per week, he made $10 x 1000 = $10,000 from Author B.

Therefore, Mark made a total of $50 + $10,000 = $150 per week."

John won a prize at work. The prize consisted of a one-time cash award of $5000 plus a 5% bonus. If he earned $2000 a week, every week of the year and earned the prize on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?

Answer:

To calculate the total amount earned by John in a year, we need to add the one-time cash award of $5000 and the 5% bonus.

One-time cash award: $5000
Bonus: 5% of $2000/week = 5% x $10,400 (earned in a year) = $520
Total amount earned: $5000 + $520 = $5520

Since John earned the prize on the first day of the year, he earned $5520 in that year."

Sara is raising her neighbor's children 4 times, earning $5 for each time she raises them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts raising children, how many times does she have to cut the grass before she can get the jacket and shoes?

Question:

Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara is raising her neighbor's children 4 times, earning $5 for each time she raises them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts raising children, how many times does she have to cut the grass before she can get the jacket and shoes?

Answer:

To find out how many times Sara has to cut the grass, we need to calculate how much money she will earn from raising the children and compare it to the cost of the items she wants to buy.

First, let's calculate how much money Sara will earn from raising the children:

4 times $5 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount Sara has already saved from the total amount she needs to buy the items:

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Sara needs to raise the children 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Therefore, Sara has to cut the grass 10 times to earn $40, which is enough to buy the jacket and shoes."

216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back the loan with an additional 10% interest. If she had to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janeth have left over?	220	"Answer only. 
Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back the loan with an additional 10% interest. If she had to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janeth have left over?

Answer: $1,632.50

Explanation:

First, we need to calculate the total amount that Janeth will pay over the 12 months:

$2,000 (principal) + ($2,000 x 10%) = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Next, we can calculate the monthly payments:

$2,200 / 12 = $183.33

So, Janeth will pay $183.33 per month for 12 months.

Finally, we can calculate how much money Janeth will have left over after paying off the loan:

$2,200 - ($183.33 x 12) = $2,200 - $2,199.96 = $1,632.50

Therefore, Janeth will have $1,632.50 left over after paying off the loan."

James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire types, 20 grass types, and 40 water types. If he loses 8 of the water types and buys 14 grass types, what is the probability that (rounded to the nearest number) the selected card will not be a water type?

I am trying to use the following formula:

P(not water type) = (number of non-water types) / (total number of cards)

So, in this case, P(not water type) = (30 + 20) / (30 + 20 + 40) = 50 / 90 = 0.56

Therefore, the probability that the selected card will not be a water type is approximately 0.56 or 56%.

Is this correct?"

Chad ordered a burrito-your-own for lunch. The original Burrito was $6.50. He added meat for $2.00, additional candy for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and 2 soups for $0.25 each. He decided to enhance his meal with an additional $3.00 which would add fries and drinks. He had a $5.00 gift card which he used to check in. How much was still owed?

Answer: $10.75.

Here's the breakdown:

* Original Burrito: $6.50
* Meat: $2.00
* Avocado: $1.00
* Candy: $1.00
* Soups: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
* Enhancement: $3.00

Total cost: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $10.75

Chad's $5.00 gift card was applied to the total cost, leaving $10.75 still owed."

Mark bought his company a series of 12 cars. Each car sold for $20,000. He paid 10% tax on the cars and then paid $1000 for registration on each of them. How much did he pay for everything?

Answer:

Mark paid a total of $240,000 for the 12 cars.

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

He paid $20,000 in tax, which is 10% of $240,000.

$20,000 = 10% x $240,000

He paid $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

$1000 x 12 = $12,000

So, in total, Mark paid $240,000 for the cars, $20,000 in tax, and $12,000 for registration, for a total of $272,000."

Dax went to their garden to pick apples, and found half the number of insects if the number of ants in the garden is included. If there are 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.

Answer: 75.

Explanation:

If there are 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half the number of insects if the ants are included, then the total number of insects in the garden is twice the number of ants.

Twice 50 is 100.

So, there are 100 insects in the garden."

245	There are 4 sea turtles in one aquarium and 32 sea turtles in another. The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums. If all the turtles have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 sea turtles in one aquarium and 32 sea turtles in another. The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums. If all the turtles have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are in each aquarium?

Please help!

Answer: Let's assume that the number of fish in the first aquarium is x.

Since there are 4 sea turtles in the first aquarium, the number of fish in the first aquarium is 4x.

The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums, so we can write:

4 - 3 = 2(4x + 32)

Simplifying, we get:

4 - 3 = 2(4x + 32)

4x + 32 = 12

Solving for x, we get:

4x = 8

x = 2

So, there are 2 fish in each aquarium."

3. Refund for one rotten bag = $1.50 per bag = $1.50"
249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister. On Tuesday she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat than her sister?	5,600	"Answer only. 
On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister. On Tuesday she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat than her sister?

Answer: 160 calories

Explanation:
Let's start by finding out how much Sue ate on Monday. Since she ate 4 times more than her sister, her sister ate 5 biscuits, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 biscuits on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as much as her sister, so her sister ate 13 biscuits (since she ate 5 on Monday). Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 biscuits on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Sue ate:

Monday: 20 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 4000 calories
Tuesday: 26 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 5200 calories
Total: 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories

Since her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 biscuits on Tuesday, her total is:

Monday: 5 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 1000 calories
Tuesday: 13 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 2600 calories
Total: 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories

Therefore, Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories more than her sister."
