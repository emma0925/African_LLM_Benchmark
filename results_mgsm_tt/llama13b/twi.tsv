Janet lays 16 eggs a day. She eats three every morning and bakes four for her friends every day. She sells the rest, and earns $2 per egg at the farmer's market every day. What's the dollar amount for a dabia at the farmer's market?

Answer: $32

Explanation:

* Janet lays 16 eggs per day.
* She eats 3 eggs every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
* She bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
* She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmer's market for $2 per egg, so she earns $2 x 9 = $18.
* Therefore, the dollar amount for a dozen (12) eggs at the farmer's market is $18 / 12 = $32."

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if they all have 20 sheep?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if they all have 20 sheep?

Please provide step by step solution.

Thank you.

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
2. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. All three cities have 20 sheep.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many sheep each city has.

Step 1: Find out how many sheep Toulouse has.
Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we know that Toulouse has 2 x 20 = 40 sheep.

Step 2: Find out how many sheep Charleston has.
Since Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, we know that Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Step 3: Find out how many sheep Seattle has.
Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

So, the number of sheep each city has is:

Toulouse: 40
Charleston: 80
Seattle: 20"

10	An app is downloaded from a user's mobile device 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number in the first month, and 30% less in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in all three months?	366	"Answer only. 
An app is downloaded from a user's mobile device 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number in the first month, and 30% less in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in all three months?

Answer:

In the first month, the app was downloaded 60 times.

In the second month, the number of downloads is three times the number in the first month, so the app was downloaded 3 x 60 = 180 times.

In the third month, the number of downloads is 30% less than the number in the second month, so the app was downloaded 180 x 0.7 = 126 times.

Therefore, the app was downloaded a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times in all three months."

12	Carlos is planting a tree. The cost of planting a tree is $90 per year, while planting 7 trees can cost $1.5 each. He spends $3 per year watering the tree. How many years will it take to get the money?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos is planting a tree. The cost of planting a tree is $90 per year, while planting 7 trees can cost $1.5 each. He spends $3 per year watering the tree. How many years will it take to get the money?

Answer: 4 years.

Explanation:

To get the money, Carlos needs to spend $1.5 on planting 7 trees.

7 trees x $1.5 = $10.5

He spends $3 per year watering the tree, so he needs to wait for 4 years to get the money:

$10.5 - $3 = $7.5

$7.5 / $3 = 4

Therefore, it will take 4 years to get the money."

A seller offers to buy two items: jewelry for $5,000 and electrical equipment for $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to grow 2.5% and the electrical equipment market to grow 1.2% in the same month. If the seller offers to make a profit at the end of the month, what is the profit?

(Note: This is a basic question of finance, and I have tried my best to provide accurate information. However, I would appreciate any corrections or clarifications.)

Answer:

To find the profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the seller's investment at the end of the month. The expected value is the sum of the product of each item's price and its expected growth rate.

Expected value = (5000 x 1.025) + (8000 x 1.012)

Expected value = 5125 + 8096

Expected value = 13221

So, the seller's expected profit is $13,221."

Two trains depart San Rafael at the same time. He starts heading east, both going 80 kilometers. On the last day, they go to the top, and cross 150 kilometers. How many trains will each train cross in two days?

Please explain the steps you take to find the solution to the problem.

Answer:

In 2 days, each train will cover 2 x 80 = 160 km.

Explanation:

We know that both trains start at the same time and head east, so they cover the same distance in both days. The distance covered in one day is 80 km, so the total distance covered in 2 days is 2 x 80 = 160 km."

20	I have two-thirds of a gallon of 10 liters of water and I want to add 15 liters of five-thirds of a gallon of water. But while I was pouring it, I spilled one gallon of water on the ground. How much water is left in the other 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have two-thirds of a gallon of 10 liters of water and I want to add 15 liters of five-thirds of a gallon of water. But while I was pouring it, I spilled one gallon of water on the ground. How much water is left in the other 24 liters?

Answer: 14.66 liters.

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the amount of water that was originally in the 10-liter container:

2/3 gallon = 2 x 3 = 6 liters

So, there were 6 liters of water in the container.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water that was added:

5/3 gallon = 5 x 3 = 15 liters

So, 15 liters of water were added to the container.

However, we spilled 1 gallon of water, which is equal to 3 liters:

3 liters

So, the total amount of water left in the container is:

6 + 15 - 3 = 14.66 liters

Therefore, there are 14.66 liters of water left in the other 24 liters."

27	Cynthia eats one apple every night. She buys a box of 15 apples for $4.00. Sixty days later, what do you think she will bet on the apples?	16	"Answer only. 
Cynthia eats one apple every night. She buys a box of 15 apples for $4.00. Sixty days later, what do you think she will bet on the apples?

Answer: $4.00

Explanation:

Cynthia eats one apple every night, so she will finish the box of 15 apples in 15 nights (2 weeks).

Since she paid $4.00 for the box, and she ate 15 apples, she paid $4.00 / 15 apples = $0.27 per apple.

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will still have 15 apples left, which she bought for $4.00, so she will not have gained or lost any money. The answer is $4.00."

30	The difference between Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11. If both of them are 162 years old, find out how old Allen will be ten years from now.	109	"Answer only. 
The difference between Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11. If both of them are 162 years old, find out how old Allen will be ten years from now.

Hint: Darrell is 162 - 7 = 155 years old.

Let's assume that Allen's age is A years old. Then, we can write:

A = 162 - 7 = 155

Now, we want to find out how old Allen will be ten years from now. So, we can add 10 to his current age:

A + 10 = ?

Can you solve for A + 10?"

Gunter wants to count the number of leaves in a bottle. He asks how many friends they think are in one bottle. One says eighty. Another says twenty is half as much as the first. A third says fifty percent as much as the first. What is the average of all of them?

What is the average of all of them?

Let's call the first person's estimate x.

The second person's estimate is half of x, so it is x/2.

The third person's estimate is 50% of x, so it is 0.5x.

We can list all of the estimates:

x, x/2, 0.5x

To find the average, we add all of the estimates and divide by the number of estimates:

x + x/2 + 0.5x = (x + x/2 + x)/3

Simplifying, we get:

3x + x/2 + 0.5x = 3x + 1.5x = 4.5x

Dividing by 3, we get:

4.5x/3 = 1.5

So, the average of the three estimates is 1.5."

34	Aaron has 5 pieces and Raymond has half of all the pieces. If Raymond has 40 pieces, how many pieces does Siobhan have?	23	"Answer only. 
Aaron has 5 pieces and Raymond has half of all the pieces. If Raymond has 40 pieces, how many pieces does Siobhan have?

Let's say Raymond has x pieces.
Since Raymond has half of all the pieces, Aaron has half of all the pieces too.
So, Aaron has half of x pieces.

We know that Raymond has 40 pieces, so:

x = 40

Now, we can find out how many pieces Aaron has:

Aaron has half of x pieces:

Aaron has half of 40 pieces:

Aaron has 20 pieces

Now, we know that Siobhan has all the pieces that Aaron doesn't have.
So, Siobhan has:

40 - 20 = 20 pieces

Therefore, Siobhan has 20 pieces."

He can run four times faster than a man, but he can run the rope twice as fast as he can run. If he throws the rope three times an hour, how long would it take him to cross it in six hours if he ran one of the boys three times and two of the boys three times?

Answer: 
The boy can run 4 times faster than a man, so he can run the rope 4 times faster than a man can run.

If he throws the rope three times an hour, he can run the rope 3 x 4 = 12 times in one hour.

If he runs one of the boys three times, he can run the boy three times in one hour.

If he runs two of the boys three times, he can run the two boys three times in one hour.

So, in six hours, he can run the rope 12 x 6 = 72 times and the two boys 3 x 6 = 18 times."

Total calories per day = (daily calorie goal x serving size) / (calories per serving x number of servings)

Answer:

Total calories per day = (2000 x 300g) / (5 x 6) = 18000 calories per day

Therefore, you can eat 300g of chips per day if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per day."

49	Richard lives in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, three-quarters of which are occupied. How many rooms are occupied in the building?	30	"Answer only. 
Richard lives in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, three-quarters of which are occupied. How many rooms are occupied in the building?

I'm happy to help! Here's the solution:

To find out how many rooms are occupied in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms per floor that are occupied. In this case, we know that three-quarters of the rooms on each floor are occupied, so we can multiply the number of floors by 3/4 of the number of rooms per floor.

Let's start by finding out how many rooms there are on each floor:

8 rooms per floor x 15 floors = 120 rooms per floor

Now, we can multiply the number of rooms per floor by the fraction of rooms that are occupied:

120 rooms per floor x 3/4 = 90 rooms per floor

Since there are 15 floors in the building, we can multiply the number of rooms per floor by the number of floors to find out how many rooms are occupied in the building:

90 rooms per floor x 15 floors = 1350 rooms

Therefore, there are 1350 rooms occupied in the building."

53	On Thursday, the technician repaired 6 cars and on Friday, the technician repaired 12 cars and did not repair any cars. How much money did the technician receive on the day he received the money?	40	"Answer only. 
On Thursday, the technician repaired 6 cars and on Friday, the technician repaired 12 cars and did not repair any cars. How much money did the technician receive on the day he received the money?

Answer: $180.

Explanation:

The technician repaired 6 cars on Thursday and received $60 per car, so the total amount received on Thursday was:

6 cars x $60 per car = $360

On Friday, the technician repaired 12 cars and received $60 per car, so the total amount received on Friday was:

12 cars x $60 per car = $720

Since the technician did not repair any cars on Thursday, the total amount received on the day he received the money was:

$360 + $720 = $180

Therefore, the technician received $180 on the day he received the money."

If the film company took a 10% interest in the first half of the year and he took a 10% interest in the second half of the year, find out how much he paid the film company for the entire year.	1596	"Answer only. 
Yesterday, he was listed among the producers of a film for which he was paid $140 a month. If the film company took a 10% interest in the first half of the year and he took a 10% interest in the second half of the year, find out how much he paid the film company for the entire year.

Answer: $1,400.

To find out how much the film company paid the producer, we need to first find out how much the producer paid the film company. We know that the producer paid $140 per month, so for the first half of the year (6 months), the producer paid $140 x 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (6 months), the producer took a 10% interest, which means the film company paid him $840 x 1.1 = $924.

Therefore, the total amount the film company paid the producer for the entire year is $840 + $924 = $1,764."

Sophia is planning to take her car on a trip, and she wants to see where each tank of fuel will take her. She has cut 100 gallons of oil since she put it in the tank and needs to put 4 gallons of oil in it before filling it again. The doctor's note on the tank says that the tank can hold 12 gallons of oil.

How far can Sophia travel with the tank of fuel she has?

Answer:

Sophia can travel 12 - 4 = 8 gallons x 6.8 miles/gallon = 50.4 miles.

Explanation:

To find out how far Sophia can travel, we need to subtract the amount of oil she has already used (4 gallons) from the total amount of oil the tank can hold (12 gallons). This gives us the amount of oil left in the tank:

12 - 4 = 8 gallons

Next, we multiply the amount of oil left in the tank by the number of miles per gallon the car can travel to find out how far Sophia can travel:

8 gallons x 6.8 miles/gallon = 50.4 miles

Therefore, Sophia can travel 50.4 miles with the tank of fuel she has."

There are four schools, each sending one women's team and one men's team, for a total of eight teams. Each team has five players, so there are 8 x 5 = 40 players. Each team also has one coach, so there are 8 x 1 = 8 coaches. In total, all the schools send 40 players + 8 coaches = 20 people."
67	The treasure-seeker finds a treasure chest full of precious stones. It is 175 cubits long, and the precious stones are less than 35 cubits and twice as many as the diamonds. What are the precious stones in the chest?	595	"Answer only. 
The treasure-seeker finds a treasure chest full of precious stones. It is 175 cubits long, and the precious stones are less than 35 cubits and twice as many as the diamonds. What are the precious stones in the chest?

Note: 1 cubit = 18 inches

Answer: The precious stones in the chest are rubies and emeralds.

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the number of diamonds in the chest. Since the precious stones are less than 35 cubits and twice as many as the diamonds, we can set up the equation:

Let x be the number of diamonds.

Since the chest is 175 cubits long, and each diamond is 18 inches long, we can calculate the total length of diamonds as:

18 inches x 35 cubits = 630 inches

Now, we know that the total length of all precious stones is 175 cubits, so we can add the length of diamonds to the length of the other precious stones:

630 inches + (2 x y) inches

where y is the length of each precious stone (other than diamonds).

We know that the precious stones are less than 35 cubits, so the maximum value of y is 35. Therefore, we can substitute y = 35 into the equation:

630 inches + (2 x 35) inches = 630 inches + 700 inches = 1330 inches

Since the total length of all precious stones is 175 cubits, we can set up the equation:

1330 inches = 175 cubits

Now, we can convert inches to cubits:

1330 inches / 18 inches/cubit = 73 cubits

Therefore, there are 73 cubits of precious stones in the chest, and since each cubit is 18 inches long, there are:

73 cubits x 18 inches/cubit = 1330 inches

of precious stones in the chest."

Artie doesn't change any of the prices, so she doesn't think she's going to pay the full dollar. If Artie sells marigolds for 12, petunias for 9 and begonias for 17, why not?	88	"Answer only. 
Artie sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. She sells marigolds for $2.74 each, petunias for $1.87 each and begonias for $2.12 each. Artie doesn't change any of the prices, so she doesn't think she's going to pay the full dollar. If Artie sells marigolds for 12, petunias for 9 and begonias for 17, why not?

This is a classic problem of mental math, and the answer is that Artie will not pay the full dollar because the total amount she will receive from the sales is $2.74 + $1.87 + $2.12 = $6.73, which is less than $10.

So, Artie will not pay the full dollar."

Cecilia bought a new puppy. Following the advice of an animal health professional, the puppy should be given one cup of dog food a day for the first 180 days. And then the puppy should be given two cups of dog food for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food costs 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need in the first year?

Answer: 3 bags of dog food.

Explanation:

In the first 180 days, the puppy should be given one cup of dog food per day, so the total amount of dog food needed is:

1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups

Since one bag of dog food costs 110 cups, Cecilia will need:

180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 3 bags of dog food in the first year."
77	If Raymond weighs half as much as Sarah, and Sarah weighs 4 times as much as David, find the difference between Raymond's and David's weights if Sarah weighs 400 pounds.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond weighs half as much as Sarah, and Sarah weighs 4 times as much as David, find the difference between Raymond's and David's weights if Sarah weighs 400 pounds.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem.

Let S be Sarah's weight, which is given as 400 pounds.
Let R be Raymond's weight, which is given as half of Sarah's weight.
Let D be David's weight, which is given as 4 times as much as David's weight.

We know that:

S = 400 pounds
R = S/2 = 400/2 = 200 pounds
D = 4S = 4(400) = 1600 pounds

Now we want to find the difference between Raymond's weight and David's weight:

D - R = 1600 - 200 = 1400 pounds

Therefore, the difference between Raymond's weight and David's weight is 1400 pounds."
78	Vincent can buy three boxes of flowers for $2.50 or two boxes for $1. How much money would he save if he bought 18 flowers at the right price?	6	"Answer only. 
Vincent can buy three boxes of flowers for $2.50 or two boxes for $1. How much money would he save if he bought 18 flowers at the right price?

Answer: $1.50.

Explanation:

If Vincent buys three boxes of flowers for $2.50, each box costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per box.

If he buys two boxes for $1, each box costs $1 / 2 = $0.50 per box.

To find out how much money Vincent would save by buying 18 flowers at the right price, we need to find out how much he would pay for 18 flowers at each price.

At $2.50 per box, 18 flowers would cost:

18 flowers x $0.83 per flower = $14.64

At $1 per box, 18 flowers would cost:

18 flowers x $0.50 per flower = $9.00

So, Vincent would save $14.64 - $9.00 = $1.64 by buying 18 flowers at the right price."

The third time it crashed, it crashed two times faster than the first time. In total, how many times did the device crash?

I'm stuck on this one. Can you help?

Answer: The device crashed 5 times in total.

Explanation:

1st time: 4 crashes
2nd time: 3 crashes x 3 faster = 9 crashes
3rd time: 2 crashes x 2 faster = 4 crashes
Total: 4 + 9 + 4 = 5 crashes."

89	Christina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest, since 1/4 of the guests are female. She invites 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2.	24	"Answer only. 
Christina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest, since 1/4 of the guests are female. She invites 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2.

How many dollars will Christina spend on gift bags?

Please show your calculation.

Answer:

To find out how many dollars Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Since 1/4 of the guests are female, we can calculate the number of female guests as follows:

16 guests x 1/4 = 4 female guests

So, Christina needs 75 gift bags for the 12 male guests and 4 female guests.

Total cost of gift bags = 75 x $2 = $150

Therefore, Christina will spend $150 on gift bags."

Did he know that each adult dinosaur would eat 10 lbs of atomic particles, and each infant would eat half of the adult's? If 20 adults and 5 children attended this feeding session, what would be the atomic weight of the food that Ted would bring to the feeding session if he didn't have enough to give to everyone?	225	"Answer only. 
And Ted, the T-Rex was planning to add atomic particles to the dinosaur diet. Did he know that each adult dinosaur would eat 10 lbs of atomic particles, and each infant would eat half of the adult's? If 20 adults and 5 children attended this feeding session, what would be the atomic weight of the food that Ted would bring to the feeding session if he didn't have enough to give to everyone?

Atomic weight of a substance is the average weight of one atom of that substance.

So, the total weight of the atomic particles that Ted would bring to the feeding session would be:

20 adults x 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs
5 children x 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Total weight of atomic particles = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

Therefore, the atomic weight of the food that Ted would bring to the feeding session would be:

225 lbs / (20 adults + 5 children) = 11.25 lbs/person

So, Ted would need to bring 11.25 lbs of atomic particles to the feeding session for every person attending, including the 20 adults and 5 children."

93	Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles twice as fast as Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles. However, Gerald changed his speed to increase his race by 10%. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, why did Gerald, in his fifties, run the 400-meter hurdles in 30 seconds?	36	"Answer only. 
Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles twice as fast as Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles. However, Gerald changed his speed to increase his race by 10%. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, why did Gerald, in his fifties, run the 400-meter hurdles in 30 seconds?

Let's assume that Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in x seconds.

According to the problem, Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles twice as fast as Gerald, so Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles in 2x seconds.

We know that Gerald changed his speed to increase his race by 10%, so his new time is:

2x + 10% of 2x = 2x + 0.1(2x)

Simplify the expression:

2x + 0.1(2x) = 2x + 0.1(2x) = 2x + 0.2x

Combine like terms:

2x + 0.2x = 3x

So, Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles in 3x seconds.

Since Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:

38 = 3x

Solve for x:

x = 12

So, Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles in 30 seconds (2x = 30)."

Jerome had 4 friends visiting him in a day. The first friend knocked on the door 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend knocked on the door 1⁄4 more times than Jerome's first friend. The third friend knocked on the door 10 times than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend knocked on the door 60 times, how many times did the door knock?

Answer: 75 times.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information we know:

1. The first friend knocked on the door 20 times.
2. The second friend knocked on the door 1/4 more times than the first friend, so the second friend knocked on the door:

20 x 4 = 80 times.

3. The third friend knocked on the door 10 times more than the second friend, so the third friend knocked on the door:

80 + 10 = 90 times.

4. The fourth friend knocked on the door 60 times.

Now we need to find out how many times the door was knocked in total. We can do this by adding up all the times the friends knocked:

20 + 80 + 90 + 60 = 75 times.

So, the door was knocked 75 times in total."

105	Cody plays three times as many cards as Amir. If Amir plays 5 cards, how many cards do they have in total?	20	"Answer only. 
Cody plays three times as many cards as Amir. If Amir plays 5 cards, how many cards do they have in total?

Answer: 15 cards.

Explanation:

Let's say Amir plays x cards. Since Cody plays three times as many cards as Amir, Cody plays 3x cards.

We know that the total number of cards played by both players is 5.

So, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x = 5

Simplifying the equation:

4x = 5

Solving for x:

x = 1

So, Amir plays 1 card, and Cody plays 3 cards.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have is:

Amir: 1 card
Cody: 3 cards

Total: 4 cards."

Tokuro came to Julia's boat while she was on the lake. Two liters of water flowed into the boat four times out of every ten minutes she spent on land. She walked for sixteen minutes and walked twelve times out of every ten minutes. The land was after 64 degrees. How much water flowed into the boat when Julia reached the land?

Answer: 4 liters.

Explanation:

1. Julia spent 16 minutes on land.
2. She spent 12 minutes of those 16 minutes walking.
3. Two liters of water flowed into the boat every 10 minutes she spent on land.
4. Therefore, 2 x 4 = 8 liters of water flowed into the boat while Julia was on land.
5. Since Julia spent 16 minutes on land, she spent 8 minutes walking (12 minutes / 10 minutes per minute).
6. Therefore, 8 liters of water flowed into the boat while Julia was walking on land.
7. Total water flowed into the boat = 8 + 4 = 12 liters.

Katy uses a teaspoon of sugar and a cup of water in a ratio of 7:13 for coffee. If in total, she used 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

Answer: 90 teaspoons of sugar.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the ratio of sugar to water as 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water. A cup is equal to 8 ounces, and there are 64 teaspoons in a cup.

So, we can set up a proportion to represent the situation:

7x (sugar) = 13(water)

where x is the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, so we can set up an equation:

7x = 120

Solving for x, we get:

x = 90

Therefore, Katy used 90 teaspoons of sugar."

Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries are higher, and Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago, what is the difference between their salaries?

Let's begin by analyzing the information we have:

1. Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
2. Four years later, Lylah's salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago.
3. Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago.

Let's start by finding Lylah's salary four years ago. Since her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago, we can multiply her current salary by 1.4 to find her salary four years ago:

Lylah's current salary = $x
Lylah's salary four years ago = $x \* 1.4 = $x \* 140%

Now, we know that Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. So, we can find Adrien's salary by multiplying Lylah's salary by 1.3 (100% + 30%):

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary \* 1.3 = $x \* 1.3

Now, we know that Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago. So, we can find Adrien's current salary by adding $400,000 to their salary four years ago:

Adrien's current salary = Adrien's salary four years ago + $400,000 = $x \* 1.3 + $400,000

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (Lylah's salary and Adrien's salary). We can substitute the expression for Adrien's salary into the equation for Lylah'"

123	Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for three hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles does she run in 7 hours?	50	"Answer only. 
Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for three hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles does she run in 7 hours?

Answer: 25 miles.

Explanation:

Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she runs a total of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in the first 3 hours.

Then, she runs at 5 miles per hour for 7 - 3 = 4 hours, so she runs a total of 4 x 5 = 20 miles in the last 4 hours.

In total, Rosie runs 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours."

Julia was preparing for a party at her home, where she wanted to give away a pair of earrings. She realized she didn't have a pair of earrings, so she bought another pair. Later, her owner also bought 5 more bags of earrings for Julia. While Julia was preparing to give away earrings, three of the bags of earrings touched her ears. After she closed the door, she had 12 earrings. How many bags of earrings did Julia buy?

How many bags of earrings did Julia buy?

Answer: 4 bags.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

1. Julia had 12 earrings in total.
2. She bought another pair of earrings, so she had 13 earrings in total.
3. Later, her owner bought 5 more bags of earrings for Julia.
4. Three of the bags of earrings touched her ears.

Now, let's think about how many bags of earrings Julia had in total:

12 + 13 = 25 earrings (total)

Since three bags of earrings touched her ears, we can subtract 3 from the total number of earrings:

25 - 3 = 22 earrings (total)

Since Julia had 22 earrings in total, and each bag contains 5 earrings, we can divide the total number of earrings by the number of earrings in each bag:

22 ÷ 5 = 4 bags

Therefore, Julia bought 4 bags of earrings."

129	One hospital sees five hundred patients a day. One patient is seen every forty minutes. The doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital get from these visits?	10000	"Answer only. 
One hospital sees five hundred patients a day. One patient is seen every forty minutes. The doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital get from these visits?

Answer: The hospital gets a profit of $50 per visit.

Explanation:

1. One patient is seen every forty minutes, so there are 50 patients seen in an eight-hour day (8 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes / 40 minutes per patient = 50 patients).
2. The doctor charges $150 per hour, so the hospital charges $150 x 50 patients = $7,500 per day.
3. The hospital charges the patient $200 per hour, so the patient pays $200 x 50 patients = $10,000 per day.
4. The profit is the difference between what the hospital charges the patient and what the hospital pays the doctor: $10,000 - $7,500 = $2,500 per day.

Therefore, the hospital gets a profit of $2,500 per day from these visits."
130	Nissa hired sixty part-time workers to work as caterpillars at her factory in Santa's village.

Nissa hired sixty part-time workers to work as caterpillars at her factory in Santa's village. One-third of the caterpillars died when the children spat on them, and ten percent of the remaining caterpillars died when the children got down on their knees. How many caterpillars are left?

Answer: 30 caterpillars.

Explanation:

Let x be the number of caterpillars that died when the children spat on them.

Since one-third of the caterpillars died, we can write:

x = 30/3 = 10

So, 10 caterpillars died when the children spat on them.

Now, let y be the number of caterpillars that died when the children got down on their knees.

Since ten percent of the remaining caterpillars died, we can write:

y = 10/90 = 1/9

So, 1/9 of the remaining caterpillars died when the children got down on their knees.

Now, we can find the total number of caterpillars left:

30 + 1/9 = 30 + 0.11 = 30 + 1.1 = 31.1

So, there are 31.1 caterpillars left.

However, we can only have whole numbers, so the answer is:

30 caterpillars."

After Pam boarded two trains and Fred boarded four, each of them decided to stay on two boats. If each ticket cost six dollars, how many tickets were used that day?

Answer: 20 tickets.

Explanation:

Pam boarded two trains, so she used two tickets.
Fred boarded four trains, so he used four tickets.

Then, Pam stayed on two boats, so she used two more tickets.
Fred stayed on two boats, so he used two more tickets.

In total, Pam used two + two = four tickets, and Fred used four + two = six tickets.

Therefore, a total of six tickets were used that day."

Rory offers to give her two cruise ships for $7.50 each, two suitcases for $1.50, and two cats for $1.00 each for delivery. Twenty percent is added to the shipping cost and $5.00 is added. What will her organization buy?

Answer:

The total cost of the items is:

2 cruise ships x $7.50 = $15.00
2 suitcases x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cats x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Twenty percent of $20.00 is:

$20.00 x 20% = $4.00

Adding $4.00 to the total cost gives:

Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Therefore, Rory's organization will buy the two cruise ships, two suitcases, and two cats for $24.00."

Answer:

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions, so he could complete 75/8 = 9 questions per hour.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions, so he could complete 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour.

Since Mark completed 5 questions in one hour on the first test, he missed 75 - 5 = 70 questions.

On the second test, he missed 100 - 16.67 = 83.33 questions."

Kim has started her own housekeeping business, calculating her weekly income from her clients. She already has 3 clients, but talks to those who could be her top 5 clients, and feels confident to include them in her plan. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and one trash bag to be washed. Ntoa bleach costs $2 a bottle, and a suit costs about $5. These are the cost of slaves. She estimates her weekly income to be $92. The profit is the difference between total income and total expenditure, so how much profit would Lucas, in dollars, make per week?

This is a word problem, and we need to use math to find the answer. Here's how we can solve it:

1. First, we need to calculate the total income for the week. We know that Kim has 3 clients, and each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and one trash bag to be washed. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 3 x 2 = 6 bottles, and the total number of trash bags needed is 3 x 1 = 3 bags.
2. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies needed for the week. We know that each bottle of bleach costs $2, so the total cost of 6 bottles is 6 x $2 = $12. The total cost of 3 trash bags is 3 x $5 = $15.
3. Now, we can calculate the total income for the week. We know that each client pays $5 for each trash bag, so the total income from trash bags is 3 x $5 = $15. The total income from bleach is 6 x $2 = $12. Therefore, the total income for the week is $15 + $12 = $27.
4. Finally, we can calculate the profit for the week. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total cost of supplies. In this case, the profit is $27 - $12 - $15 = $10.

So, the answer to the question ""How much profit would Lucas, in dollars, make per week?"" is $"
145	John has a ten-hectare pumpkin patch. A hundred pumpkins grow on one hectare. John harvests his pumpkins every three months. How many pumpkins can John grow in a year?	4000	"Answer only. 
John has a ten-hectare pumpkin patch. A hundred pumpkins grow on one hectare. John harvests his pumpkins every three months. How many pumpkins can John grow in a year?

Please show your work and explain your reasoning.

Answer:

To find out how many pumpkins John can grow in a year, we need to calculate the number of harvests he can have in a year and then multiply that by the number of pumpkins he can grow per harvest.

John harvests his pumpkins every three months, which means he has four harvests in a year (4 x 3 = 12 months).

Since a hundred pumpkins grow on one hectare, John can grow 100 x 10 = 1,000 pumpkins per hectare.

Therefore, John can grow 1,000 x 4 = 4,000 pumpkins in a year."

The depth of the water in the cistern was about seventeen feet on Monday. On Monday, the water in the cistern was more than seven feet. On Wednesday, the water was two-thirds as deep as it was on Monday. How deep was the water in the cistern on Monday?

Answer: The water in the cistern was seventeen feet deep on Monday.

Explanation:
Let's start by using the information that the water was more than seven feet deep on Monday. This means that the water was at least seven feet deep, but it could be deeper.

We also know that on Wednesday, the water was two-thirds as deep as it was on Monday. This means that if the water was x feet deep on Monday, it was two-thirds x feet deep on Wednesday.

Since we know that the water was seventeen feet deep on Wednesday, we can set up the equation:

2/3x = 17

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

2x = 51

x = 25

So, the water in the cistern was twenty-five feet deep on Monday."

If the price of a bag of jewelry is $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then what is the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months?

Answer:

The price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months can be calculated as follows:

1. First month: $20 (original price)
2. Second month: $20 x 1.20 = $24 (20% increase)
3. Third month: $24 x 1.20 = $28.80
4. Fourth month: $28.80 x 1.20 = $34.56
5. Fifth month: $34.56 x 1.20 = $41.47
6. Sixth month: $41.47 x 1.20 = $49.76
7. Seventh month: $49.76 x 1.20 = $59.69
8. Eighth month: $59.69 x 1.20 = $71.62
9. Ninth month: $71.62 x 1.20 = $85.94
10. Tenth month: $85.94 x 1.20 = $101.13
11. Eleventh month: $101.13 x 1.20 = $121.36
12. Twelfth month: $121.36 x 1.20 = $145.64
13. Thirteenth month: $145.64 x 1.20 = $170.77
14. Fourteenth month: $170.77 x 1.20 = $206.12
15. Fifteenth month: $206.12 x 1.20 = $247.34
16. Sixteenth month: $247.34 x 1.20 = $298.82
17. Seventeenth month"
163	There are many kinds of toys in the room, including five red ones, three gold ones, and a pearl. The price of three gold ones and one red one is $4. If all the pearls are worth $5, how much are all the pearls worth?	50	"Answer only. 
There are many kinds of toys in the room, including five red ones, three gold ones, and a pearl. The price of three gold ones and one red one is $4. If all the pearls are worth $5, how much are all the pearls worth?

Answer: $25.

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the cost of three gold ones and one red one:

3 gold ones x $5 = $15
1 red one x $4 = $4
Total cost = $15 + $4 = $19

Now, let's calculate the cost of all the pearls:

5 red ones x $5 = $25
1 pearl x $5 = $5
Total cost of pearls = $25 + $5 = $30

Therefore, all the pearls are worth $30."

Jackie struggled to decide whether to pay her own bills or hire an accountant. If she paid her own bills, she could add 3 hours to her own work and lose $35/hour in unpaid wages. The accountant paid $90. If she did, how much money would she make?

Answer: $90.

Explanation: If Jackie pays her own bills, she will lose $35/hour in unpaid wages for 3 hours, which is $105. However, if she hires an accountant, she will pay $90. Therefore, the difference between the two options is $105 - $90 = $15. So, Jackie would make $15 by hiring an accountant."

Jessica tries to figure out how much money she will need to pay off all of her bills each month. Her monthly student loan payment is $300, her monthly credit card payment is $200, and her monthly mortgage payment is $500. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debt, how much will she pay off in a year?

Answer: $1,300

Explanation:
To pay off more than 50% of her debt, Jessica needs to pay off at least 50% of the total amount of her debt each year.

Total debt = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000

To pay off 50% of the total debt, Jessica needs to pay $1,000 x 0.5 = $500.

Therefore, Jessica will pay off $500 each year to pay off more than 50% of her debt."

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $3 and sugar for $2. They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for each bottle. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemonade?

Let x be the amount they spent on lemonade.

Since they sold each bottle for $0.50, they sold 20 bottles for $10.

They sold sugar for $2, so they spent $2 on sugar.

Their total revenue is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since they made a profit of $25, their total cost is $12 + x.

We want to find out how much they spent on lemonade, so we set up the equation:

12 + x = 25

Solve for x:

x = 13

So they spent $13 on lemonade."
176	In one race involving 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese and the rest were Chinese. If there were 60 men on the Chinese team, how many women were on the Chinese team?	100	"Answer only. 
In one race involving 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese and the rest were Chinese. If there were 60 men on the Chinese team, how many women were on the Chinese team?

I'm happy to help! Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. There were 240 Asians in the race.
2. 80 of them were Japanese.
3. The rest of the participants were Chinese.
4. There were 60 men on the Chinese team.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of women on the Chinese team.

Since we know that 80 of the participants were Japanese, that means there were 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese participants.

We also know that 60 of these Chinese participants were men, so there were 160 - 60 = 100 Chinese women in the race.

Therefore, there were 100 women on the Chinese team."

Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five and a half years older than Jan. If Jan is thirty, how old is Jean?

Answer: 32 years old.

Explanation:

Let Jean's age be x.

According to the problem, Mark is five and a half years older than Jan, so Mark's age is:

Mark's age = Jan's age + 5.5

Jan's age = 30

So, Mark's age = 30 + 5.5 = 35.5

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2

Jean's age = 35.5 + 2 = 37.5

Therefore, Jean is 37.5 years old."

Athletic teams compete in long distance events ranging from 4 meters to 400 meters; each team consists of four athletes who each run 400 meters, or one leg on a standard track. One of the two teams is an equal-sized team, with each athlete running approximately 55 laps. The other teams are not the same; the first athlete runs for 60 minutes, and then each of the runners runs 3 minutes faster than the first. Using these data, how many teams will be fastest?

Answer: 2 teams

Explanation:

The first team runs for 60 minutes, which is equivalent to 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds.

The second team runs for 60 minutes, but each athlete runs 3 minutes faster than the first team, so they run for:

60 minutes x 3600 seconds/hour = 3600 x 3 = 10800 seconds

The third team runs for 55 laps, which is equivalent to:

55 laps x 400 meters/lap = 22000 meters

The fourth team runs for 55 laps, but each athlete runs 3 minutes faster than the third team, so they run for:

22000 meters x 3 = 66000 meters

Now, we can compare the times of each team:

Team 1: 10800 seconds
Team 2: 66000 seconds
Team 3: 22000 meters
Team 4: 66000 meters

The fastest teams are Team 2 and Team 4, as they have the shortest time and the longest distance. Therefore, there are two fastest teams."

What is the probability (expressed as a percentage) that when he rolls a number greater than 3, he rolls the next two numbers of the same value?

Answer: 16.7%

Explanation:

To determine the probability that the man rolls the next two numbers of the same value when he rolls a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability that he rolls two numbers of the same value in a row.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling two dice:

1. (1,1)
2. (1,2)
3. (1,3)
4. (1,4)
5. (1,5)
6. (1,6)

Of these outcomes, only (1,2) and (1,3) have two numbers of the same value. Therefore, the probability of rolling two numbers of the same value in a row is:

P(same value) = (number of outcomes with same value) / (total number of outcomes)

P(same value) = (2) / (6) = 1/3

So, the probability that the man rolls the next two numbers of the same value when he rolls a number greater than 3 is:

P(next two numbers same) = P(rolling a number greater than 3) x P(same value)

P(next two numbers same) = (4/6) x (1/3) = 16.7%

Therefore, the probability that the man rolls the next two numbers of the same value when he rolls a number greater than 3 is 16.7%."

Answer: $2.67.

188	A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?

Let x be the number of sacks the merchant sells.

The total revenue the merchant receives is:

30x

The total cost of transporting the sacks is:

2x

The merchant's profit is:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= 30x - 2x
= 28x

Since the merchant makes a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:

28x = 400

Solve for x:

x = 400/28
= 14

So the merchant sells 14 sacks of beans."
189	Three friends bought 3 tickets to the party for $20.25, spent less than $4.50 on food, and paid $33 for two trips. If they could figure out how to split the money equally, how much would each of them pay?	34	"Answer only. 
Three friends bought 3 tickets to the party for $20.25, spent less than $4.50 on food, and paid $33 for two trips. If they could figure out how to split the money equally, how much would each of them pay?

Answer: Each of the three friends would pay $10.50.

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

$20.25 (ticket price) + $4.50 (food cost) + $33 (two trips) = $68

Since they spent less than $4.50 on food, we can subtract that amount from the total cost:

$68 - $4.50 = $63.50

Now, we can divide the total cost by three to find out how much each friend should pay:

$63.50 ÷ 3 = $21.17

Since each friend should pay an equal amount, we can round up to the nearest dollar to get:

Each friend pays $10.50."

It took John three hours to pick one fruit, so he was able to buy two in one minute.

How many fruits can John buy in one hour?

Please provide step-by-step solution.

Answer:

To find out how many fruits John can buy in one hour, we need to first find out how many fruits he can buy in one minute.

From the problem, we know that John can buy two fruits in one minute.

Now, we need to find out how many fruits he can buy in one hour.

There are 60 minutes in one hour, so:

2 fruits/minute x 60 minutes/hour = 120 fruits/hour

Therefore, John can buy 120 fruits in one hour."

192	Tom planted ten trees a year. Each year he harvested two trees a year. He started with fifty trees. Ten years later, thirty percent of the trees were dead. How many trees were left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom planted ten trees a year. Each year he harvested two trees a year. He started with fifty trees. Ten years later, thirty percent of the trees were dead. How many trees were left?

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Tom planted ten trees a year.
2. Each year, he harvested two trees.
3. He started with fifty trees.
4. Thirty percent of the trees were dead after ten years.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many trees were left after ten years.

We know that Tom planted ten trees a year, so he planted ten trees in the first year, and then he planted ten trees in the second year, and so on.

We also know that he harvested two trees each year, so in the first year, he harvested two trees, and in the second year, he harvested two trees, and so on.

We also know that he started with fifty trees, so after the first year, he had fifty - two = forty-eight trees left.

Now, let's think about what happens over the next nine years. Each year, Tom harvests two trees, so after the second year, he has forty-eight - two = forty-six trees left. After the third year, he has forty-six - two = forty-four trees left, and so on.

After ten years, Tom has harvested twenty trees (two trees each year for ten years), so he has forty-five - twenty = twenty-five trees left.

However, we are also told that thirty percent of the trees were dead after ten years. This means that three trees out of every ten trees were dead.

So, if Tom had forty-five trees left after ten years, then he had forty-five x 0.7 = thirty trees that were alive, and he had forty-five x 0.3 = ten trees that were dead.

Therefore, after ten years, Tom had thirty trees that were alive and ten trees that were dead, giving a total of forty trees left."

Mark is a copywriter. He writes a certain number of words per week for two publishers who each pay differently for each word. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as publisher A. Mark edits about 1,000 words per week, and Editor A pays him 5 cents per article. How much does Mark make per week, in cents?

Answer: 

(5 cents/word) x 1,000 words = 5,000 cents

5,000 cents / 2 (Publisher B pays twice as much) = 2,500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 2,500 cents per week."

John received a prize in the office. That prize consisted of 1 coin at a time when the prize amount was $5000 and the prize was increased by 5%. If he made 2000 coins, every coin in the year and received the prize on the first day of the year, how much money did he earn that year?

Let X be the number of coins John received.

Since the prize was increased by 5%, the prize amount after the increase is:

$5000 x 1.05 = $5250

If John received 2000 coins, then the total amount he earned is:

2000 x $5250 = $105,000

So John earned $105,000 that year."

He eats a cheese and egg omelet for breakfast 3 times a week, and uses one omelet more than he eats a loaf of bread. He made a large macaroni and cheese dish that he could eat on many nights a week, and he made it with 8 cheeses. How many chopped dishes did he use?

Can you help me solve this problem?

Answer: 

There are a few things that we can be sure of based on the information given:

1. Carl eats bread every day this week at noon.
2. He uses any kind of bread to make cheese.
3. He eats a cheese and egg omelet for breakfast 3 times a week.
4. He made a large macaroni and cheese dish that he could eat on many nights a week.

Answer: 
Janet has a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pencils.

After buying the bags of pencils, Janet has:

* 2 bags of red pencils with 9 pencils each = 2 x 9 = 18 red pencils
* 2 bags of red pencils with 10 pencils each = 2 x 10 = 20 red pencils

So, in total, Janet has 32 + 18 + 20 = 60 pencils."

Michael also enjoys horseback riding. He used to ride it about 5 times a week, covering 25 miles each time. He did this for four weeks, and then he decided to ride only 2 horses a week, but it was 60 miles each, and he did it every week. How many miles did Michael cover in total?

Answer:

To find out how many miles Michael covered in total, we need to calculate the total distance he rode in each of the four weeks and then add them up.

Week 1: 5 times a week x 25 miles per ride = 125 miles
Week 2: 5 times a week x 25 miles per ride = 125 miles
Week 3: 2 times a week x 60 miles per ride = 120 miles
Week 4: 2 times a week x 60 miles per ride = 120 miles

Total miles covered = 125 + 125 + 120 + 120 = 480 miles

Therefore, Michael covered a total of 480 miles."

Rose bought 4 cakes from the store on Monday. The next day she went to another store and bought 3 more cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 more cakes than she had made on Monday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?

Answer: 12 cakes

Explanation:

Day 1 (Monday): Rose bought 4 cakes.

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rose bought 3 more cakes, so she has a total of 4 + 3 = 7 cakes.

Day 3 (Wednesday): Rose bought 5 more cakes than she had made on Monday, so she bought 5 + 7 = 12 cakes.

Therefore, after all three days, Rose bought a total of 4 + 7 + 12 = 12 cakes."
209	Twenty of the twelve cups cost $1200, and a dozen of the small cups cost $6000. Imagine how much each cup would cost.	145	"Answer only. 
Twenty of the twelve cups cost $1200, and a dozen of the small cups cost $6000. Imagine how much each cup would cost.

Answer: 
To find out how much each cup would cost, we need to divide the total cost by the number of cups.

For the large cups:
$1200 ÷ 20 = $60 per cup

For the small cups:
$6000 ÷ 12 = $500 per cup

Therefore, each large cup would cost $60, and each small cup would cost $500."

Sara wants to buy a new bed and a pair of shoes. Her favorite bed costs $30 and each shoe costs $20. Sara's nanny pays for the baby 4 times, and she pays $5 for each time she babysits. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she walks in the woods. If Sarah saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many walks in the woods would she have to make before she could afford the bed and shoes?

Answer: Sarah would have to walk in the woods 3 times to earn enough money to buy the bed and shoes.

Explanation:

1. Sara saved $10 before she started babysitting.
2. She earns $4 for every walk in the woods.
3. She needs $30 for the bed and $20 for each shoe, for a total of $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.
4. To earn $70, she would have to walk in the woods 70/4 = 17.5 times.
5. Since she can't walk in the woods in fraction, she would have to walk 18 times.

So, Sara would have to walk in the woods 18 times to earn enough money to buy the bed and shoes."

Jerry has two lakes that each release 4 gallons of water per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big lake had twice as much water as the small lake. Now the big lake has four times as much water as the small lake. How much water does the small lake have now?

I need to know how to approach this problem. Please help!

Answer:

Let's say the small lake has x gallons of water.

Since the big lake had twice as much water as the small lake 4 minutes ago, the big lake had 2x gallons of water.

Now, the big lake has four times as much water as the small lake, so the big lake has 4x gallons of water.

We know that the total amount of water released from both lakes is 4 gallons per minute, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 4(4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4x = 16

Combine like terms:

6x = 16

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 2

So, the small lake has 2 gallons of water now."

Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and $32.00 matching belts. She works part-time and pays $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work to buy them?

Please use the formula:

Total Cost = (Price x Quantity) + Tax

Total Cost = ($320.00 x 1) + ($32.00 x 1) + Tax

The burrito costs $6.50. She adds the pasta, which costs $2.00, the cheese, which costs $1.00, the avocado, which costs $1.00, and two side dishes, which cost $0.25 each. She plans to make her meal more than $3.00 worth of chips and wine. If she had a $5.00 gift card, she could afford it. How much does she still owe?

Answer: She still owes $2.25.

To calculate this, we need to first calculate the total cost of her meal:

$6.50 (burrito) + $2.00 (pasta) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.25 (side dishes) = $11.75

Since she has a $5.00 gift card, she can afford $5.00 of the meal:

$5.00 - $11.75 = $2.25

Therefore, she still owes $2.25."

Kalinda and her mother were doing the same work as a 360-degree telescope. Kalinda could add 4 fractions of a minute to each. Her mother could add the number that Kalinda could add in a minute. How many hours would it take them to complete these questions?

I know that Kalinda could add 4 fractions of a minute to each, so she could add 4 x 60 = 240 minutes to each.

Her mother could add the number that Kalinda could add in a minute, so she could add 240 minutes to each.

So, together they could add 240 + 240 = 480 minutes to each.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so they could add 480 / 60 = 8 hours to each.

Therefore, it would take them 8 hours to complete the questions."
229	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30% of the apples were ready for harvest, so she brought them home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the apples were ready, so she harvested the apples. After two weeks, how many apples would be harvested?	21	"Answer only.

Answer: 30% of 30% of the apples = 9% of the apples.

9% of the apples = 30% of the apples = 30% of the total number of apples.

Therefore, 9% of the apples = 30% of the total number of apples."

Mark bought 12 of them for his company. They sold for $20,000 each. He paid 10% of the sales tax and $1000 for each title. How much did he pay for all of them?

Answer: $240,000

Explanation:

1. Calculate the total cost of all 12 vehicles:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

2. Calculate the sales tax:

10% of $240,000 = $24,000

3. Add the sales tax to the total cost:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

4. Calculate the title fees:

12 x $1000 = $12,000

5. Add the title fees to the total cost:

$264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $276,000 for all 12 vehicles."

236	Ram uses a lot of pencils. He figured out that if he could save money, he could use five blank pencils to make one pencil. If he bought 25 more pencils and then used them to make new pencils when the ink was exhausted, how many more pencils would he have?	31	"Answer only. 
Ram uses a lot of pencils. He figured out that if he could save money, he could use five blank pencils to make one pencil. If he bought 25 more pencils and then used them to make new pencils when the ink was exhausted, how many more pencils would he have?

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

1. Ram uses a lot of pencils.
2. He can make one pencil using five blank pencils.
3. If he bought 25 more pencils, he would have a total of 25 + 5 = 30 pencils.

Now, let's think about how many more pencils Ram would have if he used the 25 additional pencils to make new pencils when the ink was exhausted.

If he uses five blank pencils to make one pencil, then he would need five blank pencils for each new pencil he wants to make. Therefore, if he has 25 more pencils, he could make:

25 x 5 = 125 new pencils

Jason has a 1,000-minute standing-on-the-street-to-talk schedule every month. He spends fifteen minutes a day calling his boss, and this month he spends 300 minutes calling other people. If this month has thirty days, how many minutes does Jason have left?

Answer:

To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to subtract the total minutes he spends calling his boss and other people from the total number of minutes in the month.

Total minutes in the month = 1,000 minutes

Minutes spent calling his boss = 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes

Minutes spent calling other people = 300 minutes

Total minutes spent on calls = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Minutes left for the month = 1,000 - 750 = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month."

Jeans, a celebrity therapist, earns $250 per hour. She wanted to do a very expensive set for a film in which she played a character that would take six hours to shoot every day and needed to be shot every four weeks. The film would take five weeks to complete. After the film was finished, the celebrity photographer gave Jean a ten percent bonus for the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?

Answer: $12,500

Explanation:

To calculate the total amount paid to Jean, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day x 5 weeks = 30 days x 6 hours/day = 180 hours

Total amount paid = 180 hours x $250/hour = $45,000

Since the celebrity photographer gave Jean a ten percent bonus, we can calculate the bonus amount as follows:

Bonus amount = $45,000 x 10% = $4,500

Therefore, the total amount paid to Jean is:

Total amount paid = $45,000 + $4,500 = $49,500"

On Monday, Sue ate four times as much as her sister. On Monday, she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate five times as much on Monday, and the next day, she ate thirteen times as much. If a cat has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?

I'm trying to solve this problem but I'm having trouble understanding the information given. Could you please help me?

Thank you!

Answer:

Let's break down the information we have:

1. Sue ate four times as much as her sister on Monday.
2. Sue ate twice as much as her sister on Monday.
3. Her sister ate five times as much on Monday.
4. The next day, her sister ate thirteen times as much.

Now, let's think about what this information is telling us. If Sue ate four times as much as her sister on Monday, that means Sue ate 4x as much as her sister. And if Sue ate twice as much as her sister on Monday, that means Sue ate 2x + 4x = 6x as much as her sister.

But wait, there's more! We're also told that her sister ate five times as much on Monday. So, her sister ate 5x as much as herself.

Now, let's add everything up:

Sue ate 6x as much as her sister on Monday.
Her sister ate 5x as much as herself on Monday.

So, the total amount of food eaten by both sisters on Monday is:

6x + 5x = 11x

Now, we're told that the next day, her sister ate thirteen times as much. So, her sister ate 13x as much as herself on Tuesday.

But we're not done yet! We're also told that Sue ate the same amount of food on Tuesday as she did on Monday. So, Sue ate 6x as much food on Tuesday as she did on Monday.

Now, let's add everything up:

Sue ate 6x as much on T"
