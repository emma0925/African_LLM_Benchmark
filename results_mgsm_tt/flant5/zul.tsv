If each teacher teaches 2 times a day using a whiteboard for each lesson, how many times a day is the whiteboard cleaned? If each lesson is cleaned 3 times, how many times a day is the whiteboard cleaned? 4 teachers, so 4 * 2 = 8 teachers. If each teacher teaches 2 times a day using a whiteboard for each lesson, how many times a day using a whiteboard is the whiteboard cleaned? 8 teachers, so 4 * 4 = 8 teachers. If each teacher teaches 2 times a day using a whiteboard for each lesson, how many times a day using a whiteboard is the whiteboard cleaned? 8 teachers, so 4 * 4 = 8 teachers. If each teacher teaches 2 times a day using a whiteboard for each lesson, how many times a day is the whiteboard cleaned? 8 teachers, so 4 * 4 = 8 teachers. If each lesson is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times a day is the whiteboard cleaned? 8 teachers, so 4 * 4 = 8 teachers. If each lesson is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times a day is the whiteboard cleaned? 8 teachers, so 4 * 4 = 8 teachers.
