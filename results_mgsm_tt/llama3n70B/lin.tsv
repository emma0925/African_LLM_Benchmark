The rest, she will sell each day at the farmer's market, at a cost of $2 per new duck egg. How much (in dollars) will she earn each day at the farmer's market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day.
She eats 3, uses 4 for muffins, so she's left with:
16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

She sells each egg at $2, so she earns:
9 eggs × $2 = $18

1	One piece requires 2 rolls of blue fiber (cloth) and half a piece of white cloth. How many rolls in total?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi inani lezicelo zethu? (Let me calculate the total number of rolls for you.)

One piece needs 2 rolls of blue fiber and half a piece of white cloth. Half a piece of white cloth is equal to 1 roll, because 1 piece of white cloth is equal to 2 rolls.

Ngakho, inani lezicelo zethu izolo 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 rolls. (So, the total number of rolls is 3.)

2	Josh enters a home improvement business. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 to renovate it. The price of the house has gone up 150 percent. How much profit has he made?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Josh's profit.

Initial investment = $80,000 (buying the business) + $50,000 (renovation) = $130,000

The business value increases by 150%, so the new value is:
$130,000 x 2.5 (1 + 1.5) = $325,000

Profit = New value - Initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

Josh has made a profit of $195,000.

4	To keep his chickens healthy, Wendi gives them three tablespoons of mixed fruits, flour and vegetables every day. He serves them three separate meals. In the morning, he gives them 15 tablespoons of food. In the evening, he gives them 25 more. If his flock has 20 chickens, how many tablespoons of vegetables should he give them for the last meal of the day?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Wendi gives 3 tablespoons of food to each chicken, 3 times a day. So, the total amount of food per chicken per day is 3 x 3 = 9 tablespoons.

He has 20 chickens, so the total amount of food per day is 20 x 9 = 180 tablespoons.

In the morning, he gives 15 tablespoons, and in the evening, he gives 25 more. So, the total amount given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 tablespoons.

To find out how many tablespoons are left for the last meal, we subtract 40 from 180: 180 - 40 = 140 tablespoons.

Now, we need to find out how many tablespoons each chicken will get for the last meal. Since there are 20 chickens, we divide 140 by 20: 140 ÷ 20 = 7 tablespoons per chicken.

So, Wendi should give each chicken 7 tablespoons of vegetables for the last meal of the day.

5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all subsequent glasses are worth 60% off. Kylar wants 16 glasses. How much should she pay to buy them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola iphinde (Let me help you with that).

One glass costs $5, so the first glass is $5.

Subsequent glasses are 60% off, which means 40% of $5, which is $2.

Kylar wants 16 glasses, so she'll buy 15 glasses at $2 each, which is 15 x $2 = $30.

Add the first glass, which is $5, so the total is $30 + $5 = $35.

Kylar should pay $35 to buy 16 glasses.

6	Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 suburbs, how many suburbs are Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle?	260	"Jambo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 suburbs.
Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 suburbs.
Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 suburbs.

In total, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 suburbs.

7	Carla is uploading a 200 GB file. She can upload at a rate of 2 GB per minute but at 40% of the upload, Windows commands a restart to set updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla should start uploading from the beginning. How long does it take to upload the file?	160	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Carla uploads 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it takes to upload 200 GB, we divide 200 GB by 2 GB/minute:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, at 40% of the upload (0.4 × 200 GB = 80 GB), Windows commands a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Since Carla has to start from the beginning, she's already uploaded 80 GB, but it's like she hasn't uploaded anything yet.

So, we add the 20 minutes of restart time to the total upload time:

100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it will take Carla 120 minutes to upload the 200 GB file.

8	Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, and backtracks when he realizes that he has forgotten something valuable at home. He tries to drive for 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in the traffic jam. In the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph with 4 hours left. How far is it from his home at the end of 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. He backtracks, which means he drives back home, so he covers the same distance again:
Distance = 180 miles

3. He tries to drive for 4 hours but loses 2 hours in a traffic jam, so he drives for 4 - 2 = 2 hours. Let's assume he drives at the same speed (we're not given a new speed):
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

4. In the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

5. Finally, he drives at 80 mph for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 4 hours = 320 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 180 miles - 120 miles + 15 miles + 320 miles = 575 miles

So, Jean is 575 miles away from his home at the end of 4 hours.

9	For the first 40 hours of a week's work, Elisa's hourly rate is $10 per hour. For higher hours, she earns 1.2 times the hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours a week, what would her salary be?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Ukubonga kwesikhathi esingama-40, uElisa uyaphuma imali engu-$10 ngosuku. Uma esesele ukusebenza ngaphezulu, uyaphuma imali engu-1.2 times imali yakhe yosuku. Uma uElisa esebebenza ngamasuku amahlanu asixoxisana, imali yakhe iyiphi?

(For the first 40 hours of work, Elisa earns $10 per hour. For higher hours, she earns 1.2 times her hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours, what would her salary be?)

Ukucopheleleyo, uElisa uyaphuma imali engu-$10 ngosuku kusukela ku-40 usuku. Uma esebebenza ngamasuku amahlanu asixoxisana, uyaphuma imali engu-5 usuku ngaphezulu. Imali yakhe ngosuku ngaphezulu iyenguD-12. Uyaphuma imali engu-D-12 ngosuku ngaphezulu kusukela ku-5 usuku. Imali yakhe ngosuku ngaphezulu iyenguD-60.

(Calculating, Elisa earns $10 per hour for 40 hours. If she worked 45 hours, she earns 5 hours more. Her hourly rate for the extra hours is $12. She earns $12 per hour for the extra 5 hours. Her salary for the extra hours is $60.)

Imali yakhe yonke iyenguD-400 + D-60 = D-460.

(Her total salary is $400 + $60 = $460.)

10	The new average was 60 downloads in the first month. The rate of downloads in February was three times higher than in the first month. Then it dropped to 30% in March. How many times was the average average download in the last three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

January: 60 downloads
February: 3 times January = 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
March: 30% of January = 0.3 x 60 = 18 downloads

Total downloads in 3 months = 60 + 180 + 18 = 258
Average downloads in 3 months = 258 ÷ 3 = 86

So, the average average download in the last three months is 86.

11	Toula bought pastries. She went to the map store. She bought three dozen loaves of bread for $68 for a dozen, three dozen sweet cakes for $80 for a dozen, and six dozen sweet cheese cakes for $55 for a dozen. How much did everything cost?	694	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the cost:

* 3 dozen loaves of bread = 3 x $68 = $204
* 3 dozen sweet cakes = 3 x $80 = $240
* 6 dozen sweet cheese cakes = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $240 + $330 = $774

12	Carlos wants to plant a Lilala tree. The cost of planting is 90$. per year, the tree can grow from 7 apples which will be sold for 1.5$ each. Watering the tree costs 3$ per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit Carlos makes from the Lilala tree per year:

7 apples/year × $1.5/apple = $10.50/year

The total cost per year is:
$90 (planting) + $3 (watering) = $93/year

Since the profit ($10.50) is less than the cost ($93), Carlos is still at a loss.

In the second year, the profit remains the same, but the cost is only $3 (watering), since the planting cost is a one-time expense:
$10.50 (profit) - $3 (watering) = $7.50 (loss)

In the third year, the profit is still $10.50, and the cost is $3 (watering), so:
$10.50 (profit) - $3 (watering) = $7.50 (profit)

Carlos starts earning money from his Lilala tree in the third year.

13	Melanie works as a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, then sold two to the red house, then finally sold the rest to the orange house. If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners to the green house.
Then, she sold 2 to the red house.
Finally, she sold the rest to the orange house and was left with 5 vacuum cleaners.

Let x be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially.

She sold 1/3 of x to the green house, which means she had 2/3 of x left.
Then, she sold 2 more, leaving her with 2/3 of x - 2.
This equals 5, so we can set up the equation:

2/3x - 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides:

2/3x = 7

Then, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 21/2

x = 10.5

Since Melanie can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Melanie had 11 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.

14	In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of hip-hop dance students:

20% of 20 students = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students (contemporary dance)
25% of 20 students = 0.25 x 20 = 5 students (jazz dance)

Total students in contemporary and jazz dance = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Number of students in hip-hop dance = 20 - 9 = 11 students

Percentage of hip-hop dance students = (11/20) x 100% = 55%

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The percentage of hip-hop dance students is 55%.

15	A trader will be torn between two purchases: $5,000 worth of jewelry or $8,000 worth of electronic gadgets. His financial advisor predicts a 2.5% increase in the market for jewelry and a 1.2% increase in the market for electronic gadgets over the course of a month. If the trader chooses the one that will help him maximize profits at the end of the month, what is the interest rate?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukubonga kwesikhathi sokuthenga kukhona emakethe.""

Now, let's calculate the interest rate:

For jewelry: $5,000 x 2.5% = $125
For electronic gadgets: $8,000 x 1.2% = $96

The trader should choose the jewelry, which will give him a profit of $125. To find the interest rate, divide the profit by the initial investment:

Interest rate = ($125 ÷ $5,000) x 100% ≈ 2.5%

So, the interest rate is 2.5%."

17	Jill earns $20 an hour as a dance teacher and $30 an hour as a dance teacher for children. If she works 35 hours a week as a dance teacher, 15 hours a week as a dance teacher and 50 hours a week per year, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a dance teacher, Jill earns $20/hour and works 35 hours/week. That's $20 x 35 = $700/week.

As a dance teacher for children, Jill earns $30/hour and works 15 hours/week. That's $30 x 15 = $450/week.

Total weekly earnings: $700 + $450 = $1,150/week.

18	For her regular meal, Claire cooks 3 eggs at a time. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi umuntu uyakudla izi-3 eggs ngalokho. (I understand that she eats 3 eggs at a time.)

Ukuthola izi-dozen eggs, sizokwazi ukucophelela ngokuthi 1 dozen = 12 eggs. (To find the dozen eggs, we can calculate that 1 dozen = 12 eggs.)

Ngokuqhubeka, sizokwazi ukucophelela ngokuthi Claire uyakudla izi-3 eggs ngalokho. (Continuing, we can calculate that Claire eats 3 eggs at a time.)

Ngokuthi uyakudla izi-3 eggs ngalokho, sizokwazi ukucophelela ngokuthi uyakudla izi-21 eggs ngomsonto. (Since she eats 3 eggs at a time, we can calculate that she eats 21 eggs per week.)

Ngokuthi uyakudla izi-21 eggs ngomsonto, sizokwazi ukucophelela ngokuthi uyakudla izi-84 eggs ngama-4 weeks. (Since she eats 21 eggs per week, we can calculate that she eats 84 eggs in 4 weeks.)

Ngokuthi uyakudla izi-84 eggs ngama-4 weeks, sizokwazi ukucophelela ngokuthi uyakudla izi-7 dozen eggs ngama-4 weeks. (Since she eats 84 eggs in 4 weeks, we can calculate that she eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.)

19	Marissa has walked the longest distance of 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Marissa has walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

She wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles. Let's calculate the total time she should take:

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
= 12 miles / 4 mph
= 3 hours

She has already taken 2 hours to walk 6 miles, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked
= 12 miles - 6 miles
= 6 miles

To walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, she needs to walk at a speed of:

Speed = Remaining distance / Time left
= 6 miles / 1 hour
= 6 mph

So, Marissa should walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

20	I have 10 liters of apple juice made from 2 liters of water. I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made from 4 liters of water, with a soup. One liter of apple juice. How much water is in 24 liters of water?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Apple juice: 10 liters made from 2 liters of water, so the amount of water in 1 liter of apple juice is 2/10 = 0.2 liters.

You want to mix 1 liter of apple juice, which contains 0.2 liters of water.

Pineapple juice: 15 liters made from 4 liters of water, so the amount of water in 1 liter of pineapple juice is 4/15 = 0.267 liters.

You want to mix 24 liters of the juice, which is a combination of apple and pineapple juice. Let's assume the ratio of apple to pineapple juice is 1:23 (1 liter of apple juice and 23 liters of pineapple juice).

The amount of water in 1 liter of pineapple juice is 0.267 liters, so the amount of water in 23 liters of pineapple juice is 23 x 0.267 = 6.141 liters.

Adding the water from the apple juice (0.2 liters) and pineapple juice (6.141 liters), we get 6.341 liters of water.

So, in 24 liters of the mixed juice, there are approximately 6.341 liters of water.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50, with a 25% discount on the original price. What is the original price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price of the book.

If the discounted price is $19.50, and the discount is 25%, that means Kyle saved 25% of the original price.

Let's call the original price ""x"".

The discount amount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount amount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book is $26.00.

25	Marie ordered a bowl of chicken for $12, 5 cartons of potatoes for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and half a box of pizza. Marie ordered all 50 dollars. If a box of pizza costs $8.50, how much of the box did Marie order?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Marie's order:

* 1 bowl of chicken = $12
* 5 cartons of potatoes = 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples = 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total so far = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie spent a total of $50, so she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on the pizza.

If a box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 (but she didn't order a whole 2 boxes, since that would be $17, not $8.50)

So, Marie ordered 2 x 0.5 = 1 box of pizza.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Marie wathenga ibhokisi eliyi-1.5."" (Marie ordered 1.5 boxes of pizza.)

However, since you asked how much of the box she ordered, I'd say: ""Marie wathenga ibhokisi elinganiselwa ku-0.5."" (Marie ordered half a box of pizza.)"

Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

3 cups x $16.50 = $49.50
3 trousers x $22.50 = $67.50

29	While shopping for shoes, Gloria finds that the bottle leg is worth her money. So, she has to choose between the bottle and the top pair of shoes. They both cost five dollars less than the bottle. If one of the top pair of shoes costs $33 and the other is twice as much, what is, in dollars, the price of the bottle?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

One of the top pair of shoes costs $33, and the other is twice as much, so the other one costs $33 x 2 = $66.

Both top pairs of shoes cost $5 less than the bottle, so let's set up an equation:

$33 + $66 - $5 - $5 = bottle price

Combine like terms:

$99 - $10 = bottle price

$89 = bottle price

So, the price of the bottle is $89.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
30	Between Darell and Allen's ages, the difference is 7:11. If you add up their present ages to 162 years, how old will Allen be in 10 years?	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. The ratio of their ages is 7:11, so let's assume Darell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. We know their ages add up to 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide by 18:

x = 9

Now, Darell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"
31	Gunter tries to count the candies in his mouth. He asks his friends to guess the number. One of them answers 80. Another says 20 more than half of the previous one. The third says 25% more than the previous one. What is their average guess?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than 60, which is 60 + (25/100) × 60 = 60 + 15 = 75.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 75) / 3 = 215 / 3 = 71.67

So, their average guess is approximately 72.

Let's break it down:

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% of the extra points. That means he scored 25% of 20, which is 5 points (20 x 0.25 = 5).

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5. How much money is lost on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of yogurts for 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since 4 yogurts cost $5, the cost of 1 yogurt is $5 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

So, the cost of 60 yogurts is 60 x $1.25 = $75.

37	jean wants to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. he made 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. in total, he bought 8 video games for $20 each, which left him with $5. how many Lego sets did he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made:
13 x $15 = $195

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent:
8 x $20 = $160

He had $195 - $160 = $35 left, but the problem says he had $5 left, so he must have spent the remaining $30 on something else (not mentioned in the problem).

39	Dana will run four times faster than her normal walking pace, but will run twice as fast as her normal walking pace. If she runs at 3 miles per hour, how many miles has she run in six hours, given that she spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Dana runs at 3 miles per hour, which is twice her normal walking pace. So, her normal walking pace is 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spent 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance = Speed × Time

Distance run = 3 miles/hour × 2 hours = 6 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance = Distance run + Distance walked = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles

So, Dana has run a total of 12 miles in 6 hours.

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Suzie's iPhone is a generation older, so let's say it's 1 year old.
* Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's, so it's 2 years old.
* Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so it's 4 x 2 = 8 years old.

41	Perf, the great dragon sat on the slopes of Mount Garbo and began to spit on people at a distance of 1000 feet. Polly kept throwing the golden javelin, the only weapon that could split the dragon, but at a distance of 400 feet, the strongest of them fell on her. But, since Polly touched the sapphire stone, she kept falling three times farther away. When she touched the stone Talo, at what distance could Polly have stood if she hadn't fallen far away, and caught the dragon with the golden javelin?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Polly fell 3 times farther away each time she touched the sapphire stone. Since the strongest of them fell on her at a distance of 400 feet, she would have fallen 3 x 400 = 1200 feet away.

But she didn't stop there. She touched the stone again, so she fell 3 times farther away again. That's 1200 x 3 = 3600 feet away.

Finally, she touched the Talo stone. So, she fell 3 times farther away again. That's 3600 x 3 = 10,800 feet away.

Now, if she hadn't fallen far away, she would have stood at a distance of 10,800 feet from the dragon. That's where she could have caught the dragon with the golden javelin.

42	Mrs. Jones's grandmother cooked five cookies with apples for the murderers' breakfast. Then she dressed the cookies individually in eight pieces. She spread the cookies on the dining table so that each person could have their own portion. In the evening, after the guests had eaten the cookies, there were 14 left. How many guests ate the cookies?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* 5 cookies x 8 pieces each = 40 pieces
* 40 pieces - 14 left = 26 pieces eaten
* Since each guest had their own portion, the number of guests is 26.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There were 26 guests who ate the cookies."
43	In terms of nutritional information, one bag of potato chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300 g bag of potato chips has 5 servings, how many grams of potato chips would you eat, given that	48	"Odi nma! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's break it down: if one bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories, then the total calories in the bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.

Since the bag weighs 300g, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of one serving:

300g ÷ 5 servings = 60g per serving

So, if you eat one serving, you'll consume 60g of potato chips!"

Let's break it down:

* 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles and costs $10.00.
* Silk a sali PE sold 20 candles, so he used 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.
* The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.
* He sold 20 candles at $2.00 each, so his revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.
* His total profit is revenue - cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Let's calculate:

Candice had 80 pencils initially.
She bought some more, and now she has 220 pencils.
To find out how many she bought, subtract 80 from 220: 220 - 80 = 140
But wait, there are 23 pencils left, so subtract 23 from 140: 140 - 23 = 117

So, iphekete lamapenseli alimthola ilingana naliphi? (The packet of pencils she bought is equal to 117!)"
47	Jean will buy twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties are 50% more expensive. He spent $200 for a blue tie at $40 each. What did he spend on the tie?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean bought blue ties at $40 each and spent $200, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue ties

Since he'll buy twice as many red ties, he'll buy:

5 x 2 = 10 red ties

Red ties are 50% more expensive, so each red tie costs:

$40 x 1.5 = $60

He spent on red ties:

10 x $60 = $600

Adding the cost of blue ties:

$600 + $200 = $800

Jean spent $800 on ties.

Let's break it down:

15 floors x 8 apartments per floor = 120 apartments in total

3/4 of the building is occupied, so 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 is vacant

1/4 of 120 apartments = 30 apartments are vacant

50	Lloyd owns a chicken farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day and he sells them for $2 a dozen. How much does Lloyd make a week from his eggs?	294	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much Lloyd makes a week from his eggs.

Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he gets:

252 eggs/day × 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since he sells them for $2 a dozen, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he sells:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings:

147 dozens/week × $2/dozen = $294/week

Lloyd makes $294 a week from his eggs.

51	Tom's boat is traveling at 10 miles per hour. It will sail from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., and make its way back at 6 miles per hour. How long does it take him to get back?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tom's boat travels at 10 miles per hour from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., which is 3 hours. Distance = Speed x Time, so distance traveled = 10 x 3 = 30 miles.

On the way back, the boat travels at 6 miles per hour. To find the time, we use Time = Distance / Speed. Time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

52	Uriah's bag becomes too heavy for him. He has to reduce its weight by 15 pounds. Each cartoon weighs 1/4 of a pound and each of his toys is 1/2 of a pound. If he removes 30 cartoons, how many toys does he have to remove?	15	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's break it down:

Uriah needs to reduce the weight by 15 pounds. He removes 30 cartoons, each weighing 1/4 pound, so that's a total of 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds removed.

He still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy is 1/2 pound, so he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

The author put in more money, how much money did the car manufacturer make?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of money the car manufacturer made:

On Thursday:
6 tires on a large car = 6 x $60 = $360
4 tires on a small car = 4 x $40 = $160
Total on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday:
12 tires on a small car = 12 x $40 = $480
No large cars repaired, so $0

Total amount made = $520 + $480 = $1000

How many children does the Doubtfire family have now?	40	"Ndi Igbo m! (That's ""Let's do it in Igbo!"" for non-Igbo speakers)

Let's break it down:

* The Doubtfires have a 7-year-old adopted son, so they have 1 child already.
* Patchy has three times as many children as the one they adopted, which means Patchy has 3 x 1 = 3 children.
* Trixie has 12 children.
* In total, the Doubtfire family now has 1 (their adopted son) + 3 (Patchy's children) + 12 (Trixie's children) = 16 children.

57	A truck that is about to cross a wooden bridge cannot carry a load of more than 5,000 pounds. The truck is loaded with the same number of boats, for a weight of 15 pounds each. The weight of the driver in an open truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boats can the truck carry in order not to exceed the weight of the bridge?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry:

5,000 pounds (maximum weight) - 3,755 pounds (driver's weight) = 1,245 pounds (available weight for boats)

Since each boat weighs 15 pounds, let's divide the available weight by the weight of each boat:

1,245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/boat = 83 boats

So, the truck can carry 83 boats without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.

Stéphane gave PE a water bill of 4.00$. counting the top price, what is the final price of Stéphane's order?	57	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* The final price was $40.00.
* PE added 25% of the invoice price, which is $40.00 x 0.25 = $10.00.
* PE added $3.00 to the delivery price, making it $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.
* Stéphane gave PE a water bill of $4.00.

Now, let's calculate the final price:

$40.00 (initial price) + $13.00 (delivery price) + $4.00 (water bill) = $57.00

So, the final price of Stéphane's order is $57.00.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Izindleko zokugcina zikaStéphane ziyizimali eziyi-$57.00."" (The final price of Stéphane's order is $57.00.)"
59	A single framboisier has 6 grapes of 20 berries each. It has 67 berries. The berries stop spreading on the tree. How many framboisiers are there in all?	187	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukubonga ukuthi ungathola inkinga. (I want to thank you for giving me a problem.)

Let's break it down:

* 1 framboisier has 6 grapes, each with 20 berries, so 1 framboisier has 6 x 20 = 120 berries.
* But we're told it has 67 berries, so it's not a full framboisier.
* To find out how many framboisiers there are, we can divide the total number of berries (67) by the number of berries per framboisier (120).

67 ÷ 120 = 0.558 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 0.558 framboisiers. Since we can't have a fraction of a framboisier, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

Kutheni, kune-faramboisier eyodwa. (Therefore, there is one framboisier.)

Let's break it down:

Janet spent $500 on fabrication materials and $800 on a jeweler, so she spent a total of:

$500 + $800 = $1300

Then, she spent 10% of that on insurance. To find 10% of $1300, multiply by 0.1:

$1300 x 0.1 = $130

Add the insurance cost to the total:

$1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet spent a total of $1430.

Let's break it down:

After 20 years, Marcy is entitled to 5% of her annual salary, which is $50,000. 5% of $50,000 is:
$50,000 x 0.05 = $2,500

This means her annual salary increases by $2,500. So, her new annual salary after 20 years is:
$50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena pays $140/month, so she pays:
$140/month × 6 months = $840

For the rest of the year (6 months), the price increases by 10%, so the new price is:
$140/month × 1.10 = $154/month

For the remaining 6 months, Aleena pays:
$154/month × 6 months = $924

In total, Aleena pays:
$840 + $924 = $1764

Eziokwu! (That's ""True!"" in Igbo.) At the end of the year, Aleena will pay $1764 for the streaming service."
64	Sophie would like to travel by car. She would like to know how far she can carry a tank of gas in one car. She has traveled 100km since filling the tank. She has added 4 gallons of gas to refill the tank. The manual says that the tank has a capacity of 12 gallons of gas. How many kilometers can Sophie carry a tank of gas?	300	"Ekaabo! (Hello!)

Oriki Sophie! (Blessings to Sophie!)

Let's calculate how many kilometers Sophie can carry a tank of gas.

Since Sophie has traveled 100km with 12 - 4 = 8 gallons of gas, we can set up a proportion to find the total distance she can travel with a full tank:

100km / 8 gallons = x km / 12 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

100km × 12 gallons = 8 gallons × x km

1200 km = 8x km

x km = 1200 km ÷ 8

x km = 150 km

So, Sophie can carry a tank of gas for approximately 150 kilometers.

E se! (That's it!)"
65	Jim spends 2 hours watching TV, then decides to go to bed reading for half an hour. He does it 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 0.5 hours reading, so in total, he spends 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week, he spends 2.5 hours/day × 3 days/week = 7.5 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, he spends 7.5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 30 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Answer: 30 hours."
66	Each school sent a women's team and a men's team, which consisted of five basketball players. Each school sent two coaches to each school. The selectors of the schools sent ?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Abaqaphi bazikole bazithumela abacoachi ababili kuqembu ngalinye.

Translation: Each school sent two teams, one for women and one for men, with five players each. Each school sent two coaches per team.

So, the answer is: 2 coaches per team, and there are 2 teams per school, so 2 x 2 = 4 coaches per school."
67	A treasure hunter dug up a chest full of gems. It contained 175 diamonds, 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds, and twice as many emeralds as rubies. How many gems were in the chest?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 175 - 35 = 140
* Emeralds: 2 x 140 = 280

Adding them up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There were 595 gems in the chest.

68	There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down. If there are twice as many boys as girls, that means the number of boys is 2 x 60 = 120. 

So, the total number of students is 120 + 60 = 180. 

If there are 5 students per teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to get the number of teachers: 180 ÷ 5 = 36. 

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. 

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"
69	Bailey had half the money at the beginning. She then received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. If she reached $100 in total by the end of the 8th week, how much money did Bailey start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Bailey received $5 for 8 weeks, so she got a total of $5 x 8 = $40.

She ended up with $100, so she must have had $100 - $40 = $60 at the beginning.

Since she had half the money at the beginning, she must have started with $60 / 2 = $30.

70	During the week, Judy gives 5 dance lessons daily and 8 lessons on Saturdays. If a class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money will she make per week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Daily lessons: 5 lessons/day × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1125/day
Since there are 6 weekdays, total weekday earnings = $1125/day × 6 days = $6750

Saturday lessons: 8 lessons × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1800

Total weekly earnings = $6750 + $1800 = $8550

73	Sheila bought five swimming trunks at a cost of $150 each, to be paid in 3 months. Interest of 2% will be paid on each one. How much does it cost Sheila to be paid in 1 month for 3 months?	255	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ibuhlakani! (I'm happy to help you with the calculation!)

Let's break it down:

Sheila bought 5 swimming trunks at $150 each, so the total cost is:
5 x $150 = $750

The interest rate is 2% per month, and she wants to pay in 1 month instead of 3 months. To find the total interest, we'll calculate the interest for 2 months (since she's paying 2 months early):
$750 x 2% x 2 = $30

So, the total amount Sheila needs to pay in 1 month is:
$750 (principal) + $30 (interest) = $780

Ngiyabonga ukuthola ibuhlakani! (You're welcome for the calculation!)"
74	Artie sells flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three kinds of flowers: sausages, petunias, and begonias. He sells a lot of sausages for $2.74 a pot, petunias for $1.87 a pot, and begonias for $2.12 a pot. He doesn't have any money. Today, Artie has the opportunity to increase it to the dollar amount of the whole penny. If he sells 12 pots of sausages, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he get?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of money Artie will get:

Sausages: 12 pots x $2.74 = $32.88
Petunias: 9 pots x $1.87 = $16.83
Begonias: 17 pots x $2.12 = $36.04

Adding them up: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $85.75

Artie will get $85.75.

76	Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. according to the veterinarian, she should give 1 tablespoon of food EVERY day to feed the dog EVERY day for the first 180 days. then she should give 2 bags of food EVERY day until the end of her life. If one bag of food is 110 bags, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia gives 1 tablespoon of food per day. Since 1 bag = 110 tablespoons, she'll use:

180 days × 1 tablespoon/day = 180 tablespoons
180 tablespoons ÷ 110 tablespoons/bag = 1.64 bags (approximately)

After 180 days, she'll give 2 bags of food per day. There are 185 days left in the year (365 - 180 = 185). So, she'll use:

185 days × 2 bags/day = 370 bags

In total, Cecilia will use approximately 1.64 + 370 = 371.64 bags of dog food in the first year.

77	Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara. PE Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David. last summer Sara made 400 pounds of laundry, which is the difference between the amount of Raymond's laundry and David's laundry	100	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola ukuphendula kuqondiso lakho!

Let's break it down:

1. Sara does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if David does x pounds of laundry, Sara does 4x pounds.
2. Sara made 400 pounds of laundry last summer, so 4x = 400. Divide both sides by 4 to get x = 100. So David did 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sara, so Raymond did 2 * 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.
4. The difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is 800 - 100 = 700 pounds.

So, ukuphendula kuqondiso lakho (the answer to your question) is:

David did 100 pounds of laundry, Sara did 400 pounds, and Raymond did 800 pounds."
78	Vicent has to choose between the 3rd pack of flowers for $2.50 or the 2nd pack of flowers for $1. How much money would he save if he bought 18 flowers at the right price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

If Vicent buys the 2nd pack of flowers for $1, he would save $1.50 per pack compared to the 3rd pack of flowers for $2.50.

To find out how much he would save if he bought 18 flowers, we multiply the amount he saves per pack by 18:

$1.50 per pack x 18 packs = $27.00

So, Vicent would save $27.00 if he bought 18 flowers at the right price.

80	Two girls receive for each head 1/6 of 24 liters of water. A boy receives then 6 liters of water. How many liters of water remain?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two girls receive 1/6 of 24 liters each, so each girl gets:
24 liters × 1/6 = 4 liters
Since there are two girls, they receive a total of:
4 liters × 2 = 8 liters

A boy receives 6 liters of water, so in total, they've received:
8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

To find out how many liters remain, subtract the total received from the original amount:
24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

Kusho ukuthi! (That's it!) 10 liters of water remain."

Let's break it down:

Charlie had 10 stickers initially.
He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
He got 23 more for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He gave 28 to decorate his greeting card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

82	Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than Grace by 4 kilograms. What is, in pounds, the weight of both of them?	623	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than Grace, which means Alex weighs 2 kg less than 125 pounds. First, let's convert 125 pounds to kilograms: 1 pound is approximately 0.45 kilograms, so 125 pounds is approximately 125 x 0.45 = 56.25 kilograms.

Now, Alex weighs 2 kilograms less than 56.25 kilograms, which is 56.25 - 2 = 54.25 kilograms.

To find Alex's weight in pounds, we convert 54.25 kilograms back to pounds: 54.25 kg x (1 pound / 0.45 kg) = approximately 120.55 pounds.

So, the weight of both of them is 125 pounds (Grace) + 120.55 pounds (Alex) = 245.55 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Azo goes on vacation every 23 years, and she's gone 4 times. That means she's been traveling for 4 x 23 = 92 years.

Since each year of travel is represented by one square, Azo has 92 squares of clothes.

Today, Azo is 34 years old, and each year of her life is also represented by one square. So, she has 34 squares from her life.

In total, Azo has 92 (travel) + 34 (life) = 126 squares of clothes.

Let's break it down:

Two-fifths of 200 CM2 students are boys, so the number of boys is:
(2/5) × 200 = 80 boys

Two-thirds of 200 CM2 students are girls, so the number of girls is:
(2/3) × 200 = 133.33 (let's round up to 134 girls, since we can't have a fraction of a student)

Now, let's find the number of girls who are not scouts. Since all girls are either scouts or not scouts, we can set up an equation:
Number of girls - Number of girl scouts = Number of girls who are not scouts

We know the total number of girls (134), but we don't know the number of girl scouts. Let's call it ""x"". Then:
134 - x = Number of girls who are not scouts

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact number of girls who are not scouts. We need more data about the number of girl scouts.

She decides that tomorrow, she will get 1 plant in a pot from a window sill to give to her neighbors. How many plants in a pot will Marie get?	58	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Marie had 18 new plants and already had 2 window sills with plants, so she had a total of 18 + 2 = 20 plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 plant to her neighbors, so she will be left with 20 - 1 = 19 plants.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Marie uzothola amaplanthi ayi-19."" (Marie will have 19 plants.)"
100	One day, four friends come to see Jerome. The first rings the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opens it, the second rings the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first, and the third rings the doorbell 10 times as many times as the fourth. Assuming that the fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times, how many times does the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times.
* The third friend rings the doorbell 10 times as many times as the fourth, so 10 x 60 = 600 times.
* The second friend rings the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first, and the first rings it 20 times. A quarter of 20 is 5, so the second friend rings it 5 times.
* Now, let's add up the number of times the doorbell rings: 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685 times.

Kushaya, ngithi! (That's it, my friend!) The doorbell rings 685 times."
101	He has to read 4 pages of a science textbook, 20 pages of a social studies textbook, 7 pages of a history textbook and 8 pages of a geography textbook. This time, he has read 15 pages. If he has 4 days left to finish reading, how many pages does he have to read every day?	6	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of pages he needs to read:

4 pages (science) + 20 pages (social studies) + 7 pages (history) + 8 pages (geography) = 39 pages

He has already read 15 pages, so he has:

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages left to read

He has 4 days left to finish reading, so he needs to read:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Kutheni, uyaqonda! (That's it, you understand!)"
102	Jean likes to drink a glass of water at lunch, lunch and dinner. To finish, she drinks one before going to bed. She follows this routine every day of the week. On Saturdays, she likes to have fun and drink a soda at dinner. How many glasses of water does Jean drink in a week?	26	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Let's count"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Jean drinks 3 glasses of water per day from Monday to Friday, and 4 glasses on Saturday (including the soda at dinner). So, let's count:

Monday to Friday: 3 glasses/day × 5 days = 15 glasses
Saturday: 4 glasses
Total: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses of water per week.

(Translation: I want to find out how long it takes for the fog to cover the entire 42-mile distance. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. Therefore, to find out how long it takes for the fog to cover the entire 42-mile distance, I should calculate that it will take 140 minutes.)"
104	Poppy tries to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the tray, then her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces. How many pieces of the puzzle are left to put together?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy starts with 1,000 pieces. She puts a quarter (1/4) of them on the tray, which is:

1,000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces

So, 250 pieces are on the tray, leaving:

1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining

Then, her mother puts a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces, which is:

750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces

Now, 250 more pieces are on the tray, leaving:

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Therefore, 500 pieces of the puzzle are left to put together.

Siyabonga! (Thank you!)"

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 x 6 x 4 inches long. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total volume of the 3 boxes?	72	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the volume of one box first. The inner dimensions are 5 - 2 = 3 inches wide, 6 - 2 = 4 inches long, and 4 - 2 = 2 inches high. So, the volume of one box is 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume is 3 x 24 = 72 cubic inches.

Ngicela ukuthi ngikunikeze ingxoxo! (I hope that helps!)"
107	Every night, Frankie watches TV after doing his homework. Since last Tuesday, he watches one hour episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watches more episodes of the 30-minute show. Thursday has finished his homework earlier and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. Friday doesn't go to bed early for Saturday, so he watches two one-hour episodes each. If he watches a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Tuesday: 1 hour = 2 x 30 minutes
* Wednesday: x x 30 minutes (we don't know how many yet)
* Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 2 x 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 3 x 30 minutes
* Friday and Saturday: 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours = 8 x 30 minutes

Total TV time: 7 hours = 14 x 30 minutes

Now, let's add up the minutes:

* Tuesday: 2 x 30 minutes = 60 minutes
* Thursday: 3 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes
* Friday and Saturday: 8 x 30 minutes = 240 minutes

Total minutes: 60 + 90 + 240 = 390 minutes

We know the total TV time is 7 hours = 14 x 30 minutes = 420 minutes. So, we subtract the minutes we already know:

420 - 390 = 30 minutes

That means Frankie watched 1 x 30 minutes on Wednesday.

108	Henri is baking cookies for the national pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the baking, he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than he should have. He cuts down 5 biscuits during the cooling process and is left with a total of 110 biscuits. How many biscuits did Henri bake last year?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Let x be the number of cookies Henri baked last year.

Henri wants to make twice as many as last year, so he makes 2x cookies.

He finds that he has made 15 more cookies than he should have, so he has 2x + 15 cookies.

During the cooling process, he cuts down 5 biscuits, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

He is left with a total of 110 biscuits, so 2x + 10 = 110.

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 110 - 10
2x = 100
x = 50

So Henri baked 50 biscuits last year!

109	One service station sells gasoline for $3.00 per gallon. The app company offers a $0.20 refund per gallon if you fill up at that station. If one person buys 10 gallons of gasoline, what will the purchase price be, after the refund?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the purchase price:

10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Refund: 10 gallons x $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Purchase price after refund: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

110	Marcell and Béatrice compete to see which of them eats the most fruit rolls. The behavior is as they were there. Unfortunately, by mistake, Béatrice gets two large rolls and 24 long rolls, but Marcell gets three large rolls and 14 long rolls. If they all eat their rolls, how many eat the rolls inside?	45	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's count the rolls:

Béatrice has 2 large rolls and 24 long rolls, so she has a total of 2 + 24 = 26 rolls.

Marcell has 3 large rolls and 14 long rolls, so he has a total of 3 + 14 = 17 rolls.

In total, they have 26 + 17 = 43 rolls.

So, if they all eat their rolls, they will eat 43 rolls inside.

111	There was a leak in Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat began to take two liters of water in ten feet of running to the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to walk twenty feet. The shore is 64 seconds, how much water did the boat take when Julia reached the shore?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* The boat takes 2 liters of water in 10 feet of running.
* Julia walks 20 feet in 16 seconds.
* To find out how many feet she walks in 64 seconds, we can multiply: 20 feet/16 seconds = x feet/64 seconds. Solving for x, we get x = 80 feet.
* Since the boat takes 2 liters of water in 10 feet, it will take 2 liters/10 feet = x liters/80 feet. Solving for x, we get x = 16 liters.

So, when Julia reaches the shore, the boat will have taken 16 liters of water.

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"

114	Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's. Brittany's phone can store a maximum of 50 times more than the birds in the photos taken by Jamal, where we can see the clouds in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many clouds can we see in the photo he took?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos.
Brittany's phone can store 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos.
The birds in the photos taken by Jamal are 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

So, in the photos taken by Jamal, we can see 6 birds with clouds in the zoo.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Siyabonga! (Thank you!) Kunezihlobo 6 ezitholakala emaphotweni akhe Jamal, lapho sibuka izulu ezoopark."" (There are 6 birds visible in Jamal's photos, where we see the clouds in the zoo.)"
115	After buying timber for a while, Sasha finds that the price has gone up by 50% in the last month. She decides to sell the remaining timber. There are ten remaining 2 x 4 x 10 boards, giving her a price of $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 a piece. If she can sell them, what will her profit be?	90	"""Odi nke a! (That's good!) Let's calculate Sasha's profit.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she has 10 pieces at $10 each, so she'll make 10 x $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she has 5 pieces at $16 each, so she'll make 5 x $16 = $80.

Total revenue is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the price has gone up by 50%, she'll sell them for 150% of the original price. Let's calculate her cost:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she bought them at 2/3 of the current price, so 2/3 x $10 = $6.67 each. She has 10 pieces, so her cost is 10 x $6.67 = $66.70.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she bought them at 2/3 of the current price, so 2/3 x $16 = $10.67 each. She has 5 pieces, so her cost is 5 x $10.67 = $53.35.

Total cost is $66.70 + $53.35 = $120.05.

Her profit is Total Revenue - Total Cost = $180 - $120.05 = $59.95.

Sasha's profit is $59.95. Odi nke a! (That's good!)"""
116	Katy is cooking coffee using 7 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water in the ratio of 7:13. Do a calculation of how many cups of coffee she has left, knowing that she has used a total of 120 cups of sugary coffee and a cup of water.	42	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The ratio of sugary coffee to water is 7:13, so for every 7 cups of sugary coffee, Katy uses 13 cups of water. To find the total number of cups, we add 7 + 13 = 20 cups.

Since Katy used a total of 120 cups, we can divide 120 by 20 to find the number of times she used the ratio: 120 ÷ 20 = 6 times.

Now, let's calculate the total cups of sugary coffee used: 6 × 7 = 42 cups.

To find out how many cups of sugary coffee Katy has left, we subtract the used cups from the total: 120 - 42 = 78 cups.

So, Katy has 78 cups of sugary coffee left.

118	The customs officer at the main SeaSide customs clearance port has 2 containers of vehicles for entry, there are five containers in each. The next day, new containers arrive and a total of 30 vehicles are in port. Calculate the number of containers for entry on the second day, assuming that each container has 5 vehicles.	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On the first day, there are 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

On the second day, a total of 30 vehicles are in port. To find the number of vehicles that arrived on the second day, subtract the initial 10 vehicles from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, divide the number of vehicles that arrived on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 containers.

So, there are 4 containers for entry on the second day.

119	Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, this salary increased by a whopping 40% from what he started receiving. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased by one hour, and Adrien received $40,000 for four years, calculate the total amount of their salary after four years.	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let Lylah's initial salary be x.

Adrien's initial salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so Adrien's initial salary is x + 0.3x = 1.3x.

After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is 1.3x + 0.4(1.3x) = 1.82x.

We know Adrien received $40,000 for four years, so his new annual salary is $40,000 / 4 = $10,000.

Since his new salary is 1.82x, we can set up the equation:

1.82x = $10,000

To find x, we divide both sides by 1.82:

x = $10,000 / 1.82
x ≈ $5,495

So Lylah's initial salary is approximately $5,495.

Now, let's find Lylah's new salary after four years. Since her salary increased by one hour, we can assume her salary also increased by 40% (similar to Adrien's increase).

Lylah's new salary is x + 0.4x = 1.4x ≈ 1.4($5,495) ≈ $7,693.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of their salary after four years:

Adrien's new salary: $10,000
Lylah's new salary: $7,693
Total salary: $10,000 + $7,693 ≈ $17,693

Let's break it down:

Morissette carried 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she carried a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael carried twice as many apples as Morissette, so he carried 2 x 5 = 10 apples.

Kael carried half as many oranges as Morissette, so he carried 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

In total, Kael carried 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together, they carried 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

124	Jennie is going to help out in her mother's office. She has a stack of 60 stamps and another stack of stamps. She put a stamp on one-third of the stamps. If there are now 30 stamps in a stack of stamps, how much was in the stack when Jennie started working?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Jennie put a stamp on one-third of the stamps, which means she used 1/3 of the total stamps.

She started with 60 stamps in one stack and another stack. After using 1/3 of the stamps, there are 30 stamps left in one stack.

Let's call the number of stamps in the other stack ""x"". The total number of stamps is 60 + x.

Since Jennie used 1/3 of the stamps, the number of stamps left is 2/3 of the total. We can set up the equation:

2/3(60 + x) = 30 + 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2/3(60 + x) = 60

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

2(60 + x) = 180

Expanding the equation, we get:

120 + 2x = 180

Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get:

2x = 60

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 30

So, there were 30 stamps in the other stack when Jennie started working.

125	Julia is getting ready for the sandwich she has prepared for her, when she was going to serve the ragout. She realizes that she no longer has a plastic pan and buys a new packet of pancakes. Later, her husband buys another packet of 5 new pancakes and gives them to Julia. During cooking, Julia uses three pancakes to taste the ragout. Later, when she goes to put them on the table, she has 12 pancakes. How many pancakes were in the packet that Julia bought?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Julia buys a new packet of pancakes, let's call it x.
Her husband buys another packet of 5 new pancakes, so now Julia has x + 5 pancakes.
She uses 3 pancakes to taste the ragout, leaving her with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 pancakes.
Later, she has 12 pancakes, so we set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.
Solving for x, we get: x = 10.

So, Julia bought a packet of 10 pancakes.

Let's break it down in Swahili:

Mama wa Wells anauza matunda ya tikiti, kichaa, na matofaa kwenye dukani la mtaa. Tikiti moja inagharimu mara tatu ya tikiti moja, na matofaa moja inagharimu mara tano ya tikiti moja. Dillon ametumwa dukani kununua matofaa manne, kichaa 20, na matofaa 10. Jibu ni kiasi gani cha pesa atakachotumia kama bei ya tikiti moja ni $15?

(Bei ya tikiti moja ni $15, bei ya matofaa moja ni $15 x 5 = $75, bei ya kichaa moja ni $15 / 3 = $5)

Dillon atakachotumia $75 x 10 = $750 kwa matofaa, $5 x 20 = $100 kwa kichaa, na $15 x 4 = $60 kwa matunda ya tikiti. Jumla ni $750 + $100 + $60 = $910.

The hospital charges $150 per hour, so the total revenue would be 4000 hours/day * $150/hour = $600,000 per day.

If the hospital charges $200 per hour outside, the total revenue would be 4000 hours/day * $200/hour = $800,000 per day.

The interest charged by the hospital would be the difference between the two revenue amounts: $800,000 - $600,000 = $200,000 per day.

So, the hospital would charge $200,000 in interest for these consultations."
130	Nissa has hired 60 seasonal players to play the violin in Santa's village in her department store. One third of the violinists quit after the children waved them up, then 10 violinists quit because the children put their feet in the iron. How many violinists are left?	30	"Elo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Nissa started with 60 violinists.
One third of 60 is 20, so 20 violinists quit.
Then, 10 more violinists quit.
That's a total of 20 + 10 = 30 violinists who quit.

To find the number of violinists left, we subtract 30 from 60:
60 - 30 = 30

So, 30 violinists are left.

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""Oriki omo olorun, 30 ni awọn olorin ti wa!"" (Praise be to God, 30 violinists are left!)"
131	In May, Joseph's spending went up to $500. It went down to $60 in June. How much money did he lose in two months?	940	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Joseph wayesekile imali engangeni $500 kusasa, futhi wayeseka imali engangeni $60 kusasa. Kutheni imali ayilahlekile ukuthi? (Let me calculate how much money Joseph lost. He spent $500 in May and $60 in June. So how much money did he lose?)

Imali ayilahlekile ukuthi = $500 - $60 = $440.

Kutheni Joseph wayilahlekile imali engangeni $440 emasontweni amabili. (So Joseph lost $440 in two months.)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi ukuphakama! (I hope that helps!)"
132	Pam and Fred go to a carnival. Pam does 2 laps of the roller coaster and Fred does 4 laps. Then they do 2 laps of the sled. If one lap costs 6 tickets, how many tickets were used that day?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of tickets used:

Pam did 2 laps of the roller coaster, and Fred did 4 laps, so together they did 2 + 4 = 6 laps. Then, they did 2 laps of the sled together, so that's 6 + 2 = 8 laps in total.

Since one lap costs 6 tickets, they used 8 x 6 = 48 tickets that day.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
133	On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as Monday. His Monday-Wednesday mileage was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as Monday, so 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
His Monday-Wednesday mileage was 41 miles.

Let's add Monday and Tuesday's miles: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
To find Wednesday's miles, subtract the total from Monday-Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday!

135	Brian's friend, Bobby, has 5 video games less than 3 times the number of Brian's video games. If Brian has 20 video games but loses 5 just before the initial test, how much does Bobby have?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Brian has 20 video games, but loses 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left.

Bobby has 5 video games less than 3 times the number of Brian's video games. So, 3 times Brian's video games is 3 x 15 = 45.

Bobby has 5 video games less than that, so 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

136	There are only 27 unicorns left in the world. One third of them are found in the Highlands of Scotland. Two thirds of Scottish unicorns are females. How much is a Scottish unicorn worth?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1/3 of 27 unicorns are in Scotland, so there are 27 ÷ 3 = 9 unicorns in Scotland.
* 2/3 of Scottish unicorns are females, so there are 9 × 2/3 = 6 female unicorns in Scotland.

Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide information about the worth of a Scottish unicorn. It only gives us the number of unicorns. So, I can't give you a specific answer to that question.

But I can say ""Ngiyabonga"" (thank you) for the interesting math problem!"
137	Rory calls 2 submarines for $7.50 each, 2 packets of fries for $1.50 each and 2 biscuits for $1.00 each. The 20% deposit is paid in cash and Rory adds a tip of $5.00. How much is the deposit fee?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

2 submarines = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 packets of fries = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 biscuits = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Adding the tip = $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00

The 20% deposit is = $25.00 x 0.20 = $5.00

So, the deposit fee is $5.00.

138	Yesterday, Marc took a test of 75 questions. He did it in the form of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions in the same way. If Marc took 8 hours to do the first test and 6 hours for the second, how many questions remain unanswered?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday, Marc took 75 questions in 8 hours, doing 5 questions per hour. So, he answered 5 x 8 = 40 questions.

Today, he took 100 questions in 6 hours, still doing 5 questions per hour. So, he answered 5 x 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Marc answered 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

There are 75 + 100 = 175 questions in total. Since he answered 70, there are 175 - 70 = 105 questions remaining unanswered.

139	In a candy machine, there are 22 times as many blue gummy bears as there are four times as many pink gummy bears. If there are 12 blue gummy bears, how many are pink?	70	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Okay!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

* There are 12 blue gummy bears.
* There are 22 times as many blue gummy bears as there are four times as many pink gummy bears.
* So, if we divide 12 by 22, we get the number of groups of four times as many pink gummy bears: 12 ÷ 22 = 0.545 (let's call this x).
* Since there are four times as many pink gummy bears in each group, we multiply x by 4 to get the number of pink gummy bears: 0.545 × 4 = 2.18. Let's round down to 2, since you can't have a fraction of a gummy bear!

O di mma! (That's ""It's good!"" in Igbo.) There are 2 pink gummy bears."
140	Of the 20 rental cars, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars and the rest are semi-automatic cars. What is the percentage of semi-automatic cars?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars: 20 (total) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 (semi-automatic)

Kusho ukuthola! (That's correct!) The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
141	There are 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ezintathu ku-700 (There are 700 bees in the hive)

Kunezinhlanhla ezintathu ezinhlanu ezinhlakeni, kunezinhlanhla ezimbili ezinhlanu ezinhlakeni (There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees and queen bees)

Kumele siphinde siphinde ukucophelela (Let's calculate)

Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ezintathu ku-700 (There are 700 bees in the hive)

Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ezintathu ezinhlakeni = x (Let the number of baby bees and queen bees be x)

Kunezinhlanhla ezimbili ezinhlanu ezinhlakeni = 2x (Then the number of worker bees is 2x)

x + 2x = 700 (Set up the equation)

3x = 700 (Combine like terms)

x = 233.33 (Divide by 3)

Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ezintathu ezinhlakeni = 233 (Number of baby bees and queen bees is 233)

Kunezinhlanhla ezimbili ezinhlanu ezinhlakeni = 2(233) = 466 (Number of worker bees is 2 times 233, which is 466)

Kunezinhlanhla ezimbili ezinhlanu ezinhlakeni ku-466 (There are 466 worker bees)

142	Jordan spends 2 hours a day playing video games. His part-time job earns him $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make per week, if his game time was spent at work?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much Jordan would make per week if he spent his gaming time working.

Jordan spends 2 hours a day playing video games, which means he would work 2 hours a day instead. Since he earns $10 an hour, his daily earnings would be:

2 hours/day × $10/hour = $20/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly earnings would be:

$20/day × 7 days/week = $140/week

So, Jordan would make $140 per week if he spent his gaming time working.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
143	Jean bought for $2 the land, $3 the eggs, $3 the light bulb, $3 the cup and $4 the rat trap. Knowing that a 10% tax is imposed on all these non-food items, how much does each cost?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Ilanda (land) = $2 (no tax, it's a food item)
* Amazinyo (eggs) = $3 (no tax, it's a food item)
* Isibani sesihlizi (light bulb) = $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
* Ikhekhe (cup) = $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
* Isigcwelegcwele (rat trap) = $4 + (10% of $4) = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

144	Kim has set up her own cleaning company and has calculated the profit she can make from her clients. She has only 3 clients, but her conversations with 5 other clients will give her the peace of mind to do her calculations. 2 bottles of Javel and a packet of soap would be good for cleaning each client's home. It would cost $2 for a bottle of soap and $5 for a packet of soap. That's her total cost. She has calculated that her weekly profit would be 92 $. The profit is the difference between the total profit and the total cost, what profit, in dollars, would Kim make per week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Kim has 3 clients, and she's expecting 5 more, so she'll have a total of 8 clients.

For each client, she needs 2 bottles of Javel and 1 packet of soap. So, for 8 clients, she'll need:

* 2 x 8 = 16 bottles of Javel
* 1 x 8 = 8 packets of soap

The cost of 1 bottle of Javel is not given, so let's assume it's x.

The total cost would be:
16x + 8 x $2 (soap) = 16x + 16
The total cost would also be:
16x + 8 x $5 (soap) = 16x + 40

Kim's weekly profit is $92, which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. Let's set up an equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
Total Revenue - (16x + 40) = 92

Since the total revenue is not given, let's assume it's y. Then:

y - (16x + 40) = 92

To find the profit per client, we need to find the total revenue (y) and the total cost (16x + 40). Unfortunately, there's not enough information to find these values. However, we can express the profit per client as:

Profit per client = (y - 16x - 40) / 8

If you can provide more information about the total revenue or the cost of Javel, I'd be happy to help you find the profit per client!

Ukuba uyabonga ngosuku olunezinyanga ezi-4 (every 3 months), Jean uyabonga izimpineapple ezi-4000 (1000 pineapples x 4 harvests per year) ngonyaka.

Kuyafana ukuthi Jean uyabonga izimpineapple ezi-4000 ngonyaka. (It means Jean will harvest 4000 pineapples per year.)

146	Johnny picked up the remaining toys in his bedroom. He dropped a 500-piece Lego set, one with 3 times the number of pieces, and the last one with 1/4 of the number of pieces. How many of the pieces did Johnny pick up?	2,125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 500-piece Lego set
* One with 3 times the number of pieces = 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces
* The last one with 1/4 of the number of pieces = 500 / 4 = 125 pieces

Add them up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces

Johnny picked up 2125 pieces!

147	Debra watches the hive to see how many bees come in and out during the day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours, and sees half come back in the next 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees as those who left the hive the first time. Then, in the next 6 hours, all the bees that left and hadn't yet returned come back to the hive. How many bees did Debra see come back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
* Half of 30 (15 bees) come back in the next 6 hours.
* In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as those who left the first time come in, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.
* In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left and hadn't yet returned come back. That's 30 (initially left) - 15 (came back) = 15 bees.

So, Debra saw 15 bees come back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Let's break it down:

Charlie has 3 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends.

Jacques has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, and Dorothy has 4 friends. So, Jacques has 4 × 4 = 16 friends.

150	Steve and Tim decided to see which of them would be the fastest back to school. Steve lives farther away than Tim and is able to use his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and skips at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the rider to reach him before the rider finishes the race?	4	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Hello"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's break this down step by step:

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet away.
Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet away.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Steve to cover his distance:

Steve skips at 440 feet per minute, so to cover 15,840 feet, it will take him:
15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Tim to cover his distance:

Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so to cover 10,560 feet, it will take him:
10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve will reach Tim before Tim finishes the race. To find out how long it will take Steve to reach Tim, we need to find the time when Steve has covered the distance between them.

The distance between Steve and Tim is the difference between their distances from the school:
15,840 feet - 10,560 feet = 5280 feet

At Steve's speed of 440 feet per minute, it will take him:
5280 feet / 440 feet/minute = 12 minutes

to cover this distance.

So, it will take Steve 12 minutes to reach Tim before Tim finishes the race.

151	Shawnda thinks that a bike air conditioning service would be good for the kids in her neighborhood. She chooses to charge by the tire. All tire air conditioning costs 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people came to air two tires on each of their bikes. 3 people came to air the tires on their tricycles. Finally, one person came on a monocycle. How much money did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 people with 2 tires each = 5 x 2 = 10 tires
* 3 people with 3 tires each = 3 x 3 = 9 tires
* 1 person with 1 tire = 1 tire

Total tires = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Each tire costs 25 cents, so:
20 tires x 25 cents = 500 cents

There are 100 cents in 1 dollar, so:
500 cents ÷ 100 = 5 dollars

Shawnda made 5 dollars that day!

152	Carl bought ten packs of cookies. Each packet contains six cookies. Each cookie costs 0.10 $. How much money will Carl get if he leaves the $10 page?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Carl has 10 packs of cookies, each with 6 cookies. So, he has a total of 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6.

If Carl leaves with $10, he'll have $10 - $6 = $4 left.

153	Dave buys a large packet of French fries and eats fourteen before a hungry gull steals the packet from his hand. When the gull stops, he drinks half of the amount of French fries Dave has eaten. Then the three pigeons are expelled from the meal and can eat three French fries for each pigeon. Then the rabbit steals the remaining two-thirds of the French fries. The ants eat the last one, leaving five French fries. How many French fries were in the packet when Dave bought it?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* Dave eats 14 French fries.
* The gull eats half of 14, which is 7 French fries.
* The 3 pigeons eat 3 French fries each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.
* The rabbit steals 2/3 of the remaining French fries. Let's call the total number of French fries x. Then, the remaining French fries after Dave and the gull are x - 14 - 7 = x - 21. The rabbit steals 2/3 of this, which is 2/3(x - 21).
* The ants eat 1 French fry, leaving 5 French fries.

We can set up the equation:

x - 21 - 2/3(x - 21) - 9 - 1 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 21 - 2x/3 + 14 - 9 - 1 = 5
x - 2x/3 = 22
x/3 = 22
x = 66

So, there were 66 French fries in the packet when Dave bought it.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three one-hour classes per day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has two one-hour classes per day. If there are 16 weeks of school per semester, how many hours does Kimo devote to her classes per semester?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 classes/day × 3 days/week = 9 classes/week
Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 classes/day × 2 days/week = 4 classes/week
Total classes/week = 9 + 4 = 13 classes/week
Since each class is 1 hour, total hours/week = 13 hours/week
In 16 weeks, total hours = 13 hours/week × 16 weeks = 208 hours

Kimo devotes 208 hours to her classes per semester.

155	Every day Bill bakes 300 buns, 120 chocolate croissants and 60 baguettes. The buns are 4 inches long each, the croissants are 6 inches long each and the baguettes are 2 feet long each. If Bill puts all the bakery items one after the other, how many feet long would they be?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 300 buns x 4 inches each = 1200 inches
* 120 croissants x 6 inches each = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes x 2 feet each = 120 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Add them up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, convert inches to feet: 3360 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the bakery items one after the other, they would be 280 feet long.

157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to play on a 100-yard football field. Blake makes 15 passes. Kelly makes one pass, and decides he doesn't want to run next to Blake anymore. He starts making passes and ends up on the 40-yard line. He does it 34 times. How many yards does the winner pass the bench?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Blake makes 15 passes on a 100-yard field, so he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly makes 1 pass, which is 100 yards, and then ends up on the 40-yard line. So, he covers a distance of 100 - 40 = 60 yards in that pass.

Then, he makes 34 more passes, each covering 60 yards, so he covers an additional distance of 34 x 60 = 2040 yards.

In total, Kelly covers a distance of 100 + 2040 = 2140 yards.

Since Kelly covers more distance, he is the winner. To find out how many yards he passes the bench, we need to subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2140 - 1500 = 640 yards.

So, the winner passes the bench by 640 yards.

160	One pool is 17 feet deep on Monday. On Tuesday, the pool is 7 feet deeper. Wednesday's water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. How deep is the pool on Wednesday?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, the pool is 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it's 7 feet deeper, so 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.

On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth, which is 2/3 × 24 = 16 feet deep.

So, on Wednesday, the pool is 16 feet deep.

161	Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippos and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 hippos less than Anakin and 2 clownfish more than Anakin. How many fish did they both catch?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 hippos
3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
5 starfish less than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 hippos less than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3 hippos
2 clownfish more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Total fish caught by both:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total: 19 + 13 = 32

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) They caught 32 fish in total."
162	If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuphenduka kwale ngxenye. (Let me help you with that calculation.)

 Ukuba iphaketi lamarandi alingana $20, futhi iphakamiso lokuqala liyaphansi ngokushesha ngama-20% ngosuku olulodwa, ngabe iphaketi lamarandi lizokuba yini eminyakeni engama-36?

(Let's break it down: if the bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every 2 days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?)

Ukuthola ukuphenduka, sizokuthola ukuthola ukuphakamisa ngokushesha ngama-20% ngosuku olulodwa. (To get the increase, we'll calculate the 20% increase every 2 days.)

 Ngosuku olulodwa, iphakamiso lokuqala liyaphansi ngama-20%, okuthola ukuthi iphaketi lamarandi lizokuba ngama-$24. (In 2 days, the starting price increases by 20%, which means the bag of bills will cost $24.)

 Ngosuku olulodwa olulodwa, iphakamiso lokuqala liyaphansi ngama-20% ngama-$24, okuthola ukuthi iphaketi lamarandi lizokuba ngama-$28.80. (In another 2 days, the starting price increases by 20% of $24, which means the bag of bills will cost $28.80.)

 Sizokuthola ukuthola ukuphakamisa ngokushesha ngama-20% ngosuku olulodwa, ngosuku olulodwa olulodwa, ngosuku olulodwa olulodwa,... (We'll continue calculating the 20% increase every 2 days, every 2 days, every 2 days,...)

 Ukuba sithola ukuthola ukuphenduka ngama-36 iminyaka, sizokuthola ukuthi iphaketi lamarandi lizokuba ngama-$15,407.41. (If we calculate the increase for 36 months, we'll find that the bag of bills will cost $15,407.41.)

 Ngicabanga ukuthi ukuphenduka kwale ngxenye kuyahluka ngokuthi iphaketi lamarandi lizokuba ngama-$15,407.41 eminyakeni engama-36. (I think the answer to this question is that the bag of bills will cost $15,407.41 in 36 months.)

163	A lot of toys live in the same house: 5 red cars, 3 dolls and a doll. A doll costs 3 dolls, and a red car costs 4 dolls. Knowing that a doll costs 5 dollars, what is the total value of the toys?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 red cars = 5 x 4 dolls = 20 dolls
* 3 dolls + 1 doll = 4 dolls
* Total dolls = 20 dolls + 4 dolls = 24 dolls
* 1 doll costs 5 dollars, so 24 dolls cost 24 x 5 dollars = 120 dollars

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The total value of the toys is 120 dollars.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
164	Jackie is wondering if she should file her own taxes or hire an accountant. By doing so, she could work 3 hours as a freelancer per month, which would mean a loss of $35 per hour. The accountant would charge her $90. How much more would she make if she hired someone?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the difference:

If Jackie files her own taxes, she loses 3 hours of freelance work, which means a loss of 3 hours x $35/hour = $105.

If she hires an accountant, she pays $90, but she can work those 3 hours and earn $105.

So, the difference is $105 - $90 = $15.

If Jackie hires an accountant, she would make $15 more.

165	For her 30th birthday, Elvira chooses as a gift a new computer with many accessories. She has €1,500 donated to the whole family and thinks she can save some money to buy clothes. She goes to a computer store and chooses an expensive device for €1,090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also buys a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left to buy clothes?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

€1,090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1,423

Elvira had €1,500 donated to her. If she spends €1,423, she'll be left with:

€1,500 - €1,423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left to buy clothes.

170	Fanfare calls for new uniforms. All uniforms have jackets for $25 each, a jacket costs three times as much as a jacket, and trousers cost half as much as a jacket and a jacket. What is the total cost of a uniform?	150	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A jacket costs $25.
* A jacket costs three times as much as a jacket, so it's 3 x $25 = $75.
* Trousers cost half as much as a jacket and a jacket, so it's ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

The total cost of a uniform is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Let's break it down:

* Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8, so Sally Four is also 8.
* Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 8 x 2 = 16.
* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19.

So, the ages of the four birds are:

* Sally Two: 19
* Granny Red: 16
* Sally Four: 8

173	Jessica is wondering how much she should pay each month to pay off all of her debts. The minimum student loan payment is $300 per month, the credit card payment is $200 per month and the mortgage payment is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much should she pay per year?	18000	"Sawubona Jessica! (Hello Jessica!)

Let's calculate the total minimum payment per month:
$300 (student loan) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000 per month

To pay 50% more, multiply the total by 1.5:
$1000 x 1.5 = $1500 per month

To find out the annual payment, multiply by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000 per year

174	Billy is grinding and cutting a banana to make a banana salad for the big family barbecue. Since it's a big deal, he has 60 banana to grill. The bananas are roughly the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to grind and cut. It takes Billy one and a half minutes to grind a banana, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How many hours does it take Billy to finish cooking the banana?	95	"Odi nma! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's break it down:

Time to grind 1 banana = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut 1 banana = 0.083 minutes (5 seconds = 0.083 minutes)

Total time to grind and cut 1 banana = 1.5 + 0.083 = 1.583 minutes

Billy has 60 bananas, so total time to grind and cut all bananas = 60 x 1.583 = 95 minutes

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so total time in hours = 95 / 60 = 1.583 hours

Odi nma, Billy will finish cooking the banana in approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes!"
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on ice cream and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on ice cream?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

They sell 20 glasses at $0.50 each, so they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

They make a profit of $25, so their total revenue is $25 + (cost of ice cream + cost of sugar) = $25 + ($3 + $2) = $30.

Since they make $10 per gallon, they must have sold 3 gallons (30 / 10 = 3).

They spend $3 on ice cream per gallon, so they spent 3 x $3 = $9 on ice cream.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
176	In one race involving 240 Asians, 80 of them were Japanese and the rest Chinese. If the number of boys in the Chinese team was 60, how many girls were in the same team?	100	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukubonga!""

Now, let's solve the problem:

There were 240 Asians, with 80 Japanese. So, the number of Chinese is:
240 - 80 = 160

The number of boys in the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract:
160 - 60 = 100

So, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ematheni wesifazane!"" (There are 100 girls in the team!)"
177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his rent, 1/3 for his car fuel and gives the rest of the money to charity. He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly meals and $700 to his wife for household food. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending and donating?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Zaid earns $6,000 a month.
* He spends 1/4 on rent, which is $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500.
* He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000.
* He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, which is $200 + $700 = $900.
* Total amount spent is $1,500 + $2,000 + $900 = $4,400.
* The rest goes to charity, so the amount left is $6,000 - $4,400 = $1,600.

178	Rani has ten crabs more than Monique, she has 4 crabs less than Bo. Knowing that Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs.	122	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Bo has 40 crabs.
Rani has 4 crabs less than Bo, so Rani has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 crabs more than Monique, so Monique has 36 - 10 = 26 crabs.

Total number of crabs = Bo's crabs + Rani's crabs + Monique's crabs
= 40 + 36 + 26
= 102 crabs

181	Sandra, the florist, is not pleased with the imperfect delivery made by Fred. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 calla lilies of roses, which is five times the number of white carnations. Sandra plans to change supplier if the missing red roses are not delivered before 5 p.m. In order to keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver before 5 p.m.?	160	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo! (I love getting explanations!)

Let's break it down:

* Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Then, the number of red roses is 4x.
* She also ordered 200 calla lilies, which is 5 times the number of white carnations. So, 200 = 5x. To find x, divide both sides by 5: x = 200 ÷ 5 = 40.
* Now that we know x, we can find the number of red roses: 4x = 4(40) = 160.
* But Fred didn't deliver all the red roses. To keep Sandra as a customer, Fred needs to deliver the missing red roses. Let's assume he delivered some, but not all. If he delivered y red roses, then y < 160. To find the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver, subtract y from 160: 160 - y.

Since we don't know the exact number of red roses Fred delivered, we can't give an exact answer. However, we can say that Fred needs to deliver 160 - y red roses before 5 p.m. to keep Sandra as a customer.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Fred kufanele adlie 160 - y amarose aphakeme ngaphambi kwesihloko 5 p.m. ukuthola ukuthola Sandra njengomkhahleli."" (Fred needs to deliver 160 - y red roses before 5 p.m. to keep Sandra as a customer.)"
182	Jean is two years older than Marc. the last two years, Marc was five years older than Jan. If Jean is 30 years old, how old is Jean?	23	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean is 2 years older than Marc.
Last 2 years, Marc was 5 years older than Jan.
Jean is currently 30 years old.

Let's work backwards:

2 years ago, Jean was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
2 years ago, Marc was 28 - 2 = 26 years old (since Jean is 2 years older than Marc).
2 years ago, Jan was 26 - 5 = 21 years old (since Marc was 5 years older than Jan 2 years ago).

Now, let's add 2 years to find their current ages:

Jean is 30 years old (given).
Marc is 26 + 2 = 28 years old.
Jan is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

So, Marc is 28 years old.

185	Jenna and her mother ate apples from the farm. jenna ate two small plates of apples from her mother. if her mother ate 20 of them, how many apples would they both eat	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jenna ate 2 small plates of apples from her mother. Assuming each small plate has the same number of apples, let's call that number ""x"". So, Jenna ate 2x apples.

Her mother ate 20 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both ate, we add the number of apples Jenna ate (2x) to the number of apples her mother ate (20).

Total apples = 2x + 20

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since Jenna took apples from her mother, the total number of apples they both ate should be equal to the total number of apples from the farm. Let's call the total number of apples from the farm ""y"".

We know that Jenna took 2 small plates of apples from her mother, which means her mother had y - 2x apples initially.

Since her mother ate 20 apples, we can set up the equation:

y - 2x = 20

Now, we need to find the value of x. Let's assume each small plate has 5 apples (this is just an assumption, as the problem doesn't specify the exact number). So, x = 5.

Now we can find the total number of apples they both ate:

Total apples = 2x + 20
= 2(5) + 20
= 10 + 20
= 30

So, they both ate 30 apples.

186	Russell works in the organ house and divides the grass into organs. The mice divide the 3 parts of the house into a set of equal size and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. There is also a rabbit yard where they divide 20 parts of grass. No grass is used outside the store. If 160 parts of grass are divided into smaller parts, how many mice are in each house?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

* Russell divides the grass into organs, but we don't need that info for now.
* The mice divide the 3 parts of the house into equal sets, and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. This means there are 3 parts of the house, and each part has 6 parts of grass, so there are 3 x 6 = 18 parts of grass in the house.
* There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. This means the other 9 houses have the remaining 160 - 5 - 18 - 20 = 117 parts of grass.
* Since there are 9 houses, each house has 117 ÷ 9 = 13 parts of grass.
* Each mouse gets 6 parts of grass, so there are 13 ÷ 6 = 2 mice in each house.

So, there are 2 mice in each house.

187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed on a 2% monthly interest rate. If Mandy can pay this amount at the end of 3 months, how much should she pay Benoit?	106	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi... (I understand that...)

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a 2% monthly interest rate. To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months.

Interest for 1 month = $100 x 2% = $2
Interest for 3 months = $2 x 3 = $6

Total amount Mandy should pay = $100 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $106

Kusho ukuthi Mandy kufanele abhalele Benedict $106. (So Mandy should pay Benedict $106.)

188	A merchant buys half a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. Assuming that taking a sack from the field to the warehouse costs $2 and all the sacks are sold for $30 a sack for a total profit of $400, how much did the sacks sell for?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) buys half a sack for $20, which means uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) buys one sack for $40.

Ukuthatha isack kusuka ekhempasini (cost of taking a sack from the field to the warehouse) is $2, so uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) pays $42 for one sack.

Uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) sells all the sacks for a total profit of $400, so let's calculate the selling price:

Total profit = Selling price - Total cost
$400 = Selling price - ($42 x number of sacks)

Let's assume uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) sells x sacks.

$400 = 30x - 42x
$400 = -12x
x = 400 / 12
x = 33.33 (let's round it up to 34 sacks)

Now, let's find the selling price:

Selling price = $30 x 34
Selling price = $1020

Uma ngumthengisi (the merchant) sold the sacks for $1020.

Let's break down the costs:

* Entrance tickets: $20.25
* Food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
* Snowboard tours: 2 x $33 = $66
* Total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split the cost equally, each friend would pay:

191	bats need 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects do you need per day to survive a pack of ten bats?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's do the math, my friend!

If one bat needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, that's:

3.5 pounds ÷ 7 days = 0.5 pounds of insects per day per bat

For a pack of ten bats, you'd need:

0.5 pounds/day × 10 bats = 5 pounds of insects per day!

So, to survive a pack of ten bats, you'd need 5 pounds of insects per day!"
192	Tom plants 10 seeds a year. He cuts PE 2 seeds a year. He starts with 50 seeds. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead. How many seeds are left?	91	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Tom plants 10 seeds a year, so in 10 years, he'll have planted 10 x 10 = 100 seeds.

He cuts 2 seeds a year, so in 10 years, he'll have cut 2 x 10 = 20 seeds.

He starts with 50 seeds, so after 10 years, he'll have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 seeds.

But 30% of the seeds are dead, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 seeds.

So, the number of seeds left is 130 - 39 = 91 seeds.

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"
193	Sue lives in a neighborhood where it's beautiful. One Saturday, the neighbors decide to make a joke of her. Friday morning, they put 18 plastic pink flamingos in her garden. Saturday morning, the neighbors remove one-third of the pink flamingos and paint them white and put them back in Sue's garden. Also Sunday morning, 18 plastic pink flamingos were added to the menu. At noon on Sunday, how much more plastic pink flamingos were there than white flamingos?	24	"Jambo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Friday: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday: 1/3 of 18 = 6 pink flamingos removed and painted white, leaving 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. 6 white flamingos added, so total = 12 pink + 6 white = 18
Sunday morning: 18 more pink flamingos added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos. Still 6 white flamingos.

At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. To find the difference, subtract: 30 - 6 = 24.

So, there are 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

195	One pencil costs One pencil and PE glue combined. if a pencil costs 1.20$ PE glue 0.30$ , what is the cost of 8 pencils?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One pencil costs the same as one pencil and PE glue combined. So, if a pencil costs $1.20 and PE glue costs $0.30, then one pencil and PE glue together cost $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Since one pencil costs the same as one pencil and PE glue combined, one pencil also costs $1.50.

Now, let's find the cost of 8 pencils:

8 pencils = 8 x $1.50 = $12.00

Kushusha! (That's it!)

The cost of 8 pencils is $12.00."
196	200 pounds of carrots should be distributed to 40 restaurants in Fulani Town. If each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?	120	"Sannu! (Hello!) In Fulani, we say ""Hewa!"" (Let's calculate!)

If each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots used will be:

2 pounds/restaurant × 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots initially, the amount not used will be:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used. Wa zai yi! (That's it!)"

198	In the beginning, Elain had 20 pokemon cards. He collected three times as many by the end of the month. In the middle of February, he collected 20 cards less than he collected in the first month. In the middle of March, he collected twice as many cards as he collected in the first two months. How many pokemon cards does he have now?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Elain had 20 cards initially.
He collected 3 times as many by the end of the month, so that's 20 x 3 = 60 cards.
Now he has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In February, he collected 20 cards less than the first month, so that's 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
Now he has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In March, he collected twice as many cards as the first two months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards.
Now he has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Elain has 320 pokemon cards now!

199	Marc is a proofreader. He proofreads the same number of sentences each week for different editors, paid at different rates. Editor B pays Marc twice as much as editor A. Marc proofreads a total of 1,000 sentences per week, but editor A gives him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Marc earn per week, in cents?	7500	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Marc proofreads 1,000 sentences per week.
Editor A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Marc earns 1,000 x 5 = 5,000 cents from Editor A.

Since Editor B pays twice as much as Editor A, Editor B pays 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents per sentence.
Let's say Marc proofreads x sentences for Editor B. Then, he earns 10x cents from Editor B.

We know Marc proofreads a total of 1,000 sentences per week, so the number of sentences for Editor A and Editor B must add up to 1,000:
x + (1,000 - x) = 1,000

The number of sentences for Editor A is 1,000 - x.

Marc earns 5,000 cents from Editor A and 10x cents from Editor B. His total weekly earnings are:
5,000 + 10x = Total earnings

Since Marc proofreads the same number of sentences for both editors, the number of sentences for Editor B (x) is half of the total:
x = 1,000 / 2 = 500

Now, let's calculate Marc's total weekly earnings:
5,000 + 10(500) = 5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000 cents

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!) Marc earns 10,000 cents per week."

201	Jean receives a job award. This award includes a bonus of $5,000 plus a 5% salary increase. If she earns $2,000 a week, every week of the year, and receives the award on the first day of the year, how much money did she earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean earns $2,000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so her annual salary is:
$2,000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The 5% salary increase means she'll get an additional:
$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200/year

Adding the bonus of $5,000, her total earnings for the year are:
$104,000/year + $5,200/year + $5,000 = $114,200/year

So, Jean earned $114,200 that year.

204	Janet has 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pencils and 2 bags of red pencils. There were 9 bags of blue pencils and 6 bags of red pencils. How many pencils does Janet have now?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pencils initially.

She bought 6 bags of blue pencils, but there were 9 bags of blue pencils, so she got 9 - 6 = 3 extra bags of blue pencils. Let's assume each bag has 10 pencils (we're not told, but it's a reasonable assumption). So, she got 3 x 10 = 30 blue pencils.

She bought 2 bags of red pencils, but there were 6 bags of red pencils, so she got 6 - 2 = 4 extra bags of red pencils. Again, let's assume each bag has 10 pencils. So, she got 4 x 10 = 40 red pencils.

Now, let's add up all the pencils: 32 (initial) + 30 (blue) + 40 (red) = 102 pencils.

Janet now has 102 pencils.

207	Joe's Halloween candy bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candy apples. Each bar weighs twice the weight of a candy apple. If a chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does a bag of joe weigh in grams?	2600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend.

A chocolate bar weighs 40g, and each bar weighs twice the weight of a candy apple. So, a candy apple weighs 40g ÷ 2 = 20g.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars: 25 bars × 40g = 1000g.

And the total weight of the candy apples: 80 apples × 20g = 1600g.

Adding them together, we get: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, a bag of Joe's Halloween candy weighs 2600g.

208	On the first day, Rose went to buy 4 cats in the store. On the second day, Elle bought three times as many cats in the other store. On the third day, she went to the other store and bought five times the amount of go-to's. On the second day, how many cats did she buy in all three days?	76	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: Rose bought 4 cats.
Day 2: Elle bought 3 times as many cats as Rose, so Elle bought 4 x 3 = 12 cats.
Day 3: Elle bought 5 times the amount of cats she bought on Day 2, so Elle bought 12 x 5 = 60 cats.

On the second day, Elle didn't know how many cats would be bought on the third day. So, on the second day, the total number of cats bought in all three days is 4 (Day 1) + 12 (Day 2) = 16 cats.

209	Twenty-two dozen cups are worth $1,200 minus the total value of half a dozen players sold at $600 each. Calculate the price of one cup.	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izicupu eziyishumi nesine (22 dozen cups) = 22 x 12 = 264 icupu

Icala lezi zicupu (total value of cups) = $1,200

Izilali eziyi-6 (half a dozen players) = 6

Icala lezi lilali (total value of players) = 6 x $600 = $3,600

Icala lezi lilali esiyisithupha (half of players' value) = $3,600 / 2 = $1,800

Icala lezi zicupu esishiyayo (remaining value of cups) = $1,200 - $1,800 = -$600 (but we can't have a negative value, so let's assume it's a mistake)

Let's recalculate:

Icala lezi zicupu (total value of cups) = $1,200 + $1,800 = $3,000

Icala leyi cupu (price of one cup) = $3,000 ÷ 264 = $11.36

210	Sara wants to buy a new pair of shoes. The shoes she chooses are priced at 30$. A pair of sandals is 20$. Sara takes care of the neighbor's children 4 times. She gets 5$ at a time. Her parents give her 4$ each time. Who cuts the lawn. If Sara has already saved 10$ before starting to work as a babysitter, how many times does she have to cut the lawn before she can buy sandals?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola into engizibuza! (I love getting into this problem!)

Let's break it down:

Sara wants to buy sandals for $20. She already has $10 saved up.

She earns $5 each time she takes care of the neighbor's children, and her parents give her $4 each time. So, she earns a total of $5 + $4 = $9 per job.

To find out how many times she needs to work to buy the sandals, let's subtract the amount she already has from the price of the sandals: $20 - $10 = $10.

Now, divide the remaining amount by how much she earns per job: $10 ÷ $9 = 1.11 (round up to 2, since you can't work a fraction of a job).

So, Sara needs to work 2 times to earn enough money to buy the sandals.

211	Jerry is a chicken farmer. A brown hen will lay 3 eggs a day, and a white hen will lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry will lay 42 eggs a day. If there are two more white chickens than red ones, how many brown chickens are there?	4	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem in isiZulu.

Let's say the number of brown hens is x. Since there are two more white hens than brown hens, the number of white hens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs laid per day is 42. The number of eggs laid by brown hens is 3x, and the number of eggs laid by white hens is 5(x + 2).

We can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8: x = 4

So, there are 4 brown hens. Ngiyabonga!"

213	At the Dollar Store, Sloane had 100 customers who visited the store. The next day, 50 more than the previous day. If on Wednesday, the total number of customers was 500, how many customers did he see that day?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. On Monday, Sloane had 100 customers. On Tuesday, he had 50 more than Monday, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. The total number of customers by Wednesday is 500. To find out how many customers he saw on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total customers from Monday and Tuesday from the total customers by Wednesday.

So, 500 (total customers by Wednesday) - 100 (Monday) - 150 (Tuesday) = 250 customers on Wednesday.

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, both of which have holes in them, where he reads the PE that discharges all the water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In the last 4 minutes, the main pool had twice as many swimmers as the smaller pool. Now, it has four times as many swimmers. How many Maui's have a smaller pool?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that question.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kwanele ukuthola inani lezinhlanhla zesifundazwe esincane?""

(How many swimmers are in the smaller pool?)

Let's break it down:

Initially, the main pool had twice as many swimmers as the smaller pool. This means the ratio of swimmers was 2:1.

Now, the main pool has four times as many swimmers, which means the ratio is 4:1.

Let's assume the smaller pool has x swimmers. Then, the main pool has 4x swimmers.

Since the ratio was initially 2:1, we can set up the equation: 2x = x (initially)

Now, the main pool has four times as many swimmers, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 2x (currently)

Solving for x, we get: x = 8

So, the smaller pool has 8 swimmers.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Isifundazwe esincane sinezinhlanhla eziyisithupha."" (The smaller pool has 8 swimmers.)"
215	Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320,000 and a belt for $32.00 if her part-time job earns her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can buy the one she wants?	44	"Odiro ni! (That's okay!)

Let's calculate the total amount Lori needs: $320,000 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $320,032.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we'll divide the total amount by her hourly wage: $320,032.00 ÷ $8.00 = 40,004 hours

So, Lori needs to work 40,004 hours to buy the shoes and belt she wants.

In Swahili, that's: Lori anahitaji kufanya kazi kwa saa 40,004 ili aweze kununua viatu na kamba anavyotaka."
216	Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back at a 10% interest rate. If she had to pay $165 a month, how much money would Janet have left?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Now, let's calculate:

Janet borrowed $2,000 at 10% interest rate. To find the total amount she needs to pay, we calculate the interest: $2,000 x 10% = $200. So, the total amount is $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

Since she pays $165 per month, we need to find out how many months it'll take her to pay off the debt: $2,200 ÷ $165 = 13.33 months.

Now, let's find out how much money Janet would have left after paying off the debt. Assuming she doesn't spend any money during this period, she would have paid a total of $2,200. If she had $2,200 initially, she would be left with $0.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""UJanet uyayena imali engu-$0 ngemuva kokuphotha isicelo sakhe."" (Janet would be left with $0 after paying off her debt.)"

218	Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so he is half as old as Zack. Calculate the average age of all three in three years' time, if Harriet is now 21 times older.	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Harriet is 21 years old now. Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 × 21 = 63 years old.

Adrian is half as old as Zack, so Zack's current age is 2 × 63 = 126 years old.

In three years' time, their ages will be:

Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years old
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old
Zack: 126 + 3 = 129 years old

Now, let's calculate the average age:

(24 + 66 + 129) / 3 = 219 / 3 = 73 years old

So, the average age of all three in three years' time is 73 years old.

Total points scored by the four students = 251 points.
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)

Let's calculate the time Carmen spent playing:

Time for 3 crossword puzzles = 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes
Time for 8 southwest grids = 8 x 5 minutes = 40 minutes
Total time = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes

To convert to hours, divide by 60: 70 ÷ 60 = 1.17 hours

So, Carmen spent approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes playing these games.

221	One water tank has 120 liters of water. Céline uses 90 liters to irrigate a small vegetable garden. Then she gets rainwater that is twice as good as the rest. How many liters of water is there now in the cistern?	90	"Nzuri! (Good!)

Let's break it down:

Céline uses 90 liters, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Then, she gets rainwater that is twice as good as the rest, meaning she gets 2 x 30 = 60 liters more.

Now, add the remaining 30 liters to the new 60 liters: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

So, there are 90 liters of water in the cistern now.

226	James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 human, 20 grass and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass, what is the percentage chance (matching the adjacent value) that the randomly selected card is water?	33	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has:
30 (human) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

He loses 8 water cards, so he has:
40 (water) - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 grass cards, so he now has:
20 (grass) + 14 = 34 grass cards

The new total number of cards is:
30 (human) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The percentage chance of selecting a water card is:
(32 water cards / 96 total cards) x 100% ≈ 33.33%

So, the answer is 33.33%!"
227	For his lunch, Chad orders a mixed burrito. The small burrito costs $6.50. He adds a supplement of $2 meat, $1.00 cheese, $1.00 avocado and 2 sauces at $0.25 per sauce. He opts for the premium option at $3.00 more, as he likes to add fries to one drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use at the checkout. How much is left for him to pay?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Small burrito: $6.50
Meat: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Sauce (2): $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Premium option: $3.00
Total: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

He has a $5.00 gift card, so he'll pay:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

228	Kalinda will try to make a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. She can add 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother will add twice the subtraction in a minute. How long will it take them to complete this puzzle?	1	"Mukwano! (My friend!)

Let's break this down:

Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute.
Her mother adds twice as many pieces as Kalinda subtracts in a minute. Since Kalinda adds 4 pieces, her mother adds 2 x 4 = 8 pieces per minute.

Together, they add 4 + 8 = 12 pieces per minute.

To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they add per minute:

360 pieces ÷ 12 pieces/minute = 30 minutes

So, it will take Kalinda and her mother 30 minutes to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Sawa sawa, mukwano! (That's all, my friend!)"
229	The watermelon garden has produced 120 watermelon chicks. Ashley goes to the garden after two months and finds that 30 percent of the watermelon is ripe for harvesting and chooses to bring it to her. On her return, after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelon is ripe for harvesting. How many watermelons are not ripe for harvesting after two weeks?	21	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there are 120 watermelon chicks.

After 2 months, 30% are ripe, which is 0.3 x 120 = 36 watermelons. Ashley takes them, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

After 2 weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ripe, which is 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons.

So, the number of watermelons not ripe for harvesting after 2 weeks is 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

231	Kylie and Robert like to go to the beach to eat shellfish. On Monday, Kylie ate 5 more shellfish than Robert ate for her, out of 20 shellfish. On Tuesday, Kylie ate 2 more shellfish than Robert ate for her. How many shellfish did Kylie eat on Tuesday?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Kylie ate 5 more shellfish than Robert. If they had 20 shellfish in total, Robert ate 20 - 5 = 15, and Kylie ate 15 + 5 = 20.

On Tuesday, Kylie ate 2 more shellfish than Robert. Since Kylie ate all 20 on Monday, Robert must have eaten 20 - 2 = 18 on Tuesday. Then Kylie ate 18 + 2 = 20 shellfish on Tuesday.

Kylie ate 20 shellfish on Tuesday.

Let's break it down. Dax removed twice the number of tiny tissues as there were ants. If there were 50 ants, that means he removed 2 x 50 = 100 tiny tissues.

So, the total number of tiny tissues in the garden is 100 + 50 = 150.

234	Steve now wants to eat more tomatoes and decides to grow his own tomatoes. He will eat twice as much as his friend for 6 a day. Knowing that the tree will produce 3 tomatoes a week, how many plants does he need?	21	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break this down:

Steve eats twice as much as his friend, and they eat 6 tomatoes a day. So, Steve eats 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes a day.

In a week, Steve eats 12 tomatoes/day x 7 days = 84 tomatoes.

The tree produces 3 tomatoes a week, so Steve needs 84 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/week = 28 plants.

239	A classroom has 1,000 students. A classroom with 3 entrances A, B and C will be equally useful for exit. If, after the meeting, 30% of the students left the classroom on exit A, 3/5 on exit B and the rest on exit C, calculate the number of students who used exit C.	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

30% of 1,000 students left through exit A, which is:
0.3 x 1,000 = 300 students

3/5 of 1,000 students left through exit B, which is:
(3/5) x 1,000 = 600 students

Now, let's find the number of students who used exit C:
1,000 - (300 + 600) = 1,000 - 900 = 100 students

So, 100 students used exit C.

242	Mike used to be a correspondent for 5 people and then moved on to be a correspondent for 2 people. Others will send 2 5-page letters to one person every week. He will reply to them in the same way. If he can write a speech in 6 minutes, how many hours will he spend writing in a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Mike writes to 2 people, and each letter is 5 pages. So, he writes 2 x 5 = 10 pages.

Others send 2 letters to 1 person every week, and Mike replies in the same way. So, he writes 2 x 10 = 20 pages in response.

In total, Mike writes 10 + 20 = 30 pages per week.

If Mike can write a speech in 6 minutes, that means he can write 1 page in 6 minutes.

To find out how many minutes it takes to write 30 pages, we multiply: 30 pages x 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide: 180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

So, Mike will spend 3 hours writing in a week.

Let's break it down:

Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, he talks to his boss for a total of:

15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes

He also made 300 minutes of additional calls. So, the total minutes used are:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Jason has a monthly phone bill of 1,000 minutes. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available:

1,000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left.

244	Griffin had 24 fries but Kyle has 5. Billy has twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries, then Colby gets from Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle got. If, in the end, Griffin has 27 fries, how many fries does Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Kyle has 5 fries.
2. Billy has twice as many as Kyle, so Billy has 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
3. Griffin had 24 fries initially.
4. Ginger gives Griffin half of her fries, so let's call the number of fries Ginger has ""x"". Then, Griffin gets x/2 fries from Ginger.
5. After getting fries from Ginger, Griffin has 24 + x/2 fries.
6. Colby gets 3 fewer fries than Kyle from Griffin, so Colby gets 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin.
7. Now, Griffin has 24 + x/2 - 2 fries left.
8. We know that, in the end, Griffin has 27 fries, so we set up the equation: 24 + x/2 - 2 = 27.
9. Solving for x, we get: x = 14.

So, Ginger has 14 fries and gives Griffin half of them, which is 14/2 = 7 fries.

245	There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inhloso. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Izicathamo ezinhlanu zikwi-aquarium yesi-1, izicathamo ezithathu zikwi-aquarium yesi-2. Ukudlula kwalezicathamo kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2 kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme amafishi amabili kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2.

(Let's break it down: There are 4 carcasses in aquarium 1 and 32 in aquarium 2. The difference between the carcasses in the two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in the two aquariums.)

Ukuthola ukuthi izicathamo ezinhlanu zikwi-aquarium yesi-1, izicathamo ezithathu zikwi-aquarium yesi-2, ukudlula kwalezicathamo kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme amafishi amabili kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2.

(To find the answer, let's use the fact that there are 4 carcasses in aquarium 1 and 32 in aquarium 2, and the difference between the carcasses is equal to twice the increase in fish in the two aquariums.)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi amafishi amabili kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2 kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme ngamafishi angu-28.

(I want to find the answer, which is that the increase in fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 is equal to 28 fish.)

Ngakho, amafishi kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2 kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme ngamafishi angu-28. Ukuthola ukuthi amafishi kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2 kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme ngamafishi angu-28, ngakho amafishi kwi-aquarium yesi-1 kuya kwi-aquarium yesi-2 kukhona ukuthi kukuphakeme ngamafishi angu-28.

(Therefore, the fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 are equal, and the increase in fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 is equal to 28 fish. Since the fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 are equal, and the increase in fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 is equal to 28 fish, then the fish in aquarium 1 and aquarium 2 are equal to 28 fish.)
