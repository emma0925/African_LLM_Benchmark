0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. Each morning she eats three for breakfast and then cooks muffins for her friends with four eggs. She then sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 a duck egg. How much money does she make a day at the farmers' market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day.
She eats 3 for breakfast, leaving 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
She uses 4 eggs to make muffins, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

Ngicela ukuthi uqonde! (I hope that makes sense!)

1	A cloth takes 2 bolts of blue fiber through the middle of the white fiber. How many bolts does this cloth take?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi uwuthole 2 bolts of blue fiber, futhi uwuthola white fiber emngeni. Kuthola 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

(Translation: I think you took 2 bolts of blue fiber, and you also took white fiber in the middle. You took 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.)

Answer: 3 bolts."
2	Josh decides to try buying and selling a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 to renovate it. This increases the price of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000, so his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The renovation increases the price by 150%, so the new price is $80,000 + (150% of $80,000) = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh sells the house for $200,000, so his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

In isiZulu, we say ""Wenza kakhulu!"" (You did very well!) Josh made a profit of $70,000!"

4	Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens three cups of a mixture of chicken food, consisting of seeds, coconut flour and vegetables for their health.She gives the chickens their food three times.In the morning she gives her chickens 15 cups of food.In the afternoon she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food.How many cups of food would she want to give her chickens in the last meal of the day if Wendi's chickens are 20?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food, 3 times a day. That's a total of 3 x 3 = 9 cups of food per chicken per day.

She has 20 chickens, so she needs 20 x 9 = 180 cups of food per day.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups she needs for the last meal, we subtract 40 from 180: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

So, Wendi would want to give her chickens 140 cups of food in the last meal of the day.

5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new home. A pair of glasses cost $5 but buying a second pair cost 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for these glasses?	64	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The first pair of glasses costs $5.
The second pair costs 60% of $5, which is $5 x 0.6 = $3.
Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, she'll buy 1 pair at $5 and 15 pairs at $3 each.
The total cost will be $5 + (15 x $3) = $5 + $45 = $50.

Kylar should pay $50 for the 16 glasses.

6	Toulouse has twice as many votes as Charleston. Charleston also has four more votes than Seattle. How many votes do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if Seattle has 20?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 votes.
Charleston has 4 more votes than Seattle, so Charleston has 20 + 4 = 24 votes.
Toulouse has twice as many votes as Charleston, so Toulouse has 24 x 2 = 48 votes.

So, Toulouse has 48 votes, Charleston has 24 votes, and Seattle has 20 votes.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Toulouse inemavoti angu-48, Charleston inemavoti angu-24, kanti Seattle inemavoti angu-20."""
7	Carla is downloading a 200GB file. She usually downloads 2GB/minute, but 40% of the time in between downloads, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla restarts the download from the beginning. How long will it take to download the file?	160	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxaki yakho! (I love tackling your problem!)

Let's break it down:

Carla downloads 2GB/minute, so to download 200GB, it would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the time is spent on Windows updates, which means 60% of the time is spent downloading. To find the actual download time, we'll divide the total time by 0.6:

100 minutes ÷ 0.6 = 166.67 minutes

But wait, there's more! Every time Windows updates, Carla loses 20 minutes. Since she restarts from the beginning, we need to add those lost minutes to the total time:

166.67 minutes + (166.67 minutes × 0.4) = 166.67 minutes + 66.67 minutes = 233.34 minutes

So, it will take Carla approximately 233.34 minutes to download the file.

8	John drives for 3 hours at 60mph and returns home after remembering that he forgot something at home. He tries to get home by 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop. He then spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, before he can drive the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. How far would he be from home by the end of 4 hours?	45	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Okay, let's calculate!)

John drives for 3 hours at 60mph, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60mph × 3h = 180 miles

He returns home and waits for 2 hours, so he doesn't move.

Then, he runs at 30mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30mph × 1h = 30 miles

Now, he drives the remaining 1 hour at 80mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80mph × 1h = 80 miles

Total distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered while returning
= 180 miles - (30 miles + 80 miles)
= 180 miles - 110 miles
= 70 miles

So, John would be 70 miles away from home by the end of 4 hours.

9	Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10/hour, so she earns:
40 hours x $10/hour = $400

For the additional 5 hours, she earns 1.2 times $10/hour, which is:
$10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour

So, for the additional 5 hours, she earns:
5 hours x $12/hour = $60

In total, Eliza earns:
$400 + $60 = $460

13	Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sells one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, another 2 to the red house, and the middle to the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many will she start selling?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Melanie sells 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners to the green house. This means she sells 1 part out of 3.
* She sells 2 to the red house.
* She sells the middle (which is 1 part out of 3) to the orange house.

So, in total, she sells 1 part (to green house) + 2 (to red house) + 1 part (to orange house) = 2 parts out of 3.

This means she has 1 part out of 3 left, which is 1/3 of her initial vacuum cleaners.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

1/3 × initial vacuum cleaners = 5

To solve for the initial number of vacuum cleaners, we can multiply both sides by 3:

initial vacuum cleaners = 5 × 3
initial vacuum cleaners = 15

So, Melanie started selling 15 vacuum cleaners.

14	In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 kids are learning modern dance, which is 20 x 0.2 = 4 kids.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 kids.

25% of the remaining 16 kids are learning jazz, which is 16 x 0.25 = 4 kids.

That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 kids learning hip-hop.

To find the percentage, divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of kids and multiply by 100:

(12 ÷ 20) x 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the kids are hip-hop dancers.

15	A salesman has to choose between two sales: Jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to rise 2.5% and the electronics market to rise 1.2% in the same month. If the salesman expects a high profit at the end of the month, what profit would he make?	125	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkohlakalo yakho!

(In Zulu, ""I'm happy to help you with your question!"")

Let's calculate the expected profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Expected profit = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Expected profit = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96

If the salesman expects a high profit at the end of the month, he would choose the jewelry option, which is expected to yield a profit of $125."
16	Two trains leave San Rafaek at the same time. They both travel 80 miles westward. The next day they travel 150 miles northward. After two days, how far have the trains traveled?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ukuthola ukuthi bemikhondo emibili abakhululekile ukuthi bafike emakhilomitheni angu-230.

(Translation: I'll help you with the problem of the two trains. 

First, the two trains traveled 80 miles westward. Then, they traveled 150 miles northward.

To find out how far they traveled, we add the two distances: 80 + 150 = 230.

So, the two trains have traveled a total distance of 230 miles.)"
17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?	57500	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Okay, let's see!)

As a teacher, she works 50 weeks/year × 35 hours/week = 1750 hours/year.

As a cheerleader, she works 50 weeks/year × 15 hours/week = 750 hours/year.

Total hours worked per year = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours.

Let's assume her hourly wage as a teacher is GHC 20 (Ghana Cedis) and as a cheerleader is GHC 15.

Total earnings per year = (1750 hours × GHC 20/hour) + (750 hours × GHC 15/hour)
= GHC 35,000 + GHC 11,250
= GHC 46,250 per year.

18	Claire cooks a 3 egg omelet in the morning at breakfast. How many dozen eggs does she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 1 week, she eats 3 eggs/day × 7 days = 21 eggs.

In 4 weeks, she eats 21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Now, let's convert 84 eggs to dozen eggs. 1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs, so:

84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

19	Marissa is walking a 12-mile hike that takes her one hour to walk the first four miles, then the next two miles in one hour. If she wants to go halfway to four miles per hour and stop, how far (in miles per hour) would she have to walk to complete the remaining distance?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Marissa walks 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is 4 miles/hour.
Then, she walks 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is 2 miles/hour.

She wants to go halfway, which is 6 miles (12 / 2 = 6).
She has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles, so she needs to walk 6 - 6 = 0 miles to reach halfway.

To complete the remaining distance, she needs to walk 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
She wants to walk at 4 miles/hour to complete the remaining distance.
Time = Distance / Speed, so Time = 6 miles / 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours.

To find her speed, we need to find the distance she needs to walk per hour to complete the remaining distance in 1.5 hours.
Speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles/hour.

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and I plan to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water. But when pouring, I drop one liter of orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Orange juice: 10 liters with 2/3 water = 10 x 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water
You drop 1 liter, so remaining orange juice = 10 - 1 = 9 liters
Remaining water in orange juice = 9 x 2/3 = 18/3 liters of water

Pineapple juice: 15 liters with 3/5 water = 15 x 3/5 = 9 liters of water

Total water = 18/3 + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 liters of water

21	Raynond and Samantha are grandchildren. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha was born. Raymond had a child at the age of 23 or Samantha was 31 when Raymond's child was born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that.

If Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, that means when Samantha was born, Raymond was already 6 years old.

Let's assume Samantha's current age is x. Then Raymond's current age would be x + 6.

When Raymond had a child at 23, Samantha's age would be 23 - 6 = 17.

Now, if Samantha was 31 when Raymond's child was born, then Raymond's age would be 31 - 6 = 25, which is not equal to 23.

So, the correct answer is that Raymond had a child when Samantha was 17.

22	Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday, his first 3 customers buy one DVD each. His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. His last 3 customers don't buy DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?	7	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (That's ""Let's calculate"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language!)

Billy sold 1 DVD to each of his first 3 customers, so that's 3 DVDs.
He sold 2 DVDs to each of his next 2 customers, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

24	Kyle bought the best-selling book of the year for $19.50. This includes a 25% commission on the sales price. What was the actual price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: if the selling price is $19.50 and the commission is 25%, that means the commission is 25% of the actual price. Let's call the actual price ""x"".

The selling price is the actual price plus the commission, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

1.25x = 19.50

Divide both sides by 1.25:

x = 15.60

So, the actual price of the book is $15.60.

25	Marie ordered a chicken dish for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid $50; how many boxes of pizza did Marie order if one box was $8.50?	2	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered:

* Chicken dish: $12
* 5 packs of milk: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total cost so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid $50, so the remaining amount is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Since one box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza

26	Mishka bought 3 shorts, 3 panties, and 3 boots, one short for $16.50, one pants for $22.50 and one shoe for $42. How much did Mishka spend on his clothes?	243	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking! Let me calculate the total amount Mishka spent.

Mishka bought 3 shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
He bought 3 panties at $22.50 each, so that's 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
He also bought 3 boots at $42 each, so that's 3 x $42 = $126.

Adding all together, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""UMishka wazisa izimali eziyi-$243.""

Henry stopped first after 20 miles. That means he has 60 - 20 = 40 miles left.

He stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip, so he traveled 40 - 15 = 25 miles between his first stop and his last stop.

29	Gloria is looking for shoes to buy when she comes across a pair that fits her shoe budget. But, she has to choose between buying a pair of shoes or a pair of shoes that cost $5 less than the cost of a pair of shoes. If a pair of shoes costs $33, the shoes cost twice as much, how much do the shoes cost to buy?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

A pair of shoes costs $33.
The shoes cost $5 less than the pair of shoes, so the shoes cost $33 - $5 = $28.
But the problem states that the shoes cost twice as much as the pair of shoes. So, the shoes cost 2 × $28 = $56.

So, the shoes cost $56 to buy.

30	Darrel and Allen have the same age divided by 7:11. If their combined age is 162 years, how old would Allen be today?	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu, my friend.

Darrel noAllen bafana bakhona iminyaka efana, ekugcineni kubalulekile ukuthi iminyaka yabo iyafana, ngokuthi ibhalwe ngoku-7:11.

(Translation: Darrel and Allen are the same age, divided by 7:11.)

Let's say Darrel's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. Their combined age is 162 years, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide by 18:

x = 9

Now, Allen's age is 11x, so:

Allen's age = 11(9) = 99 years

Ngithola ukuthi Allen uyindlela eminyaka engu-99! (I think Allen is 99 years old!)

Is that correct, my friend?"
31	Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in his can. He asks his friends how many they think there are. One says there are 80. Another says there are 20 more than the average of the first one. The third says 25% more than the first one. What is the average of their prediction?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than the average of the first one, which is 80. So, the second friend's prediction is 80 + 20 = 100.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first one, which is 80. To find 25% of 80, multiply 80 by 0.25, which gives 20. Add 20 to 80, and the third friend's prediction is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's find the average of their predictions:

(80 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 280 / 3 = 93.33

So, the average of their predictions is 93.33 jelly beans.

Kutheni, Gretchen una-mali angu-110. (So, Gretchen has 110 coins.)

Kune-gold coins engu-30 ezikhona kune-silver coins. (There are 30 gold coins less than silver coins.)

Siyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's find the number of gold coins.

Let the number of gold coins be x.

Then, the number of silver coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110.

So, x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide by 2: x = 40

Kutheni, Gretchen una-gold coins angu-40. (So, Gretchen has 40 gold coins.)

Ngiyabonga! (I'm grateful!)"
34	Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than Raymond's average. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?	23	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!)

Let's break it down:

Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than Raymond's average, which is 40. So, Aaron has 40 + 5 = 45 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, who has 45 jewels. So, Siobhan has 45 - 2 = 43 jewels.

Sawubona! (Hello!) Siobhan has 43 jewels."
35	Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes he scored 4 goals. In the next 20 minutes he scored 25% more goals. How many goals did Mike score in total?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Mike scored 4 goals in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more goals, which is 4 + (4 x 0.25) = 5 goals. In total, Mike scored 4 + 5 = 9 goals.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently he is making $5 for 4 yogurts. How much does he buy yogurts for 30 days?.	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so for 30 days, he'll need 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

He makes $5 for 4 yogurts, so for 1 yogurt, he makes $5 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

To find out how much he'll spend on 60 yogurts, multiply the cost of 1 yogurt by 60: $1.25 x 60 = $75.

So, Terry will spend $75 on yogurts for 30 days.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
37	John is considering selling his toys and using the money to buy video games. He makes 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and is left with $5. How many Lego sets does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

John kade akhetha ukuthenga izitoyi zakhe futhi asebenzise imali ukuthenga amagemu. Wayengena 13 izitoyi ze-Lego futhi aza ku-$15 ngelinye. Wabuye wathenga amagemu 8 ku-$20 ngelinye futhi wahleka ku-$5.

39	Dana can run twice as fast as she can walk but jumps the rope at a moderate speed. If she jumps 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she walk in six hours if she walks one third of the time she runs and two thirds of the time she walks?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

If Dana jumps 3 miles per hour, that's her moderate speed. Since she runs twice as fast as she walks, her running speed is 2x, where x is her walking speed. We know she jumps at a moderate speed, so her running speed is 6 miles per hour (2x3).

Now, let's look at the time she spends on each activity. She walks one-third of the time she runs, which means she runs 4 hours and walks 2 hours (2/3 of 6 hours).

Her walking speed is half her running speed, so x = 3 miles per hour. In 2 hours, she walks 2x3 = 6 miles.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"
40	Brandon's iPhone is twice the size of Ben's. Ben's iPhone is twice the size of Suzy's. If Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, how old is Brandon?	8	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""I understand"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, so if Brandon's iPhone is x years old, Suzy's is x + 1 years old.

Ben's iPhone is half the size of Brandon's, so if Brandon's is 2y, Ben's is y.

Suzy's iPhone is half the size of Ben's, so if Ben's is y, Suzy's is y/2.

Now, we know Suzy's iPhone is one year older than Brandon's, so we can set up the equation:

x + 1 = y/2

Since Ben's iPhone is half the size of Brandon's, we know y = 2y/2, which means y = 2x.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x + 1 = 2x/2
x + 1 = x
1 = 0 (which is not possible)

This means the problem has no solution! Brandon's age is unknown, my friend!

Ka chi fo! (That's ""good luck"" in Igbo!)"

42	Mrs. Jones cooked five slices of apple pie for the fireman's lunch. She sliced each pie into eight slices and set five slices on the dining table for the guests to help themselves to a meal. At the end of her slices in the evening, there were 14 slices left over. How many slices did the guests eat?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mrs. Jones kudla ukudla okuningi kwepai ye-5, waya ngokucopheleleyo ukudla ngamaphesenti angu-8. Waya ngokuthatha amaphesenti angu-5 emikhunjini yokudla ukuthi abantu bakhe bazokuthola ukudla. Ngesikhathi sokugcina kwesikhathi, kukhona amaphesenti angu-14 akapheli.

(Translation: Mrs. Jones cooked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 slices. She placed 5 slices on the dining table for the guests to help themselves. At the end of the evening, there were 14 slices left over.

To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of slices the guests ate. We know that 5 slices were placed on the dining table, which means there were 5 x 8 = 40 slices. We know that 40 slices were served, and 14 slices were left over. To find the answer, we subtract 14 from 40, which means the guests ate 26 slices.)"
43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300-g bag has 5 servings, how many grams would you consume if you expect to eat 2,000 calories a day but have already eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 serving = 250 calories
* 1 bag = 5 servings = 250 x 5 = 1250 calories
* 1 bag = 300g
* Calories left for the day = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories
* Servings left = 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings
* Grams left = 0.8 x (300 / 5) = 48g

44	Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. Each pound of beeswax can make 10 tall candles. Each pound of beeswax and candle wire costs $10.00 to get it. If he sells each candle for $2, how much profit does he make if he sells 20 candles?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, and Charlie sells 20 candles, so he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound).

2 pounds of beeswax and candle wire cost $10 each, so the total cost is 2 x $10 = $20.

He sells 20 candles at $2 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2 = $40.

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40 - $20 = $20.

Charlie makes a profit of $20.

45	Meredith is a freelance journalist who writes about the topic of public health issues and then presents to clients every day as her life's work. The article takes 4 hours to research and write. Last week she wrote 5 articles on Monday with 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Find out how many hours she spent writing articles over three days.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday: 5 articles, each taking 4 hours = 5 x 4 = 20 hours

Tuesday: 2/5 more than Monday, so 5 + (2/5) x 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Each taking 4 hours = 7 x 4 = 28 hours

Wednesday: Twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 x 7 = 14 articles. Each taking 4 hours = 14 x 4 = 56 hours

Total hours spent writing articles over three days = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours

46	Candice put 80 Post-its in her purse before going to her work at the coffee shop. On the way she stopped to buy a pack of Post-its. Back at work she pasted Post-its on 220 different coffee mugs. If she was left with 23 Post-its in all, how many Post-its did she buy in her pack?	163	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Candice had 80 Post-its initially.
She pasted 220 Post-its on coffee mugs, so she used 220 Post-its.
She was left with 23 Post-its.

To find out how many Post-its she bought, let's set up an equation:

Initial Post-its + Post-its bought = Total Post-its used + Post-its left
80 + x = 220 + 23

Simplifying the equation:
80 + x = 243

Subtracting 80 from both sides:
x = 163

So, Candice bought 163 Post-its in her pack!

47	John buys red tires that are twice the size of blue tires. Red tires cost 50% more than blue tires. He spent $200 on a single blue tire that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on tires?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John bought blue tires for $40 each and spent $200, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue tires.

Since red tires are twice the size of blue tires, he needs 5/2 = 2.5 red tires (let's assume he can buy half a tire).

Red tires cost 50% more than blue tires, so they cost $40 x 1.5 = $60 each.

He spent 2.5 x $60 = $150 on red tires.

In total, he spent $200 on blue tires and $150 on red tires, so he spent $350 on tires.

Now, to find the time taken to get back:

Ukudlula ukuthola = Ukuthola ukuthola kwesikhathi (Speed) x Isikhathi (Time)
30 miles = 6 mph x Isikhathi
Isikhathi = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

52	Uriah's book bag has become too heavy for him. He has to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh a quarter of a pound each and his toys weigh a half pound each. If he removes the comic books, how many toys must he remove?	15	"Nkọọ! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.

If he removes the comic books, which weigh a quarter of a pound each, that means he's removing a total weight of x × 0.25, where x is the number of comic books.

Since he's removing all the comic books, let's focus on the toys. Each toy weighs 0.5 pounds. To find the number of toys he needs to remove, we can set up the equation:

15 = 0.5y

where y is the number of toys.

To solve for y, divide both sides by 0.5:

y = 15 ÷ 0.5
y = 30

So, Uriah needs to remove 30 toys.

In Yoruba, we can say: ""Oriah gbọdọ yọ ọpọlọ mẹta ti oṣere naa!"" (Uriah needs to remove 30 toys!)"

54	The Doubtfire sisters were driving home with seven kittens from a local zoo when their mother called to let them know that two of their pet kittens had had kittens. She said that Patchy, their first kitten, had had three times as many kittens as the previous ones, and Trixie, a kitten, had had 12. How many kittens do the Doubtfires have now?	40	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola le ngxoxo! (I love solving this puzzle!)

Let's break it down:

* The Doubtfire sisters had 7 kittens from the local zoo.
* They already had 2 pet kittens, Patchy and Trixie, who had kittens.
* Patchy had 3 times as many kittens as the previous ones, but we don't know how many the previous ones had. Let's call it x. Then Patchy had 3x kittens.
* Trixie had 12 kittens.
* To find the total number of kittens, we need to add the kittens from the zoo, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens.

We know that the previous ones (not including Patchy) had x kittens, and Patchy had 3x kittens. Since there are only 2 pet kittens (Patchy and Trixie), the previous ones must be Trixie. So, Trixie had x kittens, and Patchy had 3x kittens.

We're told that Trixie had 12 kittens, so x = 12. Then Patchy had 3x = 3(12) = 36 kittens.

Now, let's add up all the kittens:

* 7 kittens from the zoo
* 36 kittens from Patchy
* 12 kittens from Trixie

That's a total of 7 + 36 + 12 = 55 kittens!

How many boxes does a truck carry in order to pass over the bridge without exceeding the required weight on it?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry:

5,000 pounds (bridge capacity) - 3,755 pounds (empty truck with driver) = 1,245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight by the box weight:

1,245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the truck can carry 83 boxes without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

x = $40 / 0.75 = $53.33 (grocery bill)

He got paid $3 to bring the goods home, so he has $40 - $3 = $37 left.
He gave $4 to the person who brought him the groceries, so he has $37 - $4 = $33 left.

62	If Mercy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year. At the end of the first 20 years she is expected to receive 5% of the annual pension. If she leaves after 30 years she will receive an annual pension of what?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

After 20 years, Mercy receives 5% of $50,000, which is:
$50,000 x 0.05 = $2,500 per year

Since she continues working for another 10 years, her pension will increase. Let's assume the increase is proportional to the number of years worked.

After 30 years, she will receive:
$2,500 x (30/20) = $3,750 per year

So, if Mercy leaves after 30 years, she will receive an annual pension of $3,750.

64	Sophia is considering taking a road trip, trying to figure out how to get around on a full tank of gas. After traveling 100 miles [100 km] without filling her tank, she needs to fill it with 4 gallons [4.5 L] of gas. Her driver's manual says that her tank is full of 12 gallons [12 L] of gas. How many miles can Sophia travel on a full tank?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sophia traveled 100 miles on 12 - 4 = 8 gallons of gas.

To find out how many miles she can travel on a full tank, we can set up a proportion:

100 miles / 8 gallons = x miles / 12 gallons

Cross-multiply:

100 × 12 = 8 × x

1200 = 8x

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 1200 ÷ 8
x = 150 miles

65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to take a nap and read somewhere between. He does this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and reading (we don't know exactly how much time for reading, but it's between the TV time and nap time, so let's assume it's also 2 hours) three times a week. That's a total of 2 + 2 = 4 hours × 3 = 12 hours per week.

In four weeks, Jim will spend 12 hours/week × 4 weeks = 48 hours watching TV and reading.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"

67	A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest full of gems. Inside were 175 diamonds, 35 rubles less than diamonds and emeralds twice as much as rubles.	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubles: 175 - 35 = 140
* Emeralds: 2 × 140 = 280

So, the treasure chest has 175 diamonds, 140 rubles, and 280 emeralds.

69	Bailey starts with the money he has. He earns $5 a week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks if he has $100 what did Bailey start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Bailey earns $5 a week for 8 weeks, so he earns a total of:

$5/week x 8 weeks = $40

At the end of 8 weeks, he has $100. To find out how much he started with, we subtract the amount he earned from the total amount he has:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes, daily, during the week, and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she needs $15 per student, how much does she make per week?	7425	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate Judy's weekly earnings:

Monday to Friday (5 days): 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes
Saturday: 8 classes
Total classes per week: 25 + 8 = 33 classes

Each class has 15 students, so total students per week: 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students

Judy earns $15 per student, so her weekly earnings: 495 students × $15/student = $7,425

In Zulu, ""Izindleko zakhe zingu-$7,425 ngeweke!"" (Her weekly earnings are $7,425!)"
71	Kelian has two recipes, one of the first recipes has 20 recipes, the second one has twice as many recipes as the first one. How many recipes should Kilien count while preparing two dishes?	60	"Sawa sawa! (Hello!)

For 43 brownies at $3 each, Tommy will make 43 x $3 = $129. For 23 cheesecakes at $4 each, Tommy will make 23 x $4 = $92. In total, Tommy will make $129 + $92 = $221. Akwaaba! (You're welcome!)"""
73	Shiela bought five mobile phones each for $150 with a monthly payment plan of 3. There was 2% interest on each mobile phone. How much does Shiela pay each month for the next 3 months?	255	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

5 mobile phones × $150 = $750

2% interest on $750 = $15
Total amount = $750 + $15 = $765

Monthly payment plan for 3 months = $765 ÷ 3 = $255

Kubonga! (You're welcome!) Shiela pays $255 each month for the next 3 months."
74	Artie owns a flower shop at a farmers' market. He has three types of flowers, marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 a jar, pertunians for $1.87 a jar and begonias for $2.12 a jar. Artie doesn't have a changeable income today so he has decided to set his entire price without a license and use only dollars. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much money does he make?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Artie's earnings:

Marigolds: 12 pots x $2.74 = $32.88
Petunias: 9 pots x $1.87 = $16.83
Begonias: 17 pots x $2.12 = $36.04

Total earnings: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $85.75

Artie makes $85.75.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
75	Luke is spending time on the beach building sand castles. He eventually realizes that each section of the sand castle is about half the square footage of the section below it. If he makes 4 sections of sand castles with a top that has a footprint of 16 squares, how many square footage of the sand castles are there?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Section 1 (top): 16 squares
Section 2: 2 × 16 = 32 squares (since each section is half the square footage of the one below)
Section 3: 2 × 32 = 64 squares
Section 4: 2 × 64 = 128 squares

Total square footage: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 squares

76	Cecilia recently bought a new puppy. In veterinary science it is advisable to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. She will then give him 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of his life. If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many dog food bags are needed to be used in a year?	5	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia gives the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. That's a total of 180 cups.

After that, she gives the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so for the remaining days, it's:

365 - 180 = 185 days

In those 185 days, the puppy eats 2 cups per day, so that's:

185 days × 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Adding the cups from the first 180 days, the total cups needed in a year is:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one dog food bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need:

550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

So, Cecilia needs 5 dog food bags in a year.

Sɛ wo yɛ (That's all!)"
77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, what's the difference between Raymond and David's laundry if Sarah does 400 pounds?	100	"Elo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
David does one-fourth of Sarah's laundry, so David does 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""O di odun kan ni wọn ń ṣe, Raymond ń ṣe ẹgbẹẹrún kan, David ń ṣe ẹgbẹẹrún kan, ọkan wọn ń ṣe ẹgbẹẹrún mẹ́rin. Ó di ẹgbẹẹrún kan lọ́wọ́ Raymond àti David.""

78	Vincent can afford to buy flowers in packs of $2.50 or in packs of 2 for $1. How much money does he save if he buys 18 flowers at a good price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at each price:

**Option 1: Packs of $2.50**
18 flowers ÷ 1 flower/pack = 18 packs
Cost = 18 packs × $2.50/pack = $45.00

**Option 2: Packs of 2 for $1**
18 flowers ÷ 2 flowers/pack = 9 packs
Cost = 9 packs × $1/pack = $9.00

Vincent saves: $45.00 - $9.00 = $36.00

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
79	John keeps a dog. He takes it to a dog groomer for $100. The dog groomer gives him a 30% commission for attracting his new customer. How much does it cost to groom a dog?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

82	Grace weighs a hundred and twenty-five pounds. Alex weighs two pounds less than four times Grace's weight. How much do they weigh together?	623	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight, so:
Alex's weight = 4 x 125 - 2 = 498 pounds

Together, they weigh:
125 + 498 = 623 pounds

(I love getting explanations!)

Let's break it down:

Gene goes on vacation 4 times a year.
He's been going on vacation since he was 23, and now he's 34, so that's 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).
In 11 years, he's gone on vacation 4 x 11 = 44 times.
Each vacation has its own bedspread, so he has 44 bedspreads.

86	Greg has an alarm set to go off three times a day as a reminder. If the alarm goes off, it will continue to go off until Greg turns it off. If it goes off the first time today, it will go off four times. If it goes off the second time, it will go off three times as fast as it went off the first time. The third time, it will go off half as fast as it did the second time.	22	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that. If the alarm goes off the first time, it will go off 4 times. The second time, it will go off 3 times as fast, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 times. The third time, it will go off half as fast as the second time, so that's 12 ÷ 2 = 6 times.

So, the answer is: 4, 12, and 6. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
87	The company pays each employee $600 per month. The company has a policy to increase the salaries of each employee by 10% of the starting salary for those employees who have been in the job for five years. If Sylivie has just completed 5 years at the company last December what will she earn annually after 3 years?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sylivie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the starting salary, which is:
$600 x 0.10 = $60

So, her new monthly salary is:
$600 + $60 = $660

After 3 years, her annual salary will be:
$660 x 12 = $7,920

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Izimali zakhe ziyaba ngu-$7,920 ngonyaka."" (Her annual salary will be $7,920.)"
88	Marilyn's first record sold ten times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies altogether, how many copies did Harold sell?	8000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, that means Harald's sales are x, and Marilyn's sales are 10x.

We know they sold 88,000 copies altogether, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies!

Let's break it down:

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per person, and she invited 16 friends. So, she needs:

0.75 x 16 = 12 gift bags

Since each gift bag costs $2, she'll spend:

12 x $2 = $24

90	Ted known as T-Rex is planning to bring a dinosaur potato salad to the picnic. He knows that adult dinosaurs eat 10lbs of potato salad and a baby eats about half of what an adult eats. If there are 20 adults and 5 children, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he expects to provide enough food for everyone?	225	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ted needs to bring enough potato salad for 20 adults and 5 children. Adults eat 10lbs each, so 20 adults will eat 20 x 10 = 200lbs. Children eat half of what adults eat, so 5 children will eat 5 x 5 = 25lbs. In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225lbs of potato salad.

93	Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles in two seconds when Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet and increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, say, how many seconds would Gerald run the 400-meter hurdles, as his diet was increased?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Lee wayenza ukuthi angakhokheli i-400 meter hurdles ngamazwi amabili uma Gerald wayenza ukuthi angakhokheli i-400 meter hurdles. Kodwa Gerald waphinda iminyango yakhe waphakamisa ukukhanya kwakhe ngokushesha kwezi-10%. Uma Lee wakhokhela i-400 meter hurdles ngamazwi angu-38, ngicela ukuthi Gerald uzokhokhela i-400 meter hurdles kangakanani, uma iminyango yakhe iphinde?

Now, let's calculate:

If Lee's time is 38 seconds, and Gerald's speed increased by 10%, then Gerald's new time would be:

38 seconds / 1.1 (10% increase) = 34.55 seconds

So, Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 34.55 seconds.

94	In the community, domestic rabbits are 12 less than dogs and cats combined. If there are two cats for every dog, there are 60 dogs. How many animals are kept for entertainment in the community?	348	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, then there are 2 x 60 = 120 cats.

Dogs and cats combined is 60 + 120 = 180.

Rabbits are 12 less than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

In total, there are 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits = 348 animals kept for entertainment in the community.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
95	Of the 200 fifth graders, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Let the number of boys be B and the number of girls be G. We know that B + G = 200.

Since 2/5 of the boys are Girl Scouts, 3/5 of the boys are not Girl Scouts. Similarly, since 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts, 1/3 of the girls are not Girl Scouts.

Let's assume the number of girls not in Girl Scouts is x. Then, x = G/3.

We know that the total number of Girl Scouts is 2/5 of the boys plus 2/3 of the girls. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/5)B + (2/3)G = (2/5)B + (2/3)(3x) (since G = 3x)

We know that the total number of Girl Scouts is equal to the total number of students minus the number of boys who are not Girl Scouts minus the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/5)B + (2/3)(3x) = 200 - (3/5)B - x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(2/5)B + 2x = 200 - (3/5)B - x

Combine like terms:

(7/5)B = 200 - 3x

Now, we need to find the value of x. Let's assume the number of boys is 100 (just to make the calculation easier). Then, B = 100.

Substituting B into the equation, we get:

(7/5)(100) = 200 - 3x
140 = 200 - 3x
3x = 60
x = 20

So, there are 20 girls who are not in Girl Scouts.

98	Some cars pass through the first 15 minutes of traffic on the narrow road, some 20 cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes. 5 cars from the road line passed without any other narrow vehicles. If there were 30 cars in the first line on the road, how many cars passed through the narrow road in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Izimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu nezinhlanu ziqhakaza emgwaqweni wesithathu (30 cars in the first line)

Ezimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu nezinhlanu ziqhakaza emgwaqweni wesithathu = Ezimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu (15 minutes) + Ezimoto ezitholakala ezimbi (20 cars in the remaining 15 minutes) + Ezimoto ezinhlanu (5 cars that passed without any other narrow vehicles)

Ezimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu = 30 - 20 - 5
Ezimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu = 5

Kutheni, izimoto ezitholakala ezinhlanu nezinhlanu ziqhakaza emgwaqweni wesithathu (5 cars passed through the narrow road in the first 15 minutes).

102	John likes to drink a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then a glass of water before going to bed. He does this every day of the week, but he prefers to drink soda on weekends for dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the number of glasses of water John drinks per week:

* Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 3 meals a day, 7 days a week = 3 x 7 = 21 glasses
* 1 glass before bed, 7 days a week = 7 glasses
* Total glasses of water per week = 21 + 7 = 28 glasses
* But he drinks soda on weekends for dinner, so subtract 2 glasses (Saturday and Sunday dinner) = 28 - 2 = 26 glasses

John drinks 26 glasses of water per week.

103	It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If a city extends 42 miles from sea to shore, how many minutes does it take for the fog to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthi kusasa ukudla kwemini ukuthola ukuthi kusasa ukudla kwemini.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

If it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, to find the time it takes to cover 1 mile, we divide 10 by 3, which gives us 10/3 = 3.33 minutes per mile.

Since the city extends 42 miles, we multiply 42 by 3.33, which gives us 42 × 3.33 = 140 minutes.

So, it would take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city.

104	Poppy is solving a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She puts one-fourth of the pieces on the board, and her mother puts one-third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy puts 1/4 of 1,000 pieces on the board, which is:
1,000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces

Remaining pieces: 1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Her mother puts 1/3 of the remaining 750 pieces, which is:
750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces

Pieces left: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Kubonga! (Well done!) There are 500 jigsaw pieces left.

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch wide. What is the internal volume of the 3 boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the internal volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The internal dimensions of one box are:
Length (L) = 5 inches - 2 inches (for the two 1-inch walls) = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 inches - 2 inches (for the two 1-inch walls) = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 inches - 2 inches (for the two 1-inch walls) = 2 inches

The internal volume of one box is:
V = L × W × H = 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal volume is:
V = 3 × 24 = 72 cubic inches

107	Frankie watches TV after homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday he watches his favorite one-hour program every night. On Wednesday he watches shorter 30-minute programs. On Thursday he finished his homework early and watched a one-hour program every 30 minutes. On Friday he stayed late because it was the weekend and watched two one-hour programs each. If he watched all 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute programs did he watch?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour programs, so that's 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched 30-minute programs. Since he watched 7 hours in total, and 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, that leaves 5 hours. On Thursday, he watched 2 one-hour programs, so that's another 2 hours. Now we have 3 hours left. On Friday, he watched 2 one-hour programs, so that's another 2 hours. Now we have 1 hour left.

Since Wednesday's programs were 30 minutes each, Frankie watched 2 x 30-minute programs to make up that 1 hour. So, he watched 2 thirty-minute programs on Wednesday.

108	Henry is making cookies for a local cooking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he made last year. When he finishes cooking, he finds that he has baked 15 more cookies than he thought he would. He drops 5 cookies when he takes them out to cool, so now he has 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's work backwards to find the answer.

Henry has 110 cookies now, but he dropped 5, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before that.

He baked 15 more cookies than he thought he would, so he thought he would bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

He wanted to make twice as many as he made last year, so if we call the number of cookies he made last year ""x"", we can set up the equation:

2x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 100 ÷ 2
x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Henry wayengaba ngamaphiko 50 emenywa ngonyaka odlule."" (Henry baked 50 cookies last year.)"
109	A local gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. There is a company that says that if you fill one gallon of gas at this site with gas, you will receive a bonus of $20. If a person buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will he pay after receiving a bonus from the company?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The person gets a bonus of $20, so we subtract that from the total cost:

$30.00 - $20.00 = $10.00

So, the person will pay $10.00 after receiving the bonus.

110	Marcell and Beatrice are competing to see who can feed the fruit roll-ups, so they each roll-up as many as they can from their pile of fruit roll-ups. On the other hand, if someone makes a mistake by giving Beatrice a width of 2 roll-ups and a length of 24 roll-ups and Marcell a width of 3 roll-ups and a length of 14 roll-ups, how many roll-ups did they eat in the middle?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Beatrice has a roll-up with a width of 2 and a length of 24, so she has 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Marcell has a roll-up with a width of 3 and a length of 14, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

To find out how many roll-ups they ate in the middle, we need to find the total number of roll-ups and then subtract the number of roll-ups they have left.

Total roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

Let's assume they ate an equal number of roll-ups in the middle. To find out how many, we'll divide the total by 2:

90 ÷ 2 = 45

So, they ate 45 roll-ups in the middle.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
111	Julia's boat sank at sea. The boat took two liters of water for every ten feet it sailed back to shore. It took her 16 seconds to sail twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds to reach. How much water did the boat take before Julia reached the shore?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia sailed to reach the shore. We know it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore, and it took her 16 seconds to sail 20 feet. So, we can set up a proportion to find the total distance:

16 seconds / 20 feet = 64 seconds / x feet

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 64 × 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 ÷ 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia sailed 80 feet, we can find out how much water the boat took. The boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it sails, so:

80 feet ÷ 10 feet/liter = 8 liters × 2 liters/10 feet
= 16 liters

So, the boat took 16 liters of water before Julia reached the shore.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking, my friend!"

114	Jamal's phone can store six times as many photos as Brittany's phone. Brittany's phone can store 50 times as many photos as the number of birds in Jamal's zoo photo. If Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's picture of ducks in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jamal's phone stores 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone, so Brittany's phone stores 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos.

Brittany's phone stores 50 times as many photos as the number of birds in Jamal's zoo photo, so there are 300 ÷ 50 = 6 birds in Jamal's zoo photo.

Since the question asks about ducks, I'll assume all the birds are ducks. So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's picture of ducks in the zoo.

Find out how many shipping containers were imported on the second day on the assumption that each container contained 5 vehicles.	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, subtract the initial number from the new total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, divide the number of added vehicles by 5: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

So, 4 shipping containers were imported on the second day.

If Adrien and Lylah's earnings increased at the same time, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, find the total earnings of the couple in the next four years?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago. Lylah's earnings are 30% lower than Adrien's, so:

Lylah's earnings four years ago = $40,000 - (30% of $40,000) = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000

In the next four years, Lylah's earnings increase by 40%, so:

Lylah's earnings in the next four years = $28,000 + (40% of $28,000) = $28,000 + $11,200 = $39,200

Adrien's earnings also increase by the same percentage, so:

Adrien's earnings in the next four years = $40,000 + (40% of $40,000) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

The total earnings of the couple in the next four years are:

$39,200 + $56,000 = $95,200

Later, when she went to set the table, she had 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Julia had some spoons initially, but we don't know how many. Let's call it x.

She bought a new pack, so she now has x + new pack spoons.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she has x + new pack + 5 spoons.

She used 3 spoons for vegetables, leaving her with x + new pack + 5 - 3 spoons.

Now, she has 12 spoons when setting the table, so we can set up the equation:

x + new pack + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + new pack + 2 = 12

We know Julia had some spoons initially, so x ≥ 0. Let's try x = 0:

0 + new pack + 2 = 12

new pack = 10

So, Julia bought a pack of 10 spoons.

(Translation: Okay, I understand that Tom washes the car four times a month. If he washes the car four times a month, he washes the car 48 times a year (4 x 12 = 48).)

Uma ikhodi yomoto ingaba ngu-$15, ungakwazi ukuthi uyaphi kangaka ngonyaka? Uyaphi ngama-randi angu-$720 ngonyaka (48 x $15 = $720).

(Translation: If a car wash costs $15, how much does he pay annually? He pays $720 annually (48 x $15 = $720).)"
135	Brian's friend Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian has three times as many. If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison, how many does Bobby have?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Brian had 20 video games initially, but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games now.

Brian has three times as many video games, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 video games.

Bobby has five times fewer video games, so that's 45 ÷ 5 = 9 video games.

So, Bobby has 9 video games.

137	Rory orders two soaps for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each to be delivered to her. There is a 29% surcharge on delivery and she wants an extra $5.00 handbag. How much does it cost to deliver the items she ordered?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

2 soaps = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Extra handbag = $5.00
Total cost before surcharge = $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00
Surcharge = 29% of $25.00 = $7.25
Total cost to deliver = $25.00 + $7.25 = $32.25

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) The total cost to deliver the items is $32.25."
138	Mark wrote an exam yesterday with 75 questions. He finished the exam with a time of 5 questions per hour. Today he wrote another exam with 100 questions at the same time. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first exam and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unanswered?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday's exam: 75 questions, 5 questions per hour, 8 hours to complete
Mark answered: 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions

140	Of the 20 existing rental cars, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and all others are in the process of being automatically and manually changed. What percent are in the process of being automatically and manually changed?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 12 are automatic
* 4 are manual
* Total cars = 20

To find the number of cars being changed, subtract the automatic and manual cars from the total:
20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars being changed

Now, to find the percentage:
(4 / 20) × 100% = 20%

So, 20% of the rental cars are in the process of being automatically and manually changed.

144	Kim has started her own home improvement business and is trying to figure out how much profit she can make from her employers. She already has 3 employers, but she is talking to 5 other potential employers and is confident enough to keep a close eye on her finances. Each household needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of wiping cloths. A bottle of bleach costs $2 and a pack of wiping cloths costs $5 each. This is all she needs to make a profit. She finds that her weekly income is about $92. Her profit is the difference between what she spends and what she earns, so how much is Lucas's $1 a week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Kim's expenses and income:

Expenses:
3 existing employers + 5 potential employers = 8 households
Each household needs 2 bottles of bleach = 8 x 2 = 16 bottles of bleach
Cost of bleach = 16 x $2 = $32
Each household needs 1 pack of wiping cloths = 8 x 1 = 8 packs of wiping cloths
Cost of wiping cloths = 8 x $5 = $40
Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72

Income:
Weekly income = $92

Profit = Income - Expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Now, let's find Lucas's $1 a week:
Lucas's $1 a week is not relevant to the problem, as Lucas is not mentioned in the context of Kim's business. It seems to be an unrelated question."

How many boxes does Jonny pick up if he collects all the Lego pieces?	2,125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the number of movable parts:

* One box has 500 movable parts.
* Another box has three times the number of movable parts, which is 3 x 500 = 1500.
* The last box has a quarter of the number of movable parts, which is 500 ÷ 4 = 125.

In total, Jonny picks up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 movable parts.

147	Debra is monitoring a hive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, then sees half of those bees return after the next 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as she first saw flying from the hive to the hive in the next 6 hours. And then all the bees that had left the hive before come back to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
* Half of those (30 ÷ 2 = 15) return after the next 6 hours.
* Twice as many bees as she first saw (30 × 2 = 60) fly from the hive to the hive in the next 6 hours.
* All the bees that had left the hive before (30) come back to the hive in the last 6 hours.

So, Debra saw 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Let's break it down:

Admission for 1 adult = $12
Admission for 1 child = $10
Total cost = $12 + $10 = $22

Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends.

James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 × 4 = 16 friends.

150	Steve and Tim decide to see who is the fastest to get home. Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to use his bike, Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can ride his bike 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the winner to finish the race from his home?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance = 3 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes each of them to cover their distance:

Steve's time = Distance ÷ Speed = 15,840 feet ÷ 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time = Distance ÷ Speed = 10,560 feet ÷ 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner! It will take the winner, Steve, 36 minutes to finish the race from his home.

151	Shawnda thinks that the children of her neighbors might need to have their bikes parked. She thinks that overcharging for a tire is the best way. One tire costs 25 cents to park. The first day 5 people came to park their two wheels. 3 people came to park their tricycle wheels. Finally one person comes to park his one-wheeled bike. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 people with 2 wheels each = 5 x 2 = 10 wheels
* 3 people with 3 wheels each = 3 x 3 = 9 wheels
* 1 person with 1 wheel = 1 wheel
* Total wheels = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 wheels
* Each wheel costs 25 cents to park, so total earnings = 20 x 0.25 = 5 dollars

153	Dave buys a large bag of French fries and eats fourteen before being snatched away by a hungry seagull. Upon landing, the seagull eats half as many as Dave has eaten. Three cockroaches also come and chase him from his diet, each cockroach eating three potatoes. Later, a raccoon steals one-third of the remaining potatoes. Ants carry one remaining potato, leaving five. How many French fries were in the bag that Dave bought?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Dave eats 14 French fries.

The seagull eats half as many as Dave, so it eats 14 / 2 = 7 French fries.

Three cockroaches eat 3 French fries each, so they eat 3 x 3 = 9 French fries.

Now, let's calculate the total number of French fries eaten so far: 14 + 7 + 9 = 30.

A raccoon steals one-third of the remaining French fries. Let's call the total number of French fries x. Then, the remaining French fries are x - 30.

The raccoon steals one-third of the remaining French fries, so it steals (x - 30) / 3.

We know that after the raccoon steals some French fries, ants carry one remaining potato, leaving 5. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 30 - (x - 30) / 3 = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x / 3 = 36

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

2x = 108

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 54

So, there were 54 French fries in the bag that Dave bought.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, a college student, Kimo has three one-hour classes a day. Tuesdays and Thursdays have two-hour classes a day. In one school, there are 16 weeks of school. In another school, how many hours does Kimo spend going to class?	272	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""I understand"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays have 3 one-hour classes, so that's 3 hours/day × 3 days = 9 hours/week.

Tuesdays and Thursdays have 2 two-hour classes, so that's 2 hours/day × 2 days = 4 hours/week.

Total hours per week = 9 hours/week + 4 hours/week = 13 hours/week.

Since there are 16 weeks of school, total hours spent in class = 13 hours/week × 16 weeks = 208 hours.

156	The zookeeper feeds all the apes. He buys all the bananas on the nearest field after every 2 months. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 and lizards need 100 every month, how many bananas does he need to buy to spend two months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monkeys need 200 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

Gorillas need 400 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

Lizards need 100 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

In total, the zookeeper needs to buy 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

157	Blake and Kelly are competing to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides not to run next to Blake and starts running back to the 40-yard line. He does this 34 times.	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the distance each of them ran:

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a total distance of:
2 x 100 yards x 15 = 3000 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 x 100 yards = 200 yards. Then, he runs back to the 40-yard line 34 times, which is:
2 x 60 yards x 34 = 4080 yards

Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is:
200 + 4080 = 4280 yards

So, Kelly ran a longer distance than Blake."

Let's calculate how much Raphael spent:

* 2 bills for $1.50 each = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
* 2 notebooks for $4 each = 2 x $4.00 = $8.00
* 1 pack of papers for $20 each = $20.00

Total amount spent = $3.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $31.00

Raphael spent thirty-one dollars on everything.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, the tank is 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it has an excess of 7 feet, so it's 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.
On Wednesday, the water is one-third of what it was on Tuesday, so it's 24 ÷ 3 = 8 feet deep.

So, on Wednesday, the tank is 8 feet deep.

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and its price increases by 20 percent every two months, how much will a bag of marble be worth after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial price = $20
Increase = 20% every 2 months

After 2 months, price = $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, price = $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months, price = $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months, price = $34.56 + (20% of $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months, price = $41.47 + (20% of $41.47) = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months, price = $49.76 + (20% of $49.76) = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months, price = $59.71 + (20% of $59.71) = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months, price = $71.65 + (20% of $71.65) = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months, price = $85.98 + (20% of $85.98) = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months, price = $103.18 + (20% of $103.18) = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months, price = $123.82 + (20% of $123.82) = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months, price = $148.58 + (20% of $148.58) = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months, price = $178.30 + (20% of $178.30) = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months, price = $213.96 + (20% of $213.96) = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months, price = $256.75 + (20% of $256.75) = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
After 32 months, price = $308.10 + (20% of $308.10) = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
After 34 months, price = $369.72 + (20% of $369.72) = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
After 36 months, price = $443.66 + (20% of $443.66) = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

So, after 36 months, a bag of marble will be worth approximately $532.39.

163	In the house, there are different kinds of toys: 5 red cars, 3 human toys and a doll. A doll has the same price as three people, and a red car costs $4. How much do all the toys cost if one person costs $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 doll = 3 human toys = 3 x $5 = $15
* 5 red cars = 5 x $4 = $20

Let's add up the costs: €1090 + €137 + €64 + €88 = €1379

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: €1500 - €1379 = €121

Elvira has €121 left to buy her dress.

To make 15 Spanish flan, she'll need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each day.
To find out how many days she'll need to take care of the child, we'll divide the total eggs needed by the eggs she gets each day:
45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs/day = 5 days

So, Sandra will need to take care of the child for 5 days to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flan.

In Twi, that's: ""Sandra bɛyɛ da biara a ɔbɛhwɛ ɔbabaa no mma 5."" (Sandra will take care of the child for 5 days.)"
167	Seth is twice Brooke's age. Within 2 years, their combined age will be 28. How old is Seth?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Let's solve this problem in isiZulu, my friend!

Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age. Let's call Brooke's age ""x"". Then Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. Their combined age will be:

x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide by 3:

x = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old now. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is:

2x = 2(8) = 16

Seth is 16 years old now!

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question, my friend!"

169	Pancho walks 20 miles a day except on weekends when he walks 10 miles. How many miles does he walk a week?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So, he walks:

20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles a day, that's 2 days. So, he walks:

10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

In total, Pancho walks:

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles a week

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
170	The marching band orders the new clothes: a uniform with a $25 hat, a jacket that costs three times as much as a hat, and a pair of trousers that cost between the cost of a hat and a jacket.	150	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Hat: $25
* Jacket: 3 x $25 = $75
* Trousers: between $25 and $75, let's say $50

So, the total cost is: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

172	There are four birds on Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8, how old are all four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.
Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

So, the ages of the four birds are:
Sally Two: 19
Granny Red: 16
Sally Four: 8
Sally Thirtytwo: 8

173	Jessica is trying to figure out how to pay off all her bills each month. Her student loans are at least $300 a month, her credit card is at least $200 a month, and her mortgage is at least $500 a month. If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the mortgage, how much does she pay per year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down for Jessica. Her mortgage is at least $500 a month, and she's willing to pay 50% more than that. To find 50% of $500, we multiply by 0.5: $500 x 0.5 = $250. Add that to her mortgage: $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's calculate her total monthly payment: $750 (mortgage) + $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) = $1,250 per month.

To find out how much she pays per year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1,250 x 12 = $15,000 per year.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking!"
174	Billy is beating and cutting potatoes to make a potato salad for dinner at the family barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to make. The potatoes are about the same age so it takes about the same time to beat and cut each one. It takes Billy a minute and a half to beat a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long does it take Billy to finish making a potato?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi Billy ithatha amasekondi angu-90 ukudla iphototho. (I think Billy takes 90 seconds to prepare a potato.)

Ukuthola ukuthi ukudla iphototho kuyindlela yokuthi: amasekondi angu-90 = (1.5 minutes x 60 seconds/minute) + 5 seconds = 90 seconds. (To calculate this, I did: 90 seconds = (1.5 minutes x 60 seconds/minute) + 5 seconds = 90 seconds.)

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each jar of lemonade they make, they spend $3 on lemonade and $2 on sugar. They sell a glass for $0.50 for 20 glasses per jar. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemonade?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izindleko zokuqala (Initial costs) = $3 (lemonade) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per jar

Izimpahla (Revenue) = 20 glasses/jar × $0.50/glass = $10 per jar

Izindleko zokuthengisa (Selling price) = Izimpahla - Izindleko zokuqala = $10 - $5 = $5 profit per jar

Izindleko zokuphakama (Total profit) = $25

Umngeni (Number of jars) = Izindleko zokuphakama ÷ Izindleko zokuthengisa = $25 ÷ $5 = 5 jars

Izindleko zokuqala zokulemoni (Total cost of lemonade) = Umngeni × Izindleko zokuqala zokulemoni per jar = 5 jars × $3 = $15

Ngithola ukuthi (I find that) they spent $15 on lemonade."
176	In the Asian race, with 240 competitors, 80 were Japanese and the rest Chinese. If there were 60 Chinese boys, how many girls were on the Chinese team?	100	"Ndi Igbo, ""O di kwa otu!"" (That's great!)

Let's break it down:

Total competitors = 240
Japanese competitors = 80
Chinese competitors = 240 - 80 = 160
Chinese boys = 60
Chinese girls = 160 - 60 = 100

Oge mma! (Well done!) There were 100 Chinese girls on the team."
177	Zaid spends a quarter of his salary on rent, a third on gasoline, and a third on charity. He gives his son $200 for his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much is left after these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

* Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
* Gasoline: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
* Charity: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
* Son's expenses: $200
* Wife's expenses: $700

Total expenses = $1,500 + $2,000 + $2,000 + $200 + $700 = $6,400

Now, let's calculate how much is left:

$6,000 (salary) - $6,400 (expenses) = -$400

Oops, it looks like Zaid has overspent! He's short $400.

In Zulu, we'd say: ""Akukho mali!"" (There's no money!)"
178	Rani has ten points more than Monic, which is less than Bo's. If Bo has 40, how many points do these three have combined?	122	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Bo has 40 points.
Monic has less than Bo, so let's call Monic's points ""x"". Since Rani has 10 points more than Monic, Rani has x + 10 points.
We know Monic has less than Bo, so x < 40.

Let's set up an equation: x + (x + 10) + 40 = total points

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = total points

Since Monic has less than Bo, x must be 30 (the closest number to 40). So, Rani has 30 + 10 = 40 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points: 30 + 40 + 40 = 110 points.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The three have 110 points combined."

180	Two candidates are competing to represent a class at a school in Sarai. If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes which the total number of schoolchildren who voted in the class was 80, find the number of votes the loser got.	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, that means the winner got 3 parts out of 4 parts.

To find the total number of parts, we multiply 80 (total votes) by 4/3, which gives us 106.67 (approximately 107).

Now, the winner got 3/4 of 107, which is 80.25 (approximately 80).

The loser got the remaining votes, which is 107 - 80 = 27.

So, the loser got 27 votes.

182	Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago Mark was half as old as Jan by five years. If Jean is 30, how old is Jan?	23	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jean is 30 years old.
2. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Mark's age is 30 - 2 = 28.
3. Two years ago, Mark's age was 28 - 2 = 26.
4. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan minus five years, so we can set up the equation: 26 = (Jan - 2) / 2 - 5.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 26 = Jan / 2 - 7.
6. Adding 7 to both sides, we get: 33 = Jan / 2.
7. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: Jan = 66.

So, Jan is 66 years old.

In English, the answer is: The probability of rolling a six-sided die is 1 (or 100%) since it's a certainty. The probability of rolling more than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling the same number twice in a row is 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36."

186	Russel works at a pet store and gives grass to the mice. The mice are kept in 3 enclosures with matching numbers and each rat is given 6 pieces of grass. There are 10 enclosures for isolated hamsters and one hamster is given 5 pieces of grass. There is also a rabbit enclosure in the river where 20 pieces of grass are distributed to the rabbit. No grass is used outside the store. If 160 pieces of rabbit are distributed to the mice, how many rats are in each enclosure?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* 3 enclosures for mice, each with 6 pieces of grass, so 3 x 6 = 18 pieces of grass for mice.
* 10 enclosures for hamsters, each with 5 pieces of grass, so 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of grass for hamsters.
* 1 rabbit enclosure with 20 pieces of grass.
* Total grass distributed is 160 pieces.

Let's subtract the grass for hamsters and rabbit from the total: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of grass for mice.

Since each enclosure has 6 pieces of grass, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the number of enclosures: 90 ÷ 6 = 15 enclosures.

But we know there are 3 enclosures, so we can divide 15 by 3 to get the number of mice per enclosure: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 mice per enclosure.

Let's calculate:

Selling price = $30
Cost price = $20 + $2 = $22
Profit = $30 - $22 = $8
Total profit = $400
Number of sacks = Total profit / Profit per sack = $400 / $8 = 50 sacks

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Each year he also cuts down two trees a year. He starts with 50 trees, after 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, so the net increase is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

After 10 years, he would have planted 10 x 8 = 80 trees.

Total trees after 10 years = 50 (initial) + 80 (newly planted) = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.

So, the number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

199	Mark is a copy editor. He edits the same number of lines a week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different amount per line. Publisher A pays Mark twice as much as Publisher B. Mark edits 1000 lines a week and is paid 5 cents per line by publisher A. How much does Mark earn per week per cent?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mark ukhokha amalayini angama-1000 emviki, futhi uyalwa ngama-5 cents kuya ngalayini ku-Publisher A. Publisher A uyahlula amadola amabili ku-Publisher B. Kuthola ukuthi Mark uyaphuma imali engakanani emviki?

(Translation: Mark edits 1000 lines a week and is paid 5 cents per line by Publisher A. Publisher A pays double what Publisher B pays. How much does Mark earn per week?)

Let's calculate:

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per line, so for 1000 lines, he earns:
1000 lines x 5 cents/line = $50

Publisher B pays half of what Publisher A pays, so Mark earns:
$50 / 2 = $25

Mark earns a total of:
$50 + $25 = $75 per week

201	John won a prize at work. The prize consists of a one-time payment of $5000 and a 5% increase in his salary. If he earns 2000 a week, a week off a year and he earned a salary on the first day of the year, how much does he make in a year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John's weekly salary is $2000. He gets a 5% increase, so his new weekly salary is:
$2000 x 0.05 = $100
$2000 + $100 = $2100 per week

He works 51 weeks a year (since he gets 1 week off). His total annual salary is:
$2100 x 51 = $107,100 per year

Plus, he gets a one-time payment of $5000, so his total earnings for the year are:
$107,100 + $5000 = $112,100

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six exams in each quarter. They allow children to subtract the lowest-lowest-average scores in each quarter. If Brinley has scores of 89,71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five exams, what scores does he need to make on the sixth exam to get an average score of 93?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuba Brinley ufuna ukuthola ingaphansi kwe-93, kufanele athole ingoma ephakeme ngokuqhubeka.

(If Brinley wants to get an average of 93, he must get a high score to continue.)

Ukuba sebenza umehluko, kufanele siqhubeke ngokuqala ukuthola ingoma ephakeme.

(Let's first calculate the total score.)

Ingoma ephakeme = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

(Total score = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438)

Ukuba Brinley ufuna ukuthola ingaphansi kwe-93, kufanele athole ingoma ephakeme ngokuqhubeka.

(If Brinley wants to get an average of 93, he must get a high score to continue.)

Ingoma ephakeme = (93 x 6) - 438

(High score = (93 x 6) - 438)

Ingoma ephakeme = 558 - 438

(High score = 558 - 438)

Ingoma ephakeme = 120

(High score = 120)

Kusho ukuthi Brinley kufanele athole ingoma ephakeme kwe-120 ukuthola ingaphansi kwe-93.

(Therefore, Brinley must get a score of 120 to get an average of 93.)"

Let's break it down:

* 1 chocolate stick weighs 40 grams.
* Each stick weighs twice as much as a candy apple, so 1 candy apple weighs 40 / 2 = 20 grams.
* There are 25 chocolate sticks, so their total weight is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams.
* There are 80 candy apples, so their total weight is 80 x 20 = 1600 grams.

Sara takes care of her neighbor's children four times for $5 each time she takes care of them. Her parents give her $4 each for mowing the lawn. If Sara has $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to buy a jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the total amount Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes: $30 + $20 = $50.

She already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she takes care of the children, and she does it 4 times, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20. Now she has $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $50 - $30 = $20. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $20 / $4 = 5 times.

211	Jerry has his chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Each day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu (Let's have some equations)

Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.

We know W = R + 2 (because Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42.

The number of eggs laid by red chickens per day is 3R, and the number of eggs laid by white chickens per day is 5W.

So, we can set up the equation: 3R + 5W = 42

Substitute W = R + 2 into the equation: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Simplify the equation: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8: R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

213	At the dollar store, Sloane counts the customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than on the first day. if the total on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem in isiZulu.

Let's say the number of customers on the first day is x.

On the second day, there were 50 more customers, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the third day is 500. Since we don't know the number of customers on the third day, let's call it y.

We can set up an equation: x + (x + 50) + y = 500

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 + y = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x + y = 450

Since we want to find y, let's subtract 2x from both sides: y = 450 - 2x

But we don't know x. Let's try to find x. Since there are 50 more customers on the second day, we can set up another equation: x + 50 = 2x

Subtract x from both sides: 50 = x

Now we can find y: y = 450 - 2(50) = 450 - 100 = 350

So, Sloane counted 350 customers on the third day. Ngiyabonga!"
214	Jerry has two pools of water, each with holes that discharge water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, now the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be x gallons. Then, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since each pool discharges water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water discharged from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 × 4 = 16 gallons. Similarly, the amount of water discharged from the big pool in 4 minutes is also 16 gallons.

Now, let's find the current amount of water in each pool:

Small pool: x - 16 gallons
Big pool: 2x - 16 gallons

We know that the big pool currently has twice as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 2(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 2x - 32
16 = 32
x = 32

So, the small pool had 32 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since 16 gallons were discharged, the small pool currently has:

32 - 16 = 16 gallons

Therefore, the small pool has 16 gallons of water.

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 goals.
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's goals, so Yuri scored (68/2) + 10 = 44 goals.
Brinna scored 17 more than Naomi's goals, so Brinna scored 68 + 17 = 85 goals.

The total goals scored by the four children are 251. We know the goals scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brinna, so let's add them up: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

To find Jojo's goals, we subtract the total goals scored by the other three from the total goals: 251 - 197 = 54.

So, Jojo scored 54 goals.

40 (water) - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 hammer cards, so he now has:
20 (hammer) + 14 = 34 hammer cards

The total number of cards James has now is:
30 (fire) + 34 (hammer) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The number of water cards is 32. To find the percentage, divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:
(32 ÷ 96) × 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage is:
33%

So, the percent chance that any card James picks up is water is 33%."
227	Chad bought a burrito for lunch. The bottom portion of the burrito is $6.50. He adds a steak for $2.00, a cheese for $1.00, a quarter for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each. He plans to add $3.00 to his meal by adding chips and drinks. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses when he leaves. How much money does he still have to pay?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

Bottom portion: $6.50
Steak: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Quarter: $1.00
Two sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total so far: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Adding chips and drinks: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad uses a $5.00 gift card, so he still needs to pay:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"
228	The calendar is making a 360-piece puzzle. The calendar can put together 4 pieces per minute. His mother can usually put together as many as half of the Calendar's pieces per minute. How many hours does it take to complete the puzzle?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi uma uCalendar uyenza amaphezulu 4 ngaminithi, umama uyenza amaphezulu 2 ngaminithi. Uma bebengena amaphezulu 6 ngaminithi, bazokwenza iziphezulu 360 ngaleso sikhathi esithunyi? 

(Translation: I want to know, if the Calendar puts together 4 pieces per minute, the mother puts together 2 pieces per minute. If they put together 6 pieces per minute, how long will it take to complete 360 pieces?)

Ukuthola ukuthi uma bebengena amaphezulu 6 ngaminithi, bazokwenza iziphezulu 360 ngaleso sikhathi esingama-60 amaminithi. Uma singama-60 amaminithi, singama-1 isikhathi esihlezi.

229	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30% of the milk was ripe, so she took it home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe, so she harvested it. After two weeks, how many milks were not ready to be harvested?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Initially, Ashlyn had 100% of the milk. After two months, 30% was ripe, so she took that home. That means 70% of the milk was left.

When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining milk was ripe. To find 3/4 of 70%, we can convert the fraction to a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75. Then, multiply 0.75 by 70%: 0.75 × 70% = 52.5%. So, 52.5% of the remaining milk was ripe, and she harvested it.

Now, let's find the percentage of milk that was not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We'll subtract the percentages that were ripe from 100%:

100% - 30% (first harvest) = 70%
70% - 52.5% (second harvest) = 17.5%

So, 17.5% of the milk was not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kwakutholakala ukuthi amasi angu-17.5% ayikho ukuthenga."" (It was found that 17.5% of the milk was not ready to be harvested.)"
230	Mark buys 12 of his company's cars. Each car costs $20,000. He pays 10% of the car's tax and another $1000 for the registration of each of them. What does he pay in total?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

12 cars x $20,000 = $240,000 (total cost of cars)

10% of $20,000 = $2,000 (tax per car)
12 cars x $2,000 = $24,000 (total tax)

$1,000 (registration per car)
12 cars x $1,000 = $12,000 (total registration)

Total amount Mark pays = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

231	On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20. On Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday.	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20. So Kyle collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday. So Kylie collects 25 x 2 = 50 shells.

232	Dax went to the field to gather apples and found as many insects as half the ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, find the number of ants in the garden altogether.	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Una mazwi amaningi emthini njengemali yabantu abahlanu emgandeni. (You found as many insects in the field as half the ants in the garden.)

Emgandeni kunezintu ezingama-50. (In the garden, there are 50 ants.)

Ukuthola ukuthi uma una mazwi amaningi emthini njengemali yabantu abahlanu emgandeni, uma uma mazwi amaningi emthini ngumali wesithupha sesi-50. (To find out how many insects you found in the field, if you found as many insects in the field as half the ants in the garden, then you found half of 50 insects in the field.)

Umali wesithupha sesi-50 ngu-25. (Half of 50 is 25.)

233	Thirty-six of the penguins are basking in the cold sun. A third jump into the sea to swim. Another third go into a cave to eat their evening meal. How many days do the remaining penguins stay in the sun?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

36 penguins initially
A third jump into the sea = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins
Another third go into a cave = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

Remaining penguins in the sun = 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins

Since the question asks about days, the answer is ""none"" because the remaining penguins don't stay in the sun for any days. They're already there!

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Akukho imini."" (There are no days.)"
234	Steve decides to start eating tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats six a day. If he eats three tomatoes a week, how many tomatoes does he need?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So, his girlfriend eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes a day.

In a week, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes/day × 7 days = 42 cherry tomatoes.

But the question asks how many tomatoes he needs. Since he eats 3 times a week, he needs 42 cherry tomatoes ÷ 3 = 14 cherry tomatoes per time he eats.

So, Steve needs 14 cherry tomatoes. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ibhinca elinganiselwe. (Let me help you with that calculation.)

Ram uses more than one pen, and he refills them with ink from used pens. If he buys 25 pencils and uses them to make a new pen when the ink runs out, it means he's reusing the ink from the used pens to fill new pens.

Since he's not using the pencils themselves to make new pens, the number of pencils remains the same - 25.

238	Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Jessa is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20, how old are all three girls?	68	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! Let me help you with that.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Jessica unezinhlanhla ezinhlanu eziyisikhombisa kubantu basethu.""

Okay, back to the math problem! Since Jessa is 20, and she's 5 years older than Joan, that means Joan is 20 - 5 = 15 years old.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 15 - 2 = 13 years old.

So, to summarize: Jessa is 20, Joan is 15, and Mary is 13."
239	If, at the end of the meeting, 30% of the children left on day A, 3/5 of the remaining children left on day B, and all the remaining children left on day C, find the number of children who left on day C.	280	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Let the initial number of children be x.

On day A, 30% of the children left, which means 0.3x children left. The remaining children are x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

On day B, 3/5 of the remaining children left, which means (3/5) × 0.7x = 0.42x children left. The remaining children are 0.7x - 0.42x = 0.28x.

On day C, all the remaining children left, which means 0.28x children left.

To find the number of children who left on day C, we need to know the initial number of children (x). Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide that information. However, we can express the answer in terms of x: 0.28x.

240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many candies does John have than James?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 54 candies and has twice as many as Robert, so Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""John unecandi engama-21 kunalokho uJames."" (John has 21 more candies than James.)"

242	Mike used to correspond with 5 people. He stopped associating with 2 of them. Each of them wrote 2 letters a week of 5 pages. He responds freely. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mike used to correspond with 5 people, but stopped associating with 2, so he's now corresponding with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of them writes 2 letters a week, and each letter has 5 pages, so Mike receives 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike responds freely, he writes 30 pages per week.

He can write a page in 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, it takes him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing per week.

243	Jason has a 1,000-minute monthly phone schedule. He has 15 minutes a day to talk to his boss and another 300 minutes this month to talk to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jason has 1,000 minutes in total.
He talks to his boss for 15 minutes a day, so for 30 days, that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.
He also talks to other people for 300 minutes.

Total minutes used = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Minutes left = 1,000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

244	Griffin had 24 shots, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin some of his shots, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 shots less than Kyle's total. If Griffin ended up with 27 shots, how many shots did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Griffin had 24 shots initially.
Kyle took 5 shots, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 shots.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 shots.
Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 shots left.
Colby gave Griffin 3 shots less than Kyle's total, which means Colby gave Griffin 5 - 3 = 2 shots.
So, Griffin now has 9 + 2 = 11 shots.
Since Griffin ended up with 27 shots, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 11 = 16 shots.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
245	There are 4 reefs in the aquarium and 32 in the aquarium, The difference in the number of reefs in the two areas is twice the number of fish in the two areas. If the aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each area?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Let the number of fish in each area be x.

The difference in the number of reefs is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference is twice the number of fish, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each area.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
246	A person who makes jeans for his face charges $250 an hour. He needs expensive make-up for a movie that he's taking six hours to make four times a week. The movie takes five weeks to complete. After the movie the person who makes jeans takes 10% off depending on the work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

* The person charges $250 an hour.
* They work 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks.
* Total hours worked = 6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours
* Total cost = 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000
* After 10% discount, the cost = $30,000 × 0.9 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000.

Let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since she divided the money equally between herself and her parents, we'll divide the total by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So each of them paid $32.

249	On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her brother; on Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies; her brother ate five cookies on Monday and 13 the next day; if one cookie contained 200 calories, how much more did Sue eat?	5,600	"""Sankofa yi ye nu! (Let's go back and fetch it!) 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her brother, who ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her brother ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. 

If one cookie has 200 calories, then Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. Her brother ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories. 

So Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her brother.
