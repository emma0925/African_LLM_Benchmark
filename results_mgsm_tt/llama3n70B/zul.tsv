0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three a day every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day for four. She sells leftovers at the farmers' market every day for $2 for a good duck egg. How many dollars does she make a day at the farmers' market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the eggs: 16 eggs - 3 eggs (eaten) - 4 eggs (baked) = 9 eggs left
She sells 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes: 9 x $2 = $18 per day

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"

2	John chose to try to change the house. He bought the house for $80,000 and put $50,000 into the renovation. The value of the house increased by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundisa ukuthi (Let me calculate)...

UJohn ubuthole ibhali eli-$80,000, futhi wathenga amakhono a-$50,000. Ukukhula kwemali yale bhali kwaba ngu-150%. Ngicabanga ukuthi (I think)...

Ukubonga kwemali yale bhali kwaba ngu-$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Ukukhula kwemali yale bhali kwaba ngu-150% yale $130,000, okuyinto (which is) $195,000. Ukuphumelela kwakhe kwaba ngu-$195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000.

UJohn uthole iphumelela eli-$65,000! (John made a profit of $65,000!)

3	James chooses to run at top speed three times a week.He runs 60 meters at top speed each time.How many meters does he run in a week?	540	"""Sawubona! James uyaphenduka ngamaphetheni athathu ngewe. Uyaphenduka izimitha ezingama-60 ngaphetheni ngalinye. Izimitha ezitholakala ngawe ngisuka ku-3 * 60 = 180."" (Hello! James runs at top speed three times a week. He runs 60 meters at top speed each time. The total meters he runs is 3 * 60 = 180.)"
4	Every day Wendy feeds her chickens three cups of chicken mixed food, including seeds, palms, and plants to help keep them nourished. She feeds the chickens three separate meals. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food should she feed her chickens at the last feeding if her flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxube! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

Wendy feeds her chickens 3 cups of food per meal, and she has 3 meals a day. So, the total amount of food she needs per day is:
3 cups/meal × 3 meals = 9 cups

She already fed 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so she's used:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since she needs 9 cups per day for her 20 chickens, and she's already used 40 cups, she needs:
9 cups × 20 chickens = 180 cups per day

To find out how many cups she needs for the last feeding, subtract the amount she's already used from the total amount needed:
180 cups - 40 cups = 140 cups

Since she feeds 3 cups per meal, divide the remaining amount by 3:
140 cups ÷ 3 cups/meal = 46.67 cups (round up to 47 cups, as you can't feed a fraction of a cup)

So, Wendy should feed her chickens 47 cups of food at the last feeding.

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"
5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for her new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of its value. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does she need to pay for them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

1st glass: $5
2nd glass: $5 x 0.6 = $3
3rd glass: $5
4th glass: $5 x 0.6 = $3
...
16th glass: $5 x 0.6 = $3

There are 8 full-price glasses and 8 discounted glasses.

Total cost = (8 x $5) + (8 x $3) = $40 + $24 = $64

Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep.

Adding them up, we get: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB per minute, but once she's at 40% download, Windows restarts to install the updated operating system, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start downloading from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Carla downloads 40% of 200 GB, which is 80 GB. At 2 GB per minute, that takes 80/2 = 40 minutes.

Then Windows restarts and takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla starts from scratch.

To download the entire 200 GB file, it will take 200/2 = 100 minutes.

So, in total, it takes 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

8	He tries to get home in four hours but spends the first two hours in traffic jams. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 mph, and then he can drive the remaining four hours at 80 mph. How far is it from home at the end of those four hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

He spends 2 hours in traffic, so no distance covered.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = speed × time = 30 × 0.5 = 15 miles.

Then, he drives for 4 hours at 80 mph. Distance = speed × time = 80 × 4 = 320 miles.

Total distance covered = 15 + 320 = 335 miles.

So, he is 335 miles away from home at the end of those four hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first forty hours of work in a week is $10. She also receives an overtime payment of 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. If Eliza has worked 45 hours this week, what is her weekly wage?	460	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10/hour, so her total earnings for those hours are:
40 hours x $10/hour = $400

For the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza earns 1.2 times her normal hourly rate, which is:
$10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour

So, her total earnings for the 5 hours of overtime are:
5 hours x $12/hour = $60

Now, let's add her earnings for the regular hours and overtime:
$400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's weekly wage is $460.

10	The new edition has 60 downloads in the first month.The number of downloads in the second month tripled the number of downloads in the first month, but fell by 30% in the third month.How many downloads in this edition, say a total of three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Total downloads in three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought different kinds of pastries. She bought 3 dozen doughnuts for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen cupcakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen small cakes for $55 a dozen.	694	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought:

* 3 dozen doughnuts = 3 x $68 = $204
* 2 dozen cupcakes = 2 x $80 = $160
* 6 dozen small cakes = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos has planted a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 a plant. Each year it will produce 7 oranges that can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial cost: $90
Yearly profit: 7 oranges × $1.5 = $10.50
Yearly cost: $3
Net profit per year: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

To find out how many years it'll take to break even:
$90 (initial cost) ÷ $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

So, it'll take Carlos 12 years to start making money from the lemon tree.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
13	Melanie is a door-to-door salesperson. She sold half and a quarter of the vacuum cleaners to the green house, two more to the red house, and the remaining half to the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many to start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold half and a quarter to the green house. That's 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

She sold 2 more to the red house, so that's an additional 2.

The remaining half went to the orange house, which is 1/2.

In total, she sold 3/4 + 2 + 1/2 = 9/4.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - 9/4 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

4x - 9 = 20

Add 9 to both sides:

4x = 29

Divide by 4:

x = 29/4

x = 7.25

Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number. Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% will learn synchronized dance, the remaining 25% will learn jersey dance, the rest will learn hip-hop dance, What percentage of all students will learn hip-hop dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 students will learn synchronized dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

25% of 20 students will learn jersey dance, which is 0.25 x 20 = 5 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 students to learn hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage, divide the number of students learning hip-hop by the total number of students, then multiply by 100:

(11 ÷ 20) x 100 = 55%

So, 55% of all students will learn hip-hop dance.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
15	The seller wants to choose between two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8000. His financial advisor sees that the jewelry market will rise 2.5% while the electronics market will rise 1.2% in the same month. If the seller wants to increase profits at the end of the month with his decision, what will be the profit?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = Principal x Rate
= $5,000 x 2.5%
= $5,000 x 0.025
= $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Profit = Principal x Rate
= $8,000 x 1.2%
= $8,000 x 0.012
= $96

To increase profits, the seller should choose the jewelry option, which will give a profit of $125.

16	Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin their journey westward, both traveling 80 miles. The next day they travel northward, covering 150 miles. What is the distance covered by each train on the two days?	230	"Ewe: Mie ena wo dometɔ ɖeka, miawo dometɔ ɖeka, wo dometɔ ɖeka wodze San Rafael. Wo dometɔ ɖeka wodze 80 mi awɔ. Esi wodze ɖeka wodze 150 mi awɔ. Mie ena wo dometɔ ɖeka wodze ɖeka wodze ɖeka wodze ɖeka wodze?

Translation: Both trains traveled the same distance, 80 miles on the first day, and 150 miles on the second day. So each train covered a total distance of 80 + 150 = 230 miles."

19	Marissa walks 12 miles. It took her one hour to walk 4 miles, another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) she needs to travel the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'll answer your question.

Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and 2 miles in the next hour, making it a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. She still needs to walk 12 - 6 = 6 miles to reach her goal. To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours. Therefore, her required speed is 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

20	I have 10 quarts of orange juice and I want to add 15 quarts of pineapple juice. But when I poured them, I spilled 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

10 quarts of orange juice = 9.46 liters (approx.)
15 quarts of pineapple juice = 14.19 liters (approx.)
Total juice = 9.46 + 14.19 = 23.65 liters

You spilled 1 liter of orange juice, so subtract that:
23.65 - 1 = 22.65 liters

Now, you asked how much water is left in 24 liters. But there's no water in the mixture, only juice! So, the answer is 0 liters of water.

Umsebenzi wam! (That's the job!)"
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son aged 23. If Samantha is 31 now, how old was Raymond's son?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 now, and Raymond was born 6 years before her, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond's son is 23 years old now. To find out how old Raymond's son was when Samantha was born, we subtract Samantha's age from Raymond's son's age: 23 - 31 = -8.

Since we can't have a negative age, we add the difference to Raymond's age at Samantha's birth: 37 - 31 = 6. So, Raymond was 6 years old when Samantha was born.

Now, we subtract Raymond's age at Samantha's birth from his son's current age: 23 - 6 = 17.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 17 years old when Samantha was born.

22	Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy DVDs for each customer. His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. His last 3 customers don't buy DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?	7	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's count!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Billy's first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers don't buy DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

In total, Billy sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

24	Kyle bought last year's book for $19.50. This is a 25% discount from the actual price. What is the actual price of the book?	26	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the actual price:

Let the actual price be x.

Discount = 25% of x = 0.25x

Price Kyle paid = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know Kyle paid $19.50, so:

0.75x = 19.50

x = 19.50 / 0.75

x = 26.00

So, the actual price of the book is $26.00.

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"
25	Marie ordered a chicken meal for $12.5 each, milk packets for $3 each, apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Marie's order:

* Chicken meals: $12.50 each (unknown quantity)
* Milk packets: $3 each (unknown quantity)
* Apples: $1.50 each (unknown quantity)
* Boxes of pizza: $8.50 each (unknown quantity)

Total cost: $50

Let's start by finding the total cost of the chicken meals, milk packets, and apples. Let's assume Marie ordered x chicken meals, y milk packets, and z apples.

Total cost of chicken meals, milk packets, and apples = 12.50x + 3y + 1.50z

We know the total cost is $50, so:

12.50x + 3y + 1.50z + 8.50p = 50

where p is the number of boxes of pizza.

Since we don't know the values of x, y, and z, let's try to find a combination that works. After some trial and error, we find:

x = 1, y = 2, z = 2, p = 2

So Marie ordered 1 chicken meal, 2 milk packets, 2 apples, and 2 boxes of pizza.

In Zulu, we can say: ""Marie wathenga izinhlobo zesichazamazwi, amaphakethe amabili, amafutha amabili, kanye nezinkundla zabhedha ezimbili."" (Marie ordered one chicken meal, two milk packets, two apples, and two boxes of pizza.)"
26	Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shorts costs $16.50. Each pair of pants costs $22.50 and each pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all these clothes?	243	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

3 pairs of shorts = 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
3 pairs of pants = 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
3 pairs of shoes = 3 x $42 = $126

Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all these clothes.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
27	Cynthia eats ice cream every night. She buys 15 packs of ice cream at $4.00 each. After 60 days, how much will she have spent on ice cream?	16	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Cynthia uyadla i-ice cream ngosuku olune. Uyabuyisa amapaki ayi-15 ase-$4.00 nganye. Emva kwemihla ayi-60, ingabe iphinde iphenduke kanjani ku-ice cream?""

Now, let's calculate: 15 packs/night × $4.00/pack = $60.00/night. After 60 days, she would have spent $60.00/night × 60 nights = $3600.00.

So, Cynthia will have spent $3600.00 on ice cream after 60 days!"
28	Henry makes two stops during his 60-mile journey. The first stop is after 20 miles. The second stop is 15 miles from the end of his journey. How many miles did he travel between the first and second stops?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi uHenry ubambe izindleko eziyi-20, futhi ususa ukuthi izindleko ezilandelayo ziyizindleko eziyi-15 kusuka kwesikhathi sokugcina. Kuthola ukuthi uHenry ubambe izindleko eziyi-60, ngakho izindleko ezibambe phakathi kwamazwe amabili yi-60 - 20 - 15 = 25.

(Translation: I think Henry traveled 20 miles, and then he says the next stop is 15 miles from the end of his journey. So, I think Henry traveled a total of 60 miles, so the distance between the two stops is 60 - 20 - 15 = 25.)"
29	Gloria wants to buy shoes when she sees the boots that fit her budget, but she has to choose between the boots and the high heels when together they cost five dollars less than the boots. If the high heels alone cost $33 and the others cost twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Let the cost of the boots be x.

The high heels cost $33.

The boots and high heels together cost $5 less than the boots, so the total cost is x - 5.

We know that the boots cost twice as much as the high heels, so x = 2 × 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation:

x - 5 = x + 33

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-5 = 33

So, the boots cost $66.

30	If their average age is now 162 years, count Allen's age ten years from now	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Allen's age ten years from now. Since their average age is 162 years, that means Allen's current age is also 162 years.

To find his age ten years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

162 + 10 = 172

So, ten years from now, Allen's age will be 172 years.

31	Gunter tries to count the beans out of the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80, another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What is the average of their guesses?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 80/2 = 40. So, 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 80/2 = 40. 25% of 40 is 10, so 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33

So, the average of their guesses is 63.33.

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, Terry will eat 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt in 30 days, multiply the number of yogurts by the cost of 1 yogurt: 60 yogurts x $1.25 = $75.00.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Terry uyakhula i-yogurt ezili-2 ngosuku. I-yogurt ezili-4 ziyahlukaniswa ngama-$5.00. Unyaka kanjani u-Terry uyakhokela i-yogurt ngomhlaka 30?"""
37	John plans to sell his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 sets of legos and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many sets of legos do you have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much John made from selling his legos:

13 sets of legos × $15 each = $195

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so he spent:

8 video games × $20 each = $160

He had $5 left, so he spent $195 - $5 = $190 in total.

Since he spent $190 on video games, he didn't have any legos left. He sold all 13 sets!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"

39	Dana can run at four times the speed of walking but can jump at half the speed of running. If she can jump 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends a quarter of her time running and two quarters of her time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dana can jump at half the speed of running, and she can jump 3 miles per hour. So, her running speed is 2 × 3 = 6 miles per hour.
2. Her walking speed is one-quarter of her running speed, which is 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
3. She spends one-quarter of her time running, which is 1.5 hours (out of 6 hours).
4. She spends two-quarters of her time walking, which is 3 hours (out of 6 hours).
5. Distance = Speed × Time. For running, it's 6 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 9 miles. For walking, it's 1.5 miles/hour × 3 hours = 4.5 miles.
6. Total distance traveled is 9 miles + 4.5 miles = 13.5 miles.

42	Grandma Jones bakes five apple pies for the firefighter's lunch. She cuts each pie into eight pieces and places five pies on the dining table for the guests to help themselves to. By the end of the day, after the guests have eaten their pies, there are 14 pies left. How many pies have the guests taken?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the pies, my friend!

Grandma Jones baked 5 pies, and each pie has 8 pieces. So, there are 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie in total.

If there are 14 pieces left, that means the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.

Since each pie has 8 pieces, the guests ate 26 ÷ 8 = 3.25 pies. But we can't have a quarter of a pie, so let's round down to 3 pies.

The answer is: Akukho ukudla okungenani amapayi angu-3! (There are 3 pies that are not eaten!)"
43	According to nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories each. If a 300g bag is eaten 5 times, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A bag of chips has 250 calories.
* You've eaten 5 bags, so that's 5 x 250 = 1250 calories from chips.
* You've already eaten 1800 calories, and you want to reach 2000 calories.
* So, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.
* Since each bag has 250 calories, you can have 200 / 250 = 0.8 bags left.
* Since each bag is 300g, you can have 0.8 x 300g = 240g left.

44	Charlie wants to sell honey cake candles. For every pound of honey cake he can make 10 candles. A pound of honey cake and string can cost $10 to the vendors. If he sells each candle for $2.00 what is the direct profit if he sells 20 candles?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 pound of honey cake makes 10 candles.
Cost of 1 pound of honey cake and string = $10.
Selling price of each candle = $2.

To find the direct profit, we need to calculate the revenue and then subtract the cost.

Revenue = Number of candles sold x Selling price per candle
= 20 candles x $2
= $40

Cost = Cost of 1 pound of honey cake and string
= $10

Direct Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40 - $10
= $30

Umsebenzi wakhe! (Good work!) Charlie's direct profit is $30.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Impumelelo yakhe iyisi-30."" (His profit is thirty.)"

46	Candice put 80 note stickers in her purse before she left for work at the coffee shop. On the way she stopped at the store and bought a pack of note stickers. At work she put one note stickers in each of 220 different cups of coffee. If she had 23 note stickers left, how many note stickers were in the pocket she bought?	163	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Candice bekwele 80 amastiki empurse yakhe ngaphambi kokuthola ukuya eshopu lesikofi. Ngakusasa, wabonga iphekhi lemastiki. Ekuseni, wathatha amastiki amnye ku-220 ukudla kwesikofi. Uma bekwele 23 amastiki engaphandle, inani lemastiki ekhokhelwe kwiphekhi yakhe?

Now, let's calculate:

Candice had 80 stickers initially.
She used 1 sticker per cup for 220 cups, so she used 220 stickers.
She had 23 stickers left, so she had 80 + x - 220 = 23, where x is the number of stickers she bought.
Rearranging the equation, we get x = 220 - 23 + 80 = 277.

Kepha, iphekhi yakhe yakhe yakho 277 amastiki! (So, the pack she bought had 277 stickers!)"
47	John buys twice as many red ties as green ties. Red ties cost 50% more than green ties. He spent $200 on green ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the tie?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spent $200 on green ties, and each green tie costs $40, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 green ties

Since he buys twice as many red ties as green ties, he bought:

2 × 5 = 10 red ties

Red ties cost 50% more than green ties, so each red tie costs:

$40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

He spent on red ties:

10 ties × $60 = $600

In total, John spent:

$200 (green ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

Let's break it down:

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments, so the total number of apartments is:
15 x 8 = 120 apartments

3/4 of the building is occupied, which means 1/4 is empty. To find the number of empty apartments, multiply the total number of apartments by 1/4:
120 x 1/4 = 30 apartments

So, there are 30 empty apartments in the building.

51	Tom's boat can go 10 miles an hour. He'll leave at 1 to 4 p.m. He can go back at 6 mph. How long will it take him to get back?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tom's boat goes 10 miles per hour. If he leaves at 1 to 4 p.m., that's 3 hours. Distance = Speed x Time, so he'll cover a distance of 10 mph x 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, to get back, he'll travel at 6 mph. To find the time, we use Time = Distance / Speed. Plugging in the values, we get Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, it'll take Tom 5 hours to get back.

Let's break it down:

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.
He removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound, so that's a total of:
30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds removed.

He still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove:
7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15 toys.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Now, let's calculate Marcy's annual pension:

After 20 years, she's entitled to 5% of the annual pension amount, which is $50,000. So, she gets 5% of $50,000 = $2,500 per year.

Since she retires after 30 years, she'll receive the full pension amount, which is $50,000, plus the additional 10 years of 5% increments (30 - 20 = 10 years). That's 10 x $2,500 = $25,000.

Her annual pension will be $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

64	Sophia is thinking about taking a road trip in her car, and she would like to know how far she can drive with one gas tank. She has driven 100 miles for the last fill-up and needs to put in 4 gallons of gas for the next fill-up. Her owner's manual says that her gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive with one gas tank?	300	"Akwaaba! (Welcome!)

In Twi, I'll respond: ""Ɛwɔ Sophia bɛtɛ 360 mɔli a ɔtɛnkyɛn"" (Sophia can drive 360 miles with one gas tank).

Here's the calculation:
100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon
12 gallons x 25 miles per gallon = 300 miles
However, since Sophia needs to fill up 4 gallons, she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left. So, she can drive:
8 gallons x 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles
Adding this to the 100 miles she's already driven, Sophia can drive a total of:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles
But since she can fill up her tank, she can drive the full 300 miles, plus the additional 60 miles (12 gallons - 8 gallons = 4 gallons, which is equivalent to 60 miles). Therefore, Sophia can drive a total of:
300 miles + 60 miles = 360 miles with one gas tank!"

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half the time, which is 2/2 = 1 hour.

So, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV and reading per day.

67	A wealthy hunter found a buried treasure in a bowl full of filth. 175 diamonds, a few rubies in 35 diamonds, twice as many emeralds in rubies. How much filth was in this bowl?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* 175 diamonds
* A few rubies in 35 diamonds means 35 diamonds have rubies. Let's assume ""a few"" means 5 rubies in each of the 35 diamonds, so there are 35 x 5 = 175 rubies.
* Twice as many emeralds in rubies means 2 x 175 rubies = 350 emeralds.

Now, let's count the total number of precious stones: 175 diamonds + 175 rubies + 350 emeralds = 700 precious stones.

The question asks about the filth, but there's no information about the filth. The problem only talks about the treasure! So, the answer is ""we don't know"" or ""there's no information about the filth.""

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Akukho ukwazi mayelana nomthondo."" (There's no information about the filth.)"
68	There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

There are twice as many boys as girls, so the number of boys is 2 x 60 = 120.

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, the number of teachers is 180 ÷ 5 = 36.

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

69	Bailey started with a certain amount of money. He earns $5 a week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks if he has a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Bailey wayeqala ngani? (Let me calculate how much Bailey started with?)

Bailey earned $5 a week for 8 weeks, so he earned a total of:

$5/week x 8 weeks = $40

If he had a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, that means he started with:

$100 - $40 = $60

Kusho ukuthi Bailey wayeqala ngama-$60. (It means Bailey started with $60.)"
70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day on weekends and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students costing $15.00 per student, how much does she make in one week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Weekends (Sat and Sun): 2 days x 5 classes/day = 10 classes
Saturday: 1 day x 8 classes/day = 8 classes
Total classes in a week: 10 + 8 = 18 classes

Each class has 15 students, so total students in a week: 18 classes x 15 students/class = 270 students

Each student pays $15, so total earnings in a week: 270 students x $15/student = $4050

72	Tommy raises money for his charity by selling $3 rice cakes and $4 rice cakes. If Tommy sells 43 cakes and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money has Tommy raised?	221	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tommy sells 2 types of rice cakes: $3 and $4. We don't know how many of each type he sold, but we know he sold 43 in total. Let's assume he sold x $3 rice cakes and (43 - x) $4 rice cakes.

The total amount of money from rice cakes is:
3x + 4(43 - x) = 3x + 172 - 4x = 172 - x

Tommy also sold 23 slices of cheesecake, but we don't know the price. Let's assume it's y dollars per slice. Then, the total amount from cheesecakes is:
23y

The total amount Tommy raised is the sum of the amounts from rice cakes and cheesecakes:
172 - x + 23y

Unfortunately, we can't find the exact amount without knowing the price of the cheesecake (y) and the number of $3 rice cakes (x). But we can express the total amount in terms of these variables.

73	Sheila bought five phones for $150 each to be paid in installments for three months. 2% of the profit will be calculated for each phone. How much will Sheila pay each month for the three months?	255	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

5 phones × $150 = $750 (total cost)

2% of $150 = $3 (profit per phone)
5 phones × $3 = $15 (total profit)
$750 (total cost) + $15 (total profit) = $765 (total amount to be paid)

To be paid in 3 months:
$765 ÷ 3 = $255 (monthly installment)

74	Artie has a flower shop at the Farmer's Market. He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 a jar, petunias for $1.87 a jar, and begonias for $2.12 a jar. Artie doesn't have an exchange today, so he's decided to round up all the prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 of petunias, and 17 of begonias, how much will he make?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Artie will make:

Marigolds: 12 pots x $3 (rounded up from $2.74) = $36
Petunias: 9 pots x $2 (rounded up from $1.87) = $18
Begonias: 17 pots x $2 (rounded up from $2.12) = $34

Total amount: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88.

75	Luke spends time at sea building sand houses. Eventually he realizes that each level of the sand house will be half as square as the level below it. If he constructs 4 levels of the sand house with the top level having a travel square of 16, what is the average square of the level?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Ukuqala, sizokwazi ukuthola ukuba umlando wokuqala uwumlando owodwa ku-16. (First, we can determine that the top level is 16.)

Umlandu wesibili uwumlando owodwa ku-16 x 2 = 32. (The second level is 16 x 2 = 32.)

Umlandu wesithathu uwumlando owodwa ku-32 x 2 = 64. (The third level is 32 x 2 = 64.)

Umlandu wesine uwumlando owodwa ku-64 x 2 = 128. (The fourth level is 64 x 2 = 128.)

Manje, sizokwazi ukucophelela ukuba isilinganiso siyi-128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240. (Now, we can calculate the total to be 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240.)

Isilinganiso esihle siyi-240 / 4 = 60. (The average is 240 / 4 = 60.)

Ngithola ukuthi isilinganiso esihle siyi-60! (I find that the average is 60!)"
76	Cecilia has bought a new puppy. According to the veterinarian, she must feed the puppy one cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that she will feed him two cups of dog food every day for the rest of his life. If one bag of dog food has 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day, so she'll need:
180 days × 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After that, she'll feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she'll need:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days × 2 cups/day = 370 cups

In total, she'll need:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag has 110 cups, she'll need:
550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 more than David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does the laundry by 400 pounds	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
David does 4 less than Sarah, so David does 400 - 4 = 396 pounds.
Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David is 396 - 200 = 196 pounds.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukudlula kwabaRaymond noDavid kuyindlela yokugcina kwama-pounds ayi-196."" (The difference between Raymond and David is 196 pounds of laundry.)"
78	Vincent can buy flowers for 3 packs of $2.50 or for 2 packs of $1. How much money do you save by buying 18 flowers at a better price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at both prices:

**Option 1: 3 packs of $2.50**
To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packs (18 ÷ 3 = 6).
Cost = 6 packs × $2.50 = $15.00

**Option 2: 2 packs of $1.00**
To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packs (18 ÷ 2 = 9).
Cost = 9 packs × $1.00 = $9.00

By buying at the better price (Option 2), Vincent saves:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

Itrainer ithola isilinganiso sesikhathi sesishiyagalolunye (The trainer gives a 30% discount)

Isilinganiso sesikhathi sesishiyagalolunye = 30% x $100 = $30

Igazi elinganiselwe = $100 - $30 = $70

Kuthiwa igazi elinganiselwe lithola ukuthengisa ukufundisa kwesokudla kusuka ku-$100 ukuya ku-$70. (So, the discounted price for training is $70.)"
80	Two girls each have 1/6 of 24 liters of water. The boy has 6 liters of water. How many liters of water are left?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two girls each have 1/6 of 24 liters, so each girl has:
24 ÷ 6 = 4 liters
Together, they have: 4 + 4 = 8 liters

The boy has 6 liters, so together they have: 8 + 6 = 14 liters

Initially, there were 24 liters. To find out how many liters are left:
24 - 14 = 10 liters

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 10 liters of water left.

Let's count Charlie's stickers:

* He started with 10 stickers.
* He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
* He received 23 more for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
* He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
* He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Charlie has 17 stickers left. Ukuthula! (Goodbye!)"

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight, so:
Alex's weight = 4 × 125 - 2 = 498 pounds

Their combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

85	Gene sews a quilt from the fabric of his T-shirt. He has one quilt for each shirt he has made. Each shirt has its own quilt. Each row is made up of blocks from different seasonal resorts. He travels four times a year and has been traveling since he was 23. Now he has 34. How many quilt blocks do you have in total?	44	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Gene travels 4 times a year, and he's been traveling since he was 23. Now he's 34, so he's been traveling for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In 11 years, he's traveled 4 times a year, so that's 11 x 4 = 44 trips.

Each trip has its own quilt, and each quilt has blocks from different seasonal resorts. Since each row is made up of blocks from different resorts, we can assume each quilt has at least one row. Let's assume each quilt has only one row (to keep it simple).

So, Gene has 44 quilts, and each quilt has at least one row of blocks. That means he has at least 44 rows of blocks.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""U-Gene uneziqu ze-44 eziyinhloko!"" (Gene has 44 quilt blocks!)

But wait, there's more! We don't know how many blocks are in each row. Let's assume each row has at least 5 blocks (a rough estimate). Then, Gene would have 44 rows x 5 blocks per row = 220 blocks!

In isiZulu, we can say: ""U-Gene uneziqu ze-220 eziyinhloko!"" (Gene has 220 quilt blocks!)

So, the answer is at least 220 quilt blocks!"

87	The company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each employee by 10% of the starting salary each year for those who have worked for the company for five years. If Sylvie has worked for the company for five years last December, what is her annual salary after three years of work?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sylvie's initial salary is $600/month. Since it's a monthly salary, we need to find her annual salary, which is $600 × 12 = $7,200/year.

After 1 year, her salary increases by 10% of the starting salary, which is $7,200 × 0.10 = $720. So, her new annual salary is $7,200 + $720 = $7,920/year.

After 2 years, her salary increases again by 10% of the starting salary, which is still $7,200 × 0.10 = $720. So, her new annual salary is $7,920 + $720 = $8,640/year.

After 3 years, her salary increases once more by 10% of the starting salary, which is still $7,200 × 0.10 = $720. So, her new annual salary is $8,640 + $720 = $9,360/year.

So, after three years, Sylvie's annual salary is $9,360.

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 won't come. To find 1/4 of 16, multiply 16 by 0.25 = 4. So, 4 friends won't come.

That means 16 - 4 = 12 friends will attend.

She needs 75 gift bags for each guest, so she'll need 12 x 75 = 900 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be 900 x 2 = $1800.

93	Lee was able to run the 40-meter hurdles in two minutes faster than Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his eating habits, which increased his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 minutes, how fast can Gerald, having changed his eating habits, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Let's break it down:

Lee runs the 40-meter hurdles in 2 minutes less than Gerald's 400-meter hurdles time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 minutes, Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, Gerald increases his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40 minutes, multiply by 0.1: 40 × 0.1 = 4 minutes. So, Gerald's new time would be 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

To convert 36 minutes to seconds, multiply by 60: 36 × 60 = 2160 seconds.

95	Of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are girl scouts. How many girls are not in the scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the number of boys be B and the number of girls be G. We know that B + G = 200.

Since 2/5 of the boys are girl scouts, the number of boy scouts is (2/5)B.

Since 2/3 of the girls are girl scouts, the number of girl scouts is (2/3)G.

The total number of scouts is (2/5)B + (2/3)G. We know that this is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who are not scouts.

Let's say the number of girls who are not scouts is x. Then, the number of students who are not scouts is x + (B - (2/5)B) = x + (3/5)B.

So, we can set up the equation: 200 - (x + (3/5)B) = (2/5)B + (2/3)G.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + (3/5)B = 200 - (2/5)B - (2/3)G.

Since B + G = 200, we can substitute G = 200 - B.

x + (3/5)B = 200 - (2/5)B - (2/3)(200 - B).

Simplifying further, we get: x + (3/5)B = 200 - (2/5)B - (400/3) + (2/3)B.

Combine like terms: x + (3/5)B = (600 - 400)/3 - (2/5 - 2/3)B.

x + (3/5)B = 200/3 - (1/15)B.

Now, we need to find the value of x. Let's assume that the number of boys is 80 (B = 80). Then, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120 (G = 120).

Substituting these values, we get: x + (3/5)(80) = 200/3 - (1/15)(80).

x + 48 = 200/3 - 16/3.

x + 48 = 184/3.

x = 184/3 - 48.

x = (184 - 144)/3.

x = 40/3.

x = 13.33 (approximately).

So, approximately 13 girls are not in the scouts.

97	When Freda cooks the tomatoes in the sauce, she loses half the weight. Each of the 16 tomatoes has an average weight of a cup of tomatoes that she uses carrying three tomatoes. Freda's last tomatoes in the sauce made an average weight of 32 tomatoes. How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Freda loses half the weight when cooking, so if she's left with 32 tomatoes' worth of sauce, she must have started with 32 x 2 = 64 tomatoes' worth.

Each of the 16 tomatoes has an average weight of a cup of tomatoes that she uses carrying three tomatoes, so each cup is equivalent to 3 tomatoes. Therefore, 64 tomatoes is equal to 64 / 3 = 21.33 cups (let's round up to 22 cups).

Since each 3 tomatoes make a cup, Freda used 22 cups x 3 tomatoes/cup = 66 tomatoes.

If there were 30 cars on the road, how many cars were driven past the traffic jam in 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 30 cars were on the road initially.
* 5 cars pulled out to avoid the traffic jam, leaving 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
* 20 cars drove past the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.
* To find the number of cars that drove past the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, subtract 20 from 25: 25 - 20 = 5.

Let's count the number of potted plants Mary already has: 2 potted plants in each window, and we don't know how many windows she has, so let's call it ""x"" windows. That means she has 2x potted plants already.

She got 18 new potted plants, so in total, she has 2x + 18 potted plants.

She will give 1 potted plant to her friends and family, so she'll be left with 2x + 18 - 1 = 2x + 17 potted plants.

Unfortunately, we don't know the number of windows (x), so we can't give an exact number. But we can express the answer as 2x + 17.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""UMary uyothola amapoti angu-2x + 17."" (Mary will have 2x + 17 potted plants.)"
100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend pressed the doorbell a quarter more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell a quarter more than the first friend, which is 20 + (20/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times the doorbell rang:

20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

So, the doorbell rang 175 times!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
101	Solo has read 4 pages of Science, 20 pages of Social Studies, 7 pages of his History, and 8 pages of his Geography. He has read 15 pages on Monday.

106	John has three boxes. Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal thickness of the three boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Each box has an internal volume of:
(5 - 2) x (6 - 2) x (4 - 2) = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are three boxes, the total internal volume is:
24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

Now, to find the total internal surface area, we need to calculate the area of each box and multiply by 3:
(3 x 4) x 2 + (3 x 2) x 2 + (4 x 2) x 2 = 24 + 12 + 16 = 52 square inches per box
52 x 3 = 156 square inches

So, the total internal surface area is 156 square inches.

107	Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches his favorite hour-long episode every night. On Wednesday, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute movie. On Friday, he has to stay up late for the weekend, so he watches two hour-long episodes. If he watches TV for a total of 7 hours, how many of the 30 episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watches 1 hour-long episode each night, so that's 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watches 1 hour-long episode and a 30-minute movie, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watches 2 hour-long episodes, which is 2 hours.

In total, that's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watches TV for a total of 7 hours, the remaining time is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Wednesday, he watches 30-minute episodes, so he watches 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes.

108	Henry bakes the cakes for the local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he has baked 15 more cakes than he intended. He drops 5 cakes when he takes them out to cool off and now has a total of 110 cakes. How many cakes did Henry bake last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Henry wants to make twice as many cakes as he did last year, but ends up making 15 more than intended. So, if he intended to make 2x, he actually made 2x + 15.

When he drops 5 cakes, he's left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We know he has 110 cakes left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cakes last year.

Let's calculate the total cost of gas:

10 gallons x $300/gallon = $3000

Now, let's calculate the cashback reward:

10 gallons x $0.20/gallon = $2

So, the total cost of gas after the cashback reward is:

$3000 - $2 = $2998

110	Marcel and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the rolled-up fruit, as they peel off as many as they can find. Unfortunately, one makes a mistake and Beatrice has 24 rolled-up long and 24 rolled-up long while Marcel has 3 rolled-up wide and 14 rolled-up long. If both have eaten everything, how much have they eaten on average?	45	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's count the rolled-up fruits:

Beatrice has 24 rolled-up long and 24 rolled-up long, so she has 24 + 24 = 48 rolled-up fruits.

Marcel has 3 rolled-up wide and 14 rolled-up long, so he has 3 + 14 = 17 rolled-up fruits.

Together, they have 48 + 17 = 65 rolled-up fruits.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 65 ÷ 2 = 32.5.

So, on average, they have eaten 32.5 rolled-up fruits each.

111	Julia had a leaky boat when she was on the island. The boat took two liters of water for ten dives and paddled back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to paddle twenty dives. It took 64 seconds to reach shore. How much water did the boat take when Julia reached shore?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

For 10 dives, the boat took 2 liters of water. To find out how much water it takes for 1 dive, we divide 2 liters by 10 dives:

2 liters ÷ 10 dives = 0.2 liters per dive

Now, Julia paddled 20 dives in 16 seconds. To find out how many dives she did in 64 seconds, we multiply 20 dives by the ratio of 64 seconds to 16 seconds:

20 dives × (64 seconds ÷ 16 seconds) = 20 dives × 4 = 80 dives

Finally, we multiply the number of dives by the amount of water taken per dive to find out how much water the boat took when Julia reached shore:

80 dives × 0.2 liters per dive = 16 liters

So, the boat took 16 liters of water when Julia reached shore.

Let's break it down:

Jamal's phone can store 1800 pictures.
Brittany's phone can store 6 less pictures than Jamal's, so it can store 1800 - 6 = 1794 pictures.
Brittany's phone can store 50 more pictures than the number of birds in Jamal's duck photos. So, the number of birds in Jamal's duck photos is 1794 - 50 = 1744.

For the 4x4x10 boards: 5 boards x $16 each = $80
Total revenue: $100 + $80 = $180

Since Sasha wants to know the profit, we need to know how much she spent on the boards initially. Unfortunately, that information is not provided. However, we can express the answer in terms of the initial cost.

Let the initial cost be x. Then, the profit would be:
Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost
= $180 - x

So, Sasha's profit would be $180 minus the initial cost."""
116	Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio 7:13 if she uses a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, count the number of full teaspoons of sugar she has used?	42	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. To find the total parts, add 7 + 13 = 20. Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, divide 120 by 20 to get 6. This means she used 6 sets of the ratio.

To find the number of full teaspoons of sugar, multiply 6 by 7 (the sugar part of the ratio). That's 6 × 7 = 42.

So, Katy used 42 full teaspoons of sugar.

118	A dock worker at the main port of SeaSide counted the number of outgoing containers. One container had 5 cars in it. The next day more containers were brought in, and the total number of cars at the port was 30. Count the number of outgoing containers on the second day, assuming that each container had 5 cars.	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On the first day, one container had 5 cars, so the total number of cars was 5.

On the second day, the total number of cars became 30. To find out how many cars were added, we subtract the initial number from the total: 30 - 5 = 25.

Since each container has 5 cars, we divide the number of added cars by 5 to find the number of containers: 25 ÷ 5 = 5.

So, there were 5 outgoing containers on the second day.

119	Adrien's total salary was 30 percent more than Lylah's. After four years her salary had increased and she was earning 40% more than she did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary both of them were earning in four years.	95200	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, so if Lylah's salary was x, Adrien's salary would be x + 30% of x = x + 0.3x = 1.3x.
2. Since Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation: 1.3x = 40,000.
3. To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3: x = 40,000 / 1.3 = 30,769.
4. After four years, Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so her new salary is 30,769 + 40% of 30,769 = 30,769 + 0.4(30,769) = 43,000.
5. Since Adrien's salary increased at the same rate, his new salary is also 40% more than his original salary: 40,000 + 0.4(40,000) = 56,000.
6. The total salary both of them were earning in four years is the sum of their new salaries: 43,000 + 56,000 = 99,000.

Let's break it down:

Morisette brought back 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought back a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought back two and a half times as many apples as Morisette, so he brought back 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 apples. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, let's round it up to 13 apples.

In total, they have 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 13 (Kael's apples) = 26 fruits.

129	The clinic sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 an hour at the clinic and at the clinic patients charge $200 an hour. How much profit does the clinic make from visits?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

1. The clinic sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent with patients, we convert minutes to hours: 24 minutes = 0.4 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time spent with patients is 500 patients × 0.4 hours = 200 hours.
2. Doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost of doctors' time is 200 hours × $150 = $30,000.
3. Patients are charged $200 an hour, so the total revenue from patients is 200 hours × $200 = $40,000.
4. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the clinic makes a profit of $10,000 from visits.

130	Nissa hired 60 temporary workers to play elves in her department store in Santa village. A third of the elves quit after the children spat on them, and the remaining 10 children quit after the children spanked them. How many elves are left?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Nissa yakwetha amaqhizi amathathu asixoxisayo (Nissa hired 60 temporary workers)

A third of 60 is 20, so amaqhizi amahlanu athola ukudla ngabantwana (20 elves quit after being spat on by children)

Now we have 60 - 20 = 40 amaqhizi asesiphelile (remaining elves)

Then, amaqhizi amashumi asihlanu athola ukubopha ngabantwana (10 elves quit after being spanked by children)

So, we have 40 - 10 = 30 amaqhizi asesiphelile (remaining elves)

Kuthola, amaqhizi amathathu asesiphelile (there are 30 elves left)

Sawubona!"
131	Joseph's expenses in May were $500. In June, his expenses were $60 less. What were his total expenses for the two months?	940	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi uJoseph wayenemali yokuthenga eMay kwaba $500. EJune, imali yakhe yokuthenga yayiphansi ngama-$60. Imali yakhe yokuthenga eyodwa kwaba $500 + ($500 - $60) = $940.

(UJoseph had $500 in May. In June, his expenses were $60 less. His total expenses were $500 + ($500 - $60) = $940.)

132	Pam and Fred went to Carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, they each chose to ride the luge twice. If each ticket costs 6, how many tickets did they use per day?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. That's a total of 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides.

Then, they each rode the luge twice, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they had 6 roller coaster rides + 4 luge rides = 10 rides.

Each ticket costs 6, so they used 10 rides / 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets per day.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
133	On Monday, Walt traveled 4 miles. On Tuesday, he traveled 6 times as many miles as he had traveled on Monday. The total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday was 41. How many miles did he travel on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt traveled 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he traveled 6 times as many miles, so that's 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
The total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
To find out how many miles he traveled on Wednesday, we subtract the miles from Monday and Tuesday from the total: 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt traveled 13 miles on Wednesday.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
134	Tom found 4 car washes. If a car wash costs $15 how much do you pay per year?	720	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

135	Brian's friend Bobby has 5 less than 3 times as much time on video games as Brian does. If Brian has 20 video games but lost the rights to 5 before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?	40	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I'm happy to help with the conversation!)

Let's break it down:

Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 3 times as much as Brian, which is 3 x 15 = 45.

But Bobby has 5 less than that, so he has 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

136	There are 27 unicorns left in the world. A third of the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. How many female Scottish unicorns are there?	6	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* A third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 unicorns.
* Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so that's 2/3 × 9 = 6 female unicorns.

Sawubona! (Hello!) There are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
137	Rory bought 2 meals for $7.50 each and 2 cakes for $1.00 each to ship. There's a 20% shipping charge added when you're done and a $5.00 tip. How much will it cost to ship the goods?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Meals: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Cakes: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $2.00 = $17.00
Shipping charge (20%): $17.00 x 0.20 = $3.40
Tip: $5.00
Total to ship: $17.00 + $3.40 + $5.00 = $25.40

138	Mark wrote a questionnaire yesterday which had 75 questions. He finished the questionnaire in a hurry which indicates that he answered 5 questions in an hour. Today, he wrote another questionnaire with 100 questions in the same way. If Mark had 8 hours to finish the questionnaire and 6 hours to finish the second one, how many questions did he leave unanswered?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday, Mark answered 5 questions per hour. He had the questionnaire with 75 questions. To find out how many hours it took him to finish, divide 75 by 5: 75 ÷ 5 = 15 hours. But he finished it in a hurry, so he must have rushed through it.

Today, Mark has 8 hours to finish the questionnaire with 100 questions. If he answers 5 questions per hour, he can answer: 8 hours × 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

He has 100 questions, but he can only answer 40. So, he left: 100 - 40 = 60 questions unanswered.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
139	In a candy machine, there are 22 and four times as many pink gamballs as blue gamballs. If there are 12 blue gamballs, how many pink ones are there?	70	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (I'm happy to answer your question!)

Let's break it down: if there are 12 blue gamballs, and there are four times as many pink gamballs as blue gamballs, that means we need to multiply 12 by 4 to get the number of pink gamballs.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Kubalwa ku-12, kuya kuba ku-4 kuya kuba ku-?"", which means ""If it's 12, and it's 4 times, how many is it?""

So, 12 x 4 = 48. Kungenzani! (That's correct!) There are 48 pink gamballs."
140	Of the 20 rental cars available, 12 are automatic, 4 have automatic gears, and some cars are automatically changed. What is the percentage of cars that are automatically changed?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 12 cars are automatic.
* 4 cars have automatic gears, which means they are also automatic.
* Since 12 already includes the 4 with automatic gears, we don't count them twice.
* The question asks about ""automatically changed"" cars, which is unclear, but let's assume it means the ones that are not automatic (manual transmission).
* There are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic, so 20 - 12 = 8 cars are not automatic (manual transmission).
* To find the percentage, divide the number of manual transmission cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100: (8 ÷ 20) × 100 = 40%

So, 40% of the cars are automatically changed (manual transmission).

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
141	There are 700 bees in the hive. There are many times as many worker bees as honeybees, and twice as many honeybees as honeybees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Kunezinhlanhla zama-bee ezinhlanhla ku-hive (There are 700 bees in the hive)

Kunezinhlanhla zama-bee ezisebenzayo eziningi kakhulu kunezinhlanhla zama-bee ezinomthakathi (There are many times as many worker bees as honeybees)

Kunezinhlanhla zama-bee ezinomthakathi ezine-zinhlanhla zama-bee ezinomthakathi (and twice as many honeybees as honeybees)

Let's assume the number of honeybees is x. Then, the number of worker bees is 2x, and the total number of bees is x + 2x = 3x.

Since there are 700 bees in total, we can set up the equation:

3x = 700

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 233.33 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 233 honeybees. Since there are twice as many honeybees as honeybees, there are 2 × 233 = 466 honeybees.

Now, let's find the number of worker bees:

Number of worker bees = Total number of bees - Number of honeybees
= 700 - 466
= 234

Kusho ukuthi kunezinhlanhla zama-bee ezisebenzayo ezingu-234! (So, there are 234 worker bees!)"
142	Jordan plays video games for two hours every day. He had a part-time job where he earned $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in one week if he used video game time to work on his toys?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. If he uses that time to work, he can earn 2 hours x $10/hour = $20/day.

In one week, Jordan can earn $20/day x 7 days = $140.

143	John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, cereals for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. If he has a 10% tax on nonfood items, how much did you charge him?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Food items: $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $3 (cereals) = $8
Non-food items: $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $7
Tax on non-food items: $7 x 0.10 = $0.70
Total cost: $8 + $7 + $0.70 = $15.70

144	Kim has already started his housecleaning business and calculated how much profit he will make for his people. He still has 3 people, but he is talking to five potential people and feels completely confident to include them in his calculations. Each of his people's homes will need 2 bottles of bleach and a good cleaning cloth. The bleach bottles cost $2 each and the cloths will cost $5 each. Those are his expenses. He calculates that his salary for one week is $92. The profit is the difference between the salary and all the expenses, so what is the profit, in dollars, would Lucasou make each week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Kim's expenses:

* 8 people (3 existing + 5 potential) x 2 bottles of bleach/person = 16 bottles of bleach
* 16 bottles of bleach x $2/bottle = $32
* 8 people x 1 cloth/person = 8 cloths
* 8 cloths x $5/cloth = $40
* Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72
* Salary = $92
* Profit = Salary - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Kim's profit each week is $20.

145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple in the field. There are 1000 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi una impumelelo yokucophelela ukudla kwakhe. (I want to help you with the calculation of his harvest.)

UJohn une hectare eziyi-10 ze pineapple. (John has 10 hectares of pineapple.)

Ku hectare eyodwa, kukhona amapineapple ayi-1000. (In one hectare, there are 1000 pineapples.)

UJohn angacophela ngokuthi ngamanye amasonto ayi-3. (John can harvest every 3 months.)

Izinyanga zonyaka ziyisi-4. (There are 4 quarters in a year.)

Ukuthi uJohn angacophela ngokuthi ngamanye amasonto ayi-3, kufanele siqonde ukuthi angacophela ngokuthi ngamanye izinyanga zonyaka ziyisi-4. (Since John can harvest every 3 months, we must consider that he can harvest 4 times a year.)

Ukuba uJohn une hectare eziyi-10, angacophela amapineapple ayi-10 000 ngokuthi ngamanye izinyanga zonyaka ziyisi-1. (If John has 10 hectares, he can harvest 10,000 pineapples per quarter.)

Ngokuthi ngamanye izinyanga zonyaka ziyisi-4, uJohn angacophela amapineapple ayi-40 000 ngonyaka. (Since there are 4 quarters in a year, John can harvest 40,000 pineapples per year.)

146	Johnny picks up the toys on the floor of the house. He had already dropped a box of lego sets with 500 pieces on the floor, and some others had 3 more sets of 500 pieces each, some are 1/4 of the number of pieces. How many bricks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the lego boxes?	2,125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the Lego pieces:

1 box with 500 pieces (already dropped) = 500
3 more sets of 500 pieces each = 3 x 500 = 1500
Some are 1/4 of the number of pieces = 1/4 x 500 = 125

Total number of Lego pieces = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego bricks.

147	Debra monitors a hive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then sees 1/2 of those bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as she saw leave the hive flying away in 6 hours. And other bees left before they returned to the hive in 6 hours. How many bees has Debra seen return in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.
In the next 6 hours, half of those bees returned, which is 30 ÷ 2 = 15 bees.
Then, twice as many bees as she saw leave the hive flew away, which is 2 × 30 = 60 bees.
And some other bees left before returning to the hive in 6 hours. Since we don't know the exact number, let's call it x.

Now, let's focus on the last 6 hours. We want to find out how many bees returned. We know 15 bees returned earlier, and some other bees returned, which is x. So, the total number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is x.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthi abe yi-15 neyi-x ibhele ngemuva kwezinhlanu zokugcina.""

(Translation: ""It's great to find out that 15 and x bees returned in the last six hours."")

So, the answer is x + 15. However, without more information, we can't determine the exact value of x."

150	Steve and Tim have a competition to see who will be the first to get home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away from Tim, so he is allowed to ride a bike. Steve lives 3 miles away from school and the bike is 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet
Steve's speed: 440 feet/minute

Time taken by Steve: Distance / Speed = 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes

Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet
Tim's speed: 264 feet/minute

Time taken by Tim: Distance / Speed = 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. Steve will wait at home for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim finishes.

In isiZulu, ""Izolo uSteve uzowinwa umgudu, uTim uzokuvuka emzansi ngemini engu-4."" (Yesterday Steve won the race, Tim will arrive 4 minutes later.)

On the first day, 5 cyclists came to spray both tires. Three came to spray all their tires. Finally, one came with a one-wheel bicycle. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! Let me calculate the answer for you.

On the first day, 5 cyclists came to spray both tires, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. Each tire costs $0.25, so that's 10 x $0.25 = $2.50.

Three cyclists came to spray all their tires, assuming each has 2 tires, that's 3 x 2 = 6 tires. Each tire costs $0.25, so that's 6 x $0.25 = $1.50.

One cyclist came with a one-wheel bicycle, so that's 1 tire. Each tire costs $0.25, so that's 1 x $0.25 = $0.25.

In total, Shaunda made $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.25 = $4.25.

153	Dave bought a large packet of fried potatoes and ate fourteen before a hungry Seagull bird stole the packet from his hands. When the seagull arrived, he smashed half the number of fried potatoes that Dave had eaten to the ground. And the three pigeons left the food behind, each pigeon eating three fried potatoes. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fried potatoes. The ants carried away the fried potatoes, leaving five behind. How many fried potatoes were in the bag that Dave bought?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Dave ate 14 fried potatoes.

The seagull stole the packet and smashed half of 14, which is 7, to the ground.

That leaves 14 - 7 = 7 fried potatoes.

The three pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fried potatoes.

But there were only 7 left, so they ate all 7.

Now, the raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fried potatoes. But there were none left, so the raccoon stole 0.

The ants carried away the remaining fried potatoes, leaving 5 behind.

So, before the ants came, there were 5 + 7 (that the pigeons ate) + 7 (that the seagull smashed) = 19 fried potatoes.

Now, Dave ate 14, so there were 19 + 14 = 33 fried potatoes in the bag initially.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Kwakukhona amapoteto afried ayi-33 ekhokhweni esabuyayo.""

(There were 33 fried potatoes in the packet that Dave bought.)"
154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three college students for 1 hour each day of instruction. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has two hours of instruction one day. In a semester, there are 16 weeks of school. In each semester, how many hours does Kimo spend studying in class?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundisa isiZulu (I'll answer in Zulu):

155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Billy were to put all of his pastries on top of each other, how many feet would it be?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 300 rolls, each 4 inches long = 300 x 4 = 1200 inches
* 120 chocolate croissants, each 6 inches long = 120 x 6 = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes, each 2 feet (24 inches) long = 60 x 24 = 1440 inches

Total inches = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, convert inches to feet: 3360 inches ÷ 12 = 280 feet

So, if Billy were to put all of his pastries on top of each other, it would be 280 feet tall!

Let me calculate the answer for you in isiZulu:

Amakhono (monkeys) aneemali yabantu (need) 200 amabhanana (bananas) + 100 amabhanana (bananas) = 300 amabhanana (bananas) ngonyaka (every) 2 imizuzu (months).

Igolide (gorillas) aneemali yabantu (need) 400 amabhanana (bananas) ngonyaka (every) 2 imizuzu (months).

Ukuthola ukuphatha (to keep them) ngonyaka (for) 2 imizuzu (months), kufanele (they need to) buba (buy) 300 + 400 = 700 amabhanana (bananas).

So, they need to buy 700 bananas to keep them for 2 months."

Kelly ran forward and backward once, that's 200 meters. Then, she ran 40 meters, 34 times = 40 x 34 = 1360 meters. Adding the initial 200 meters, Kelly ran a total of 200 + 1360 = 1560 meters

The winner is Kelly, and the difference between the winner's run and the loser's run is 1560 - 1500 = 60 meters.

161	Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Meanwhile, Locsin caught 5 smaller seahorses than Anakin, 3 smaller seahorses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish did they catch?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the fish:

Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 seahorses
3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
6 - 5 = 1 seahorse (smaller than Anakin's)
3 - 3 = 0 seahorse (smaller than Anakin's)
3 + 2 = 5 clownfish (more than Anakin's)

Total fish caught:
10 (starfish) + 6 (Anakin's seahorses) + 1 (Locsin's seahorse) + 3 (Anakin's clownfish) + 5 (Locsin's clownfish) = 25 fish

162	If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price will increase by 20% of its actual value every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?	92	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Initial price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

After another 2 months, the price will increase by 20% of $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

This pattern continues every 2 months. To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price after 18 ""2-month"" periods (since 36 ÷ 2 = 18).

Here's a rough estimate:

After 18 periods, the price will be approximately:
$20 × (1 + 0.20)^18 ≈ $83.22

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost approximately $83.22.

163	In the room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. A doll costs the same as 3 action figures and a red car costs $4. What is the total value of the toys, in the amount of action figures $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 doll = 3 action figures = 3 x $5 = $15
* 1 red car = $4
* Total value of dolls = 1 x $15 = $15
* Total value of red cars = 5 x $4 = $20
* Total value of action figures = 3 x $5 = $15
* Total value of all toys = $15 + $20 + $15 = $50

164	Jackie tries to make her own tax decision or hire an accountant. If she does her own tax, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, parting with $35 an hour in unpaid wages. The accountant costs $90. How much more will she have if she hires an accountant?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of doing her own tax: 3 hours x $35/hour = $105

If she hires an accountant, she'll pay $90. To find out how much more she'll have, subtract the accountant's cost from the cost of doing her own tax: $105 - $90 = $15

So, if she hires an accountant, she'll have $15 more.

165	On her 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many features as a gift. She has $1500 donated by her family and thinks she will save enough money to buy a dress. She goes to a computer store and chooses a €1090 machine with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also picks up scanners for €157, a CD burner for €74 and a printer for €102. How much will be left for her to buy clothes?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

Elvira has $1500, which is approximately €1275 (assuming an exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR). 

So, she will be left with:

€1275 - €1423 = -€148

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, she will be short €148 to buy the dress. 

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Uyaqedwa ngama-148 euros ukuthenga indwangu."" (She will be short 148 euros to buy the dress.)"
166	Sandra's neighbors give her nine baskets of eggs every time she babysits. To make Spanish flan, she needs three eggs. If Sandra is asked to make 15 Spanish flan for school money, how many times must Sandra babysit?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sandra needs 3 eggs to make 1 Spanish flan.
She needs to make 15 Spanish flan, so she'll need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs.

Her neighbors give her 9 baskets of eggs each time she babysits.
To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we'll divide the total eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs she gets each time (9):

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra must babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flan.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Sandra kufanele abasebenze 5 ukubonga ukuthola amaqiniso angenelelayo!"" (Sandra must babysit 5 times to get enough eggs!)"
167	Selth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, their combined age will be 28. How old is Seth?	16	"""Seth oyi abale ukwana Brooke. Mu mwaka ibili, omwana gwabwe gwali 28. Seth ali mwaka ng'ana?"" (What is Seth's age?)

Let's break it down in Luganda, a language spoken in Uganda:

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, S = 2B.

In 2 years, their combined age will be 28, so we can set up the equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Substituting S = 2B, we get: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's current age: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

So, ""Seth ali mwaka 16."" (Seth is 16 years old.)"

Let's break it down:

* Hat: $25
* Jacket: 3 x $25 = $75
* Trousers: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Total cost: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

171	Jake walks through an Entomology museum. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs did Jake see in all?	1210	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count those legs!

80 spiders with 8 legs each = 80 x 8 = 640 legs
90 insects with 6 legs each = 90 x 6 = 540 legs
Let's assume there's only 1 rare mutant invertebrate with 10 legs (since it's rare, right?) = 1 x 10 = 10 legs

Adding them all up: 640 + 540 + 10 = 1190 legs

Jake saw a total of 1190 legs! Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
172	There are 4 birds in Caboose. Sally the second is three years older than Grandma Red. Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally the fourth. If Sally the fourth is thirty-two years old, and Sally the twenty-second is eight years old, how many of the four birds are young?	51	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Sally the fourth is 32 years old.
Grandma Red is twice as old as Sally the fourth, so Grandma Red is 32 x 2 = 64 years old.
Sally the second is three years older than Grandma Red, so Sally the second is 64 + 3 = 67 years old.

Now, let's define ""young"" as less than 32 years old (Sally the fourth's age).

Sally the twenty-second is 8 years old, so she is young.
Sally the fourth is 32 years old, so she is not young.

We don't know the age of the remaining bird, but it doesn't matter. We already have two birds: Sally the twenty-second and possibly the unknown bird.

So, the answer is: **at least two** of the four birds are young.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezintathu kulezo nzima ezine"" (There are at least two young birds among these four birds)."
173	Jessica tries to figure out how much she pays monthly on each bill. The mortgage has a starting balance of $300 a month, her credit card has a balance of $200 a month, and a starting balance of $500 a month for buying and maintaining property. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this, how much does she pay per year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mortgage: $300/month
Credit card: $200/month
Property: $500/month
Total: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so:
$1000 x 1.5 = $1500/month

Per year, she pays: $1500 x 12 = $18,000

In isiZulu, that's: ""Izimali eziyishumi kanye nezinkulungwane eziyisithupha"" (Eighteen thousand rand)"
174	Billy peels the potatoes and grinds them in preparation for making a potato salad for his large family at a barbecue party. The big event, he has 60 potatoes to finish. The potatoes are the same size, it takes the same time to peel and grind each one. It takes Billy a minute and a half to peel, but it is 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take him to prepare the potatoes ?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Peeling takes 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds per potato
* Grinding takes 5 seconds per potato
* Total time per potato = 90 + 5 = 95 seconds
* Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare
* Total time to prepare all potatoes = 95 seconds/potato × 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60:
5700 seconds ÷ 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to prepare the potatoes.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice, each lemon they make for $3 of lemon and sugar and $2 of sugar. They sell one glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses from one jar. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemonade?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ilemoni elilodwa lifana ngama-$3 welemoni nesugar, futhi ama-$2 wesugar. Bafana ngalelemoni ngama-0.50 kuya ngama-20 ekilasini elilodwa.

Ukubonga ukuthi bafane i-$25, singathola ukuthi bafane kangakanani welemoni?

(To find out how much they spent on lemons, let's calculate the profit first.)

Iprofit = Iincome - Iexpense
Iincome = 20 glasses/jar * $0.50/glass = $10/jar
Let's say they made x jars.
Iincome = $10x

Iexpense = $3 (lemon + sugar) + $2 (sugar) = $5/jar
Iexpense = $5x

Iprofit = $10x - $5x = $5x
$5x = $25
x = 5 jars

Iexpense = $5x = $5 * 5 = $25

Kangakanani welemoni bafane? Bafane ama-$25 welemoni! (How much did they spend on lemons? They spent $25 on lemons!)"

Abanjezi abaseJapan bayisi-80. (The number of Japanese is 80.)
Okusho ukuthi abaseChina bayisi-240 - 80 = 160. (So the number of Chinese is 240 - 80 = 160.)
Abantwana abaseChina abayisi-60. (The number of boys in the Chinese team is 60.)
Okusho ukuthi abesifazane abaseChina bayisi-160 - 60 = 100. (So the number of girls in the Chinese team is 160 - 60 = 100.)

Kusho ukuthi kunezesifazane ezisi-100 kwiqembu leChina. (So there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.)"
177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his income on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and gives the other half wherever he wants. He gives his daughter $200 to spend on his church needs and $700 to his wife for household food. If Zaid receives $6000 a month, how much will he have left after these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Zaid spends 1/4 on rent, which is $6000 x 1/4 = $1500
He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is $6000 x 1/3 = $2000
He gives the other half, which is $6000 x 1/2 = $3000
He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, totaling $900

Total expenses and donations = $1500 + $2000 + $3000 + $900 = $6400

Zaid will have $6000 - $6400 = -$400 left. Oops, it looks like Zaid overspent! He'll need to adjust his budget.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

The sum of all three of their crabs together is:
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

181	Sandra, the florist in the corner, is upset because of Fred's incomplete delivery. Sandra has already bought four times as many red roses and white carnations. She also bought 200 pink calla lilies, five times the number of white carnations. Sandra threatens to change her shop if the scarce red roses are not delivered by 5 p.m. To keep the business with Sandra, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver by 5 p.m.?	160	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Sandra bought 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. She also bought 200 pink calla lilies, which is 5 times the number of white carnations. So, if we let x be the number of white carnations, then:

200 = 5x
x = 200/5
x = 40

So, Sandra bought 40 white carnations. Since she bought 4 times as many red roses, she bought:

4 × 40 = 160

red roses. But she already had some, so Fred needs to deliver:

160 - (number of red roses Sandra already had)

The problem doesn't mention the number of red roses Sandra already had, but since she's upset about the incomplete delivery, let's assume she had none. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver:

160

red roses by 5 p.m. to keep the business with Sandra.

Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan. So, two years ago, Mark was 30 - 2 = 28, and Jan was 28 - 5.5 = 22.5.

Now, Mark is 28 + 2 = 30, and Jan is 22.5 + 2 = 24.5.

Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is 30 + 2 = 32.

One of the two teams is well rounded and each member will run their 400-meter leg in 55 seconds. The other team is not well rounded; their first runner will run their 400-meter leg in 60 seconds and each next runner will be 3 seconds faster than the runner before them. Using this information, how many seconds will the fastest team win?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total time for each team:

Well-rounded team: 4 runners x 55 seconds each = 220 seconds

Not well-rounded team: 
1st runner: 60 seconds

3rd runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
4th runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds
Total time: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The well-rounded team will win by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

Let's break it down:

The merchant buys each sack for $20 and transports it for $2, so the total cost per sack is $22.

The merchant sells each sack for $30, so the profit per sack is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so to find the number of sacks, we divide the total profit by the profit per sack:

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Izinkukhu zidinga amapondo angu-3.5 ngewe ngalinye izinsuku ukuba zisebenze. Uma kunelinye lizwe lwamakhukhu angu-10, amapondo angaki angadinga ngosuku?""

Now, let's calculate: 3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day. Since there are 10 ducks, they need 0.5 pounds/day × 10 = 5 pounds/day.

So, the answer is: Amakhukhu angu-10 adinga amapondo angu-5 ngosuku. (The 10 ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day.)"
192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees do you have left?	91	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Year 1: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 50 + 10 - 2 = 58 trees.
Year 2: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 58 + 10 - 2 = 66 trees.
Year 3: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 66 + 10 - 2 = 74 trees.
Year 4: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 74 + 10 - 2 = 82 trees.
Year 5: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 82 + 10 - 2 = 90 trees.
Year 6: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 90 + 10 - 2 = 98 trees.
Year 7: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 98 + 10 - 2 = 106 trees.
Year 8: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 106 + 10 - 2 = 114 trees.
Year 9: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 114 + 10 - 2 = 122 trees.
Year 10: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 122 + 10 - 2 = 130 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees. So, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!) Tom has 91 trees left."
193	On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos outside Sue's yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted white flamingos back outside in front of Sue's yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. By noon on Sunday, the plastic flamingos were redder than the white plastic flamingos.	24	"Ewe o! (That's ""What's up?"" in Ewe, a language spoken in Ghana and Togo.)

Let's break this down:

* On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos.
* On Saturday, one-third of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos were taken, painted white, and put back. Now there are 18 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
* On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added. So, there are now 36 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

But wait, you said the plastic flamingos were redder than the white plastic flamingos by noon on Sunday. Hmm... I think there might be some confusion here. The story didn't mention anything about the flamingos turning red! Maybe there's a part of the story I'm missing?"

196	200 pounds of carrots will be distributed to 40 restaurants in one city. Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of carrots. How many kilograms of carrots will not be used?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's convert 200 pounds to kilograms: 200 pounds × 0.453592 (1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms) = 90.72 kilograms

Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms, so 40 restaurants will receive a total of 40 × 2 = 80 kilograms.

To find out how many kilograms will not be used, subtract the amount used from the total: 90.72 - 80 = 10.72 kilograms.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!

In isiZulu: ""Izinkgkilogram ezizayo zizoba 10.72."" (The remaining kilograms will be 10.72.)"
197	In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. They include 8417 men and 9092 women. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many children are there in Soda?	6277	"Kuliko! (That's ""Okay!"" in Swahili.)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total inhabitants = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Total adults = Number of men + Number of women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Number of children = Total inhabitants - Total adults = 23786 - 17509 = 6277

Kwa hiyo, kuna watoto 6277 katika mji wa Soda! (That's ""So, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda!"" in Swahili.)"
198	Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. A month later, she collected three times that amount. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards initially.
Month 2: She collected 3 times that amount, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards.
Total cards after Month 2: 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

Month 3: She collected 20 fewer cards than in Month 2, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
Total cards after Month 3: 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

Month 4: She collected twice the combined number of cards from Month 2 and Month 3. The combined total is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that amount is 100 x 2 = 200 cards.
Total cards after Month 4: 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards!

199	Mark is a copy editor. He schedules an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, each paying him a different price for each sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark schedules a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make per week, in cents?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark schedules 1000 sentences in total, divided equally between two publishers. So, each publisher gets 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 5 x 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 x 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents per week.

201	John wins a prize at work. The prize consists of a one-time cash award of $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he made $2000 a week, every week of the year and received a medal on the first day of the year how much would he have made that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John's initial weekly salary is $2000. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his initial annual salary is:

$2000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The 5% salary increase means he'll get an additional:

$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200/year

So, his new annual salary is:

$104,000/year + $5,200/year = $109,200/year

Adding the one-time cash award of $5000, John's total earnings for the year are:

$109,200/year + $5000 = $114,200

204	Janet had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 bags of green pencils and 2 bags of red pencils. There were 9 pencils in each blue bag and 6 pencils in each red bag. How many pencils does Janet have now?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count Janet's pencils:

Initially, she had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils, making a total of:
22 + 10 = 32 pencils

She bought 6 bags of green pencils, each with 9 pencils, so she got:
6 x 9 = 54 green pencils

She also bought 2 bags of red pencils, each with 6 pencils, so she got:
2 x 6 = 12 red pencils

Now, let's add all the pencils together:
32 (initial pencils) + 54 (new green pencils) + 12 (new red pencils) = 98 pencils

Janet now has 98 pencils!

Let's break it down:

* Each chocolate weighs 40g.
* Each candy apple weighs half of that, so 40g ÷ 2 = 20g.
* There are 25 chocolates, so the total weight of chocolates is 25 × 40g = 1000g.
* There are 80 candy apples, so the total weight of candy apples is 80 × 20g = 1600g.
* Add the weights together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600g.

210	Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the shoes each $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, gets paid $5 for each time she hides them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can buy a jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Let's do the math in isiZulu!

Sarah needs to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so that's $30 + (2 x $20) = $30 + $40 = $70.

She already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 for each time she watches the kids, and she does it 4 times, so that's 4 x $5 = $20.

She still needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $40 ÷ $4 = 10 times.

211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two chickens that are whiter than the red ones, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. 

Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Then, he has 2 white chickens. 

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so x red chickens will produce 3x eggs a day. 

The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so 2 white chickens will produce 2 × 5 = 10 eggs a day. 

In total, Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. So, we can set up the equation: 

3x + 10 = 42 

Subtract 10 from both sides: 

3x = 32 

Divide both sides by 3: 

x = 10.67 

But Jerry can't have a fraction of a chicken, so we round down to 10 red chickens. 

So, Jerry has 10 red chickens! 

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"

Now, let's calculate: The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(l + w) = 2(6 + 1.5) = 15 miles. If Gary walks 3 miles per hour, he'll spend 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours walking."
213	While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, he counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Kwame! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers for 2 days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers

To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total customers for the first 2 days from the total number of customers for all 3 days:

500 (total customers for 3 days) - 250 (total customers for 2 days) = 250 customers on the third day!

214	Jerry has two ponds, both leaking at 4 liters per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pond had twice as much water as the small pond. Now the big pond has four times as much water as the small pond. How much water does the small pond have now?	8	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!

Let's break it down:

Let the amount of water in the small pond 4 minutes ago be x liters.

Since the big pond had twice as much water as the small pond 4 minutes ago, the big pond had 2x liters.

Now, both ponds are leaking at 4 liters per minute, so in 4 minutes, the small pond would have lost 4 x 4 = 16 liters, leaving it with x - 16 liters.

The big pond would have lost 4 x 4 = 16 liters as well, leaving it with 2x - 16 liters.

But now, the big pond has four times as much water as the small pond, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Solving for x, we get:

x = 48

So, the small pond had 48 liters of water 4 minutes ago. Since it's leaking at 4 liters per minute, it would have lost 16 liters, leaving it with:

48 - 16 = 32 liters

Ngiyakuthanda (I love) math! The small pond has 32 liters of water now.

215	Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and the same $32.00 belt. Her salary is $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work before she can buy?	44	"Odi o! (Ahah!) In Yoruba, I'll respond.

To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, let's calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy: $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00.

Since her salary is $8.00 per hour, we'll divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and belt. Èyí ni! (That's it!)"
216	Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back with an additional 10% interest. If she were to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much would Janet's balance be at that time?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay 10% interest, which is $2,000 x 0.10 = $200. So, she owes $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, she'll pay a total of $165 x 12 = $1,980.

To find her balance, subtract the total paid from the total owed: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

So, Janet's balance would be $220 at that time.

218	Adrian is three times older than Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Calculate an average of three years over three years if Harriet is now 21 years old.	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Harriet is 21 years old.
Harriet is half as old as Zack, so Zack is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.
Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.

Now, let's calculate the average age:
(21 + 42 + 63) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 years old.

Adding 3 years to the average age:
42 + 3 = 45 years old.

219	Four students scored a total of 251 points in the board game. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 points more than half while Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo get?	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's score, which is 68 / 2 = 34. So Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total score is 251 points. We know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, which add up to:
68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find Jojo's score, subtract the total score of the other three from the total score:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

Jojo scored 54 points!

She used 90 liters, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

She collected twice as much rainwater as she had left, which is 2 x 30 = 60 liters.

Now, she adds the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

So, there are 90 liters of water in the tank now.

222	Andy plants 90 geraniums and a few petunias more than 40 geraniums. How many flowers does he plant in total?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Andy plants 90 geraniums and a few petunias more than 40 geraniums. That means he plants 40 + 90 = 130 geraniums. Then, he adds some petunias. Let's say the few petunias are ""amaphethelo"" (some). If amaphethelo is 40, then Andy plants 130 + 40 = 170 flowers in total.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
223	A company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year, and then spends a third of that money on advertising the next year.	20000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

A third of $15,000 is $5,000. So, the company spends $5,000 on advertising the next year.

In isiZulu, that's: ""Iqhamuka lesithathu sesikhombisa $15,000 yi-$5,000. Kepha, inkompani isayina $5,000 esikhombiseni sesikhathi esilandelayo."""
224	Carlos and Benji are on the beach. Carlos rents a boat for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the boat for 5 hours, how much will you pay for his rental, in total?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Carlos rents a boat for $30/hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he pays:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana boat for $18/hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Total cost = $90 + $90 = $180

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
225	Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. It takes 6 days by bus and half a day by car from New Jersey to Rochester. How many days would he travel if he planned to go to Rochester by bus and back to Rochester by car?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi Andrew uyaphi ukudlula ekutheni? (Let me calculate how many days Andrew will travel.)

Ukuya kuRochester ngomibuso kuya 6 amaduzu, futhi ukuya ngomoto ukuya 0.5 amaduzu. (It takes 6 days by bus to Rochester, and 0.5 days by car.)

Ukuya kuRochester ngomibuso kuya 6 amaduzu, futhi ukuya ngomoto ukuya 0.5 amaduzu. Ukudlula ekutheni kuya 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 amaduzu. (To travel to Rochester by bus and back to Rochester by car, it will take 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 days.)

Andrew uyaphi ukudlula ekutheni 6.5 amaduzu. (Andrew will travel for 6.5 days.)

226	James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what are the chances (summed up from the nearest river) that the randomly chosen card will be the type of water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the cards:

Initially, James had:
30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

He loses 8 water cards, so he has:
40 (water) - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 grass cards, so he now has:
20 (grass) + 14 = 34 grass cards

The total number of cards is:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The chances of randomly choosing a water card are:
32 (water) / 96 (total) = 1/3 or approximately 0.33 (from the nearest river)

So, the answer is 0.33!"
227	Chad orders a homemade burrito for lunch. The basic burrito is $6.50. He adds an extra meat for $2.00, an extra cheese for $1.00, avocados for $1.00 and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. He decides to enhance his meal to get an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use when he goes out. How much is he owed?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

Basic burrito = $6.50
Extra meat = $2.00
Extra cheese = $1.00
Avocados = $1.00
2 sauces = $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total cost of meal = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Enhance meal (chips and drink) = $3.00
Total amount due = $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so he needs to pay:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Kusheshela, Chad owes $9.00! (That's ""okay"" in Zulu!)"
228	Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda usually adds 4 pieces per minute. Her mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. How many hours will it take them to finish the puzzle?	1	"Ndi mzimu! (That's ""good question"" in Chichewa, a language spoken in Malawi!)

Let's break it down:

Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, and her mother adds half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it'll take to finish the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces they add per minute (6):

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it'll take them:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

to finish the puzzle! Mwabwino! (That's ""well done"" in Chichewa!)"
229	The gourd farm produced 120 gourd chicks. Ashlyn went to the farm two months later and found that 30 percent of the gourds were ready for harvesting, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the gourds were ready, so she harvested them. How many gourds were not ready for harvesting after two weeks?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 120 gourd chicks.

After 2 months, 30% were ready, so Ashlyn took:
30% of 120 = 0.3 x 120 = 36 gourds

Remaining gourds = 120 - 36 = 84 gourds

After 2 weeks, three-quarters (3/4) of the remaining gourds were ready, so Ashlyn took:
(3/4) x 84 = 63 gourds

Gourds not ready for harvesting after 2 weeks = 84 - 63 = 21 gourds

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
230	Mark buys 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars and another $1,000 to register them all. How much does he pay for everything?	276,000	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mark buys 12 cars for $20,000 each, so the total cost is:
12 x $20,000 = $240,000

He pays 10% tax, which is:
$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

He also pays $1,000 to register them all, so the total amount he pays is:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $1,000 = $265,000

231	Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday. How many shells did Kylie collect on Tuesday?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells, and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, so Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells.

So, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday!

Ngokuqhubeka ngokuqonda! (I hope that helps!)"
232	Dax went to the farms to pick the apples and found half the number of ants in the garden. If there are 50 ants, count the total number of insects in the garden.	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi uma kukhona amacala angu-50, kuthiwa uDax wahlangana nezigebengu ezinhlanu zemacala. Okunye okuthiwa, amacala ahlanu ku-50, kuyinto amacala angu-25. Ngakho, amacala nezihlangu zonke ziyahluka ku-50 + 25 = 75.

(Translation: I understand that if there are 50 ants, it means Dax found half the number of ants in the garden. That means half of 50 ants is 25 ants. So, all the ants and insects together are 50 + 25 = 75.)"
233	There are 36 pigeons at sunset on the ice. One third jumped in and swam into the sea. One third went into the cave to eat dinner. How many were left at sunset?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukubonga ukuthi (Let me think)... 

Ukuba kukhona amaphiko ayi-36 ekuseni (If there were 36 pigeons at sunset), kanti amaphiko ayi-12 ahambe emanzini (one third, which is 12, jumped into the sea), kanti amaphiko ayi-12 aya ekhaya ukudla (and one third, which is 12, went into the cave to eat).

Ngakho, amaphiko ayi-36 - 12 - 12 = amaphiko ayi-12 angaphandle (So, 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 pigeons were left).

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
234	Steve decided to eat more tomatoes first and decided to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 eggs a day. If a garden can produce 3 eggs a week, how many gardens should he have?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

USteve uyathakaza ukudla amathoma amancane, futhi waqala ukuzithanda izitoma ezincane. Uyadla kabili kakhulu kunokuthanda kwakhe umuntu wakhe. Uyadla amaqiniso ayisixhenxe ngosuku.

(Steve decided to eat more tomatoes first and decided to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 eggs a day.)

Igarden ingakhipha amaqiniso ayithathu ngoweek. 

(A garden can produce 3 eggs a week.)

Ukuthola ukuthi uSteve uyadla kabili kakhulu, kufanele aqhube igarden ezintathu ngoweek. 

(Since Steve eats twice as much, he needs three gardens per week.)

Ukuthola ukuthi uyadla amaqiniso ayisixhenxe ngosuku, kufanele aqhube igarden ezintathu ngosuku. 

(Since he eats 6 eggs a day, he needs three gardens per day.)

Kufanele aqhube igarden ezintathu ngosuku! 

(He needs three gardens per day!)

235	John buys pizzas to eat with his friends. There are 20 friends in all, and John wants to make sure that each friend gets 4 slices. The pizzas sell for 8 slices. How many pizzas does John have to buy?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi John akuthole iphayiza elingana na? (Let me calculate how many pizzas John needs to buy.)

UJohn ufuna ukuthi wonke umuntu aqaphe islice ezine (John wants each person to get 4 slices)
20 abantu x 4 islice = 80 islice (20 people x 4 slices = 80 slices)

Iphayiza liyaphakama islice ezinhlanu (A pizza has 8 slices)
80 islice ÷ 8 islice = 10 iphayiza (80 slices ÷ 8 slices = 10 pizzas)

UJohn akafuna ukuthola iphayiza ezilishumi (John needs to buy 10 pizzas)

Ngithola ukuthi! (That's the answer!)"
236	Ram uses a stack of pencils. He found that he could save money by combining five blank pencils to make one pen. If he were to buy 25 pencils and use them to make new pencils, how many pencils would he be able to have?	31	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: "" Uma uRam enza izipenseli eziyisithupha, uzoba nesipenseli esiyi-5. Uma uyabonga izipenseli eziyishumi nesihlanu, uzoba nesipenseli eziyi-5.

238	Mary is two years younger than Joan, and five years younger than Jessa. If Jessa is 20, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?	68	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down: Jessa is 20, and Mary is 5 years younger, so Mary is 20 - 5 = 15. Joan is 2 years older than Mary, so Joan is 15 + 2 = 17.

The sum of their ages is 20 + 15 + 17 = 52.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umnikelo weminyaka yabo yonke uyahluka ku-52."" (The sum of their ages is 52.)"
239	The number of pupils in the school ward was 1000. The ward had 3 entrances A, B and C for entrance and exit. If more than 30% of the pupils left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B, then the rest left through door C, count the number of pupils who left through door C.	280	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* More than 30% left through door A, so let's take 30% of 1000 = 300 pupils.
* 3/5 left through door B, which is 3/5 × 1000 = 600 pupils.
* The rest left through door C, so we subtract the number of pupils who left through doors A and B from the total: 1000 - 300 - 600 = 100 pupils.

So, 100 pupils left through door C.

240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?	21	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

John has 54 candies and has twice as many as Robert, so Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than James: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

242	Mike was friends with 5 people. He broke up with 2 of them. They sent each other letters 2 times a week that were 5 pages long. This was his response. He could write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours did he spend writing in a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mike has 5 - 2 = 3 friends left.
They exchange letters 2 times a week, so Mike writes 2 x 3 = 6 letters a week.
Each letter has 5 pages, so Mike writes 6 x 5 = 30 pages a week.
He writes a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 30 x 6 = 180 minutes writing a week.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours writing a week.

243	Jason has a cell phone schedule of 1000 minutes every month. He has 15 minutes a day to call his boss, and he has had 300 minutes a month to call other people. How many minutes did Jason have left if there are 30 days in the month?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Jason's remaining minutes:

Jason has 1000 minutes every month.
He uses 15 minutes a day to call his boss, so in 30 days, he uses:
15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes

He also uses 300 minutes to call other people.

Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's find out how many minutes Jason has left:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left.

244	Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took several more than Kyle did. Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries, and Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Griffin had 24 fries initially.
Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
Billy took several more than Kyle, so let's say Billy took x fries. Then, x > 5.
Ginger gave Griffin the same amount of fries as Kyle took, which is 5 fries.
Colby gave Griffin 3 times less than Kyle did, so Colby gave 5/3 = 1.67 fries (let's round it up to 2 fries, since we can't have a fraction of a fry).

Now, let's calculate the total number of fries Griffin has:
19 (initial fries) - x (Billy took) + 5 (Ginger gave) + 2 (Colby gave) = 27 (final fries)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
19 - x + 7 = 27
x = 9

So, Billy took 9 fries.

Now, let's find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin:
Ginger gave Griffin 5 fries.

In Zulu, we say ""Ngicela ukuthola ukudla!"" (I want to get food!), and in this case, Griffin got 5 delicious fries from Ginger!"
245	There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. There is a difference in the number of snails in these two aquariums and in the number of fish present in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi kukhona izinhlanzi ezine ezinhlanu ku-aquarium okubili. (I understand that there are five times as many snails in one aquarium as the other.)

Kunezinhlanzi ezili-4 ku-aquarium okunye, kunezinhlanzi ezili-32 ku-aquarium okunye. (There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in the other aquarium.)

Ukuthola ukuthi kukhona ukudlula okungafani ku-aquarium okubili, ngakho nezinhlanzi zonke zibe zingama-28. (To find the difference, I subtract 4 from 32, which gives me 28.)

Ngithola ukuthi kukhona amafishi asebenzisa inani elilinganayo ku-aquarium okubili. (I understand that there are the same number of fish in both aquariums.)

Ngakho, amafishi asebenzisa inani elilinganayo ku-aquarium okubili ayingama-28. (Therefore, the same number of fish in both aquariums is 28.)

246	The cost of the makeup artist's jeans is $250 per hour. She needs expensive makeup to make a movie isn't it and it takes six hours to do it a day and she needs to do it four times a week. The movie takes five weeks to finish. After the movie is over the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost per hour = $250
Hours per day = 6
Days per week = 4
Weeks = 5

Total hours = 6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost = 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

Discount = 10% of $30,000 = $3,000
Amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000.

249	On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue and her sister eat?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cakes. Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cakes.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cakes. Sue ate 2 times as many, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cakes.

Total cakes eaten by Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cakes
Total cakes eaten by Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cakes

Total calories eaten by Sue and her sister: (46 + 18) x 200 = 12800 calories
