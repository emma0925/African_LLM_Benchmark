Let's count the eggs: 16 eggs - 3 eggs (breakfast) = 13 eggs
13 eggs - 4 eggs (muffins) = 9 eggs left

She sells 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes:
9 eggs x $2 = $18

1	A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How many bolts in total does it take?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uma irobe liyafana namaboli amabili angomzimba wesibhakabhaka, futhi liyafana namaboli amahalfi angomzimba wesikhulu, ngoba amaboli amahalfi angomzimba wesikhulu ayi-1, ngakho irobe liyafana namaboli angu-2.5. (If a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, because half of 2 is 1, so a robe takes 2.5 bolts.)

Ukuthola ukuthi irobe liyafana namaboli angu-2.5. (So, a robe takes 2.5 bolts.)"
2	Josh decides to sell a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and invests $55,000 in repairs. This raises the price of the house by about 150%. How much profit will he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Josh buys a house for $80,000 and invests $55,000 in repairs, so his total investment is:
$80,000 + $55,000 = $135,000

The repairs raise the price of the house by 150%, which means the new price is:
$80,000 x 2.5 (150% increase) = $200,000

To find the profit, subtract the total investment from the new price:
$200,000 - $135,000 = $65,000

So, Josh will make a profit of $65,000.

UJAMES uyadlala imitha engu-60 ngalokho. Ngemini, uyadlala imarathoni ezintathu. Inani lemitha ayidla ngemini = 60 x 3 x 2 = 360

(JAMES runs 60 meters each time. On the weekend, he runs three marathons. The number of meters he runs on the weekend = 60 x 3 x 2 = 360)

Uyidla imitha engu-360 ngemini! (He runs 360 meters on the weekend!)"
4	Each day, Wendi feeds her chickens three cups of chicken food, along with a mixture of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, at three different meals; in the morning, she feeds her flock of 15 cups; in the afternoon, she feeds another flock of 25 cups; and at the last meal of the day, if Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, how many cups should she give them?	20	"Sawubona!

5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new house. One glass cost $5, but each second glass cost only 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1st glass = $5
2nd glass = $5 x 0.6 = $3
Since every 2nd glass costs $3, we can pair them up:
8 pairs of glasses = 8 x ($5 + $3) = 8 x $8 = $64
Remaining 2 glasses = 2 x $5 = $10
Total cost = $64 + $10 = $74

Kylar should pay $74 for 16 glasses.

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleson. Charleson has four times as many sheep as Seattle has. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleson, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleson has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleson has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleson, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Together, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

7	Carla downloads a two hundred GB file. It usually takes a minute to download two GB, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a reboot in order to introduce an update. which takes twenty minutes. Then Carla reboots to do the download. How long did it take to download the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so to download 200 GB, it would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through, the download is interrupted. 40% of 200 GB is:

200 GB × 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla has already downloaded 80 GB. To find out how long it took, we can calculate:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

After the reboot, which takes 20 minutes, Carla still needs to download:

200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

This will take:

120 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 60 minutes

Adding the time it took before the reboot, the total time is:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it took Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

8	John drives three hours at a 60mph convention and turns around because he realizes that he forgot to take an essential nap at home. He wants to get home in four hours but he spends the first two hours stuck in a queue of cars. He spends another half hour driving at a 30mph convention, before spending the remaining four hours at a 80mph convention. What is his rank at the end of those four hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

John drives 3 hours at 60mph, so he covers a distance of:
3 hours x 60mph = 180 miles

He turns around and gets stuck in a queue for 2 hours, so he doesn't move.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30mph, covering a distance of:
0.5 hours x 30mph = 15 miles

Now, he still needs to cover the remaining distance to get home, which is:
180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles

He spends the remaining 4 hours driving at 80mph, so he covers a distance of:
4 hours x 80mph = 320 miles

But wait, he only needs to cover 165 miles to get home! So, he'll arrive home in:
165 miles / 80mph = 2.06 hours

Since he wanted to get home in 4 hours, he'll arrive:
4 hours - 2.06 hours = 1.94 hours early!

So, his ""rank"" at the end of those 4 hours is... he's early!

9	Eliza was paid $10.00 for the first 40 hours of work each week and 1.2 times her hourly wage. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi Eliza wayenziwa $10.00 ngosuku lwamahora 40 ngeweek, futhi wayenziwa 1.2 times isikhathi sakhe. Uma Eliza enza 45 amahora ngosuku lwesi, angamniki kangakanani ngosuku lwesi?

(Translation: I understand that Eliza was paid $10.00 for 40 hours of work per week, and 1.2 times her hourly wage. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?)

Let's calculate:

Eliza's hourly wage = $10.00 ÷ 40 hours = $0.25 per hour

Overtime pay = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime pay rate = $0.25 per hour × 1.2 = $0.30 per hour
Overtime pay = 5 hours × $0.30 per hour = $1.50

Total earnings = 40 hours × $0.25 per hour + $1.50 = $10.00 + $1.50 = $11.50

Angimniki kangakanani ngosuku lwesi? Eliza angamniki $11.50 ngosuku lwesi! (How much did she earn this week? Eliza earned $11.50 this week!)"
10	New plans had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times higher than the number of downloads in the first month, but then it increased to about 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the plans have in total over the three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: 60 downloads
 Month 2: 3 times higher than Month 1, so 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
 Month 3: Increased by 30%, so 180 + (30% of 180) = 180 + 54 = 234 downloads

Total downloads over 3 months: 60 + 180 + 234 = 474 downloads

12	Carlos grows an orange tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year he grows seven oranges, with a rat for $1.5. Each year it costs $3 to water and feed the plants. How many years does it take for him to start making money from the orange tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Impendulo: (The answer is...)

Icala le-tree yorange ithenga amadola angu-90 ukuziphatha. (The orange tree costs $90 to plant.)

Ngenyanga, uCarlos uyakhula amazolo ayisikhombisa eseven, esithengwa ngamadola angu-1.5. (Each year, Carlos grows seven oranges, sold for $1.5 each.)

Ngenyanga, kuthenga amadola angu-3 ukuzisa nokudla izitshalo. (Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the plants.)

Ukuthola ukuthi uCarlos uyathola imali ku-tree yorange, singena ngenyanga?

(To find out how many years it takes for Carlos to start making money from the orange tree...)

Let's calculate:

Year 1: -90 (planting) + 7 x 1.5 (oranges) - 3 (watering and feeding) = -82.5
Year 2: -82.5 + 7 x 1.5 - 3 = -75
Year 3: -75 + 7 x 1.5 - 3 = -67.5
Year 4: -67.5 + 7 x 1.5 - 3 = -60
Year 5: -60 + 7 x 1.5 - 3 = -52.5
Year 6: -52.5 + 7 x 1.5 - 3 = -45

14	In a class of 20 music students, 20% enrolled in performing contemporary music, 25% enrolled in jazz, and the rest enrolled in electronic music. What percentage of students enrolled in electronic music?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in electronic music.

20% of 20 students = 4 students (performing contemporary music)
25% of 20 students = 5 students (jazz)

Total students enrolled in performing contemporary music and jazz = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Number of students enrolled in electronic music = 20 - 9 = 11 students

Percentage of students enrolled in electronic music = (11/20) x 100% = 55%

Kulungile! (That's correct!) 55% of the students enrolled in electronic music."
15	A merchant wants to make a trade choice between two business plans: Gold is $5,000 or electronics is $8,000. His financial advisor expects metal sales to rise 2.5% while electronics will rise 1.2% in the same month. If this merchant wants to make the most profit at the end of the month by making a trade choice, what would this value be?	125	"Elo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in Yoruba: ""Oriki ti a fe ki a to gbọdọ̀ru ẹni ti o ṣe pataki julọ ni ibi isẹ"" (The value we want to find is the one that will give us the highest profit).

Initial investment for Gold = $5,000
Expected increase = 2.5% = 0.025
Expected profit = $5,000 x 0.025 = $125
Total value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Initial investment for Electronics = $8,000
Expected increase = 1.2% = 0.012
Expected profit = $8,000 x 0.012 = $96
Total value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Comparing the total values, the merchant will make the most profit with Electronics, which is $8,096.

17	Jill is paid $20 per hour to teach classes and $30 to be a wellness coach. If she works 51 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, Jill earns $20/hour and works 35 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
$20/hour × 35 hours/week = $700/week

As a coach, Jill earns $30/hour and works 15 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a coach are:
$30/hour × 15 hours/week = $450/week

Her total weekly earnings are:
$700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since she works 51 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
$1150/week × 51 weeks/year = $58,650/year

19	Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles. She walks 4 miles an hour and then another 2 miles an hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to go the rest of the way?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Marissa walks a total distance of 12 miles. She walks 4 miles an hour for some time, let's call it x hours. So, she covers a distance of 4x miles.

Then, she walks 2 miles an hour for some time, let's call it y hours. So, she covers a distance of 2y miles.

We know that the total distance covered is 12 miles, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 2y = 12

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Let's call the speed she needs to go the rest of the way ""v"" miles per hour. Since she has already covered a distance of 4x + 2y miles, she needs to cover the remaining distance, which is:

12 - (4x + 2y) miles

The time taken to cover this remaining distance is:

(12 - (4x + 2y))/v hours

Marissa's total time taken is x + y + ((12 - (4x + 2y))/v) hours. Her average speed is the total distance divided by the total time taken, which is:

(12) / (x + y + ((12 - (4x + 2y))/v)) = 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

v = 4(x + y) / (3x + y - 3)

Now, we need to find the values of x and y. Since Marissa walks 4 miles an hour for some time, let's assume she walks for 2 hours (x = 2). Then, she covers a distance of 4(2) = 8 miles.

She still needs to cover 12 - 8 = 4 miles. She walks 2 miles an hour for some time, let's assume she walks for 2 hours (y = 2). Then, she covers a distance of 2(2) = 4 miles.

Now, we can find the value of v:

v = 4(2 + 2) / (3(2) + 2 - 3)
v = 4(4) / (6 + 2 - 3)
v = 16 / 5
v = 3.2 miles per hour

So, Marissa needs to go at a speed of approximately 3.2 miles per hour the rest of the way to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"
20	I have a gallon of orange juice of which two-thirds is water and I want to add a gallon of 15 gallons of orange juice of which three-fifths is water. But as I pour it, I lose a gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, you have 1 gallon of OJ with 2/3 water, which means you have 2/3 gallon of water.

The new OJ you're adding is 15 gallons with 3/5 water, which means it has 15 × 3/5 = 9 gallons of water.

You add the new OJ, but lose 1 gallon. So, you're left with 15 - 1 = 14 gallons of new OJ.

Total water now is 2/3 + 9 = 11 1/3 gallons.

You now have a total of 1 (initial) + 14 (new) = 15 gallons of OJ.

But the question asks for water in 24 gallons. So, you need to add 24 - 15 = 9 more gallons of OJ.

Let's assume this additional OJ has the same water composition as the initial one (2/3 water). Then, you'll add 2/3 × 9 = 6 gallons of water.

Total water now is 11 1/3 + 6 = 17 1/3 gallons.

21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is 31 now, how long ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 now, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. So, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we subtract 23 from his current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

24	Kyle bought the best-selling book for $19.50. This included a 25% discount on the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price.

Let the original price be x.

Discount = 25% of x = 0.25x

Price Kyle paid = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

0.75x = 19.50

x = 19.50 / 0.75

x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

30	If Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11, add them all together to 162, and subtract Allen's age from 10 years now.	109	"Jambo! Let me help you with that.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. We know that their ages add up to 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide by 18:

x = 9

So Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

Now, subtract Allen's age from 10 years:

10 - 99 = -89

31	Gunter tries to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80, another says 20, and a third says 25% more. What is their average guess?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Friend 1 says 80
Friend 2 says 20
Friend 3 says 25% more than one of the friends. Let's assume it's 80. 25% of 80 is 20, so Friend 3 says 80 + 20 = 100

Now, let's find the average:
(80 + 20 + 100) / 3 = 200 / 3 = 66.67

So, their average guess is 67.

33	Gretchen has 111 coins. There are 30 gold coins more than silver. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Gretchen has 111 coins in total. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 111, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 111

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 111

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 81

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40.5

But we can't have a fraction of a coin, so we'll round down to 40 silver coins. Then, the number of gold coins is:

40 + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"

In the first 20 minutes, Mike gets 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he gets 25% more points. To find 25% of 4, I'll multiply 4 by 0.25, which gives me 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike gets 4 + 1 = 5 points.

In total, Mike gets 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry eats two yogurts a day. They now sell four yogurts for $5. How much will he spend on yogurt and nuts for 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so for 30 days, he'll need:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since they sell 4 yogurts for $5, we can find the cost of 1 yogurt:
$5 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, let's calculate the total cost of yogurts for 30 days:
60 yogurts × $1.25 per yogurt = $75

But wait, the question asks about the cost of yogurt and nuts. Unfortunately, there's no information about the cost of nuts. Let's assume the cost of nuts is unknown, so we can only provide the cost of yogurts.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Terry uyabonga amayogurt ayi-$75 ekweni elilandelayo."" (Terry will spend $75 on yogurts next month.)

Please clarify the cost of nuts, and I'll be happy to help you with the total cost!"
37	John plans to sell his toys and use the money to buy a set of video games. He has 13 sets of Lego bricks that he sells for $15 each. Later, he buys eight sets of Lego bricks for $20 each and has $5 left. How many Lego bricks does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 sets of Lego bricks for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

Then, he buys 8 sets of Lego bricks for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He has $5 left, which means he had $195 - $160 = $35 initially.

Now, let's count the Lego bricks:
He had 13 sets initially and sold all of them. Then, he bought 8 new sets. So, he has:
8 sets of Lego bricks left.

In Zulu, we can say: ""UJohn unezinto ezinhlanu zeLego!"" (John has 8 sets of Lego!)"

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuphenduka kwakhe. (Let me help you with that calculation.)

Ukuthi uyaphinda izigili ezintathu zomzuzu, kufanele athathe izigili ezintathu ngomzuzu. (If he jumps three miles per hour, he will cover three miles in one hour.)

Ngemuva kwesikhathi esiyi-6, uyathatha izigili ezi-18. (In six hours, he will cover 18 miles.)

Kodwa, uma uyenza isikhathi esiyi-1/3 ukuthi uyaphinda, uyathatha izigili ezi-6. (But if he spends one-third of the time jumping, he will cover 6 miles.)

Uma uyenza isikhathi esiyi-2/3 ukuthi uyaphambuka, uyathatha izigili ezi-12. (And if he spends two-thirds of the time walking, he will cover 12 miles.)

Ngakho, uyathatha izigili ezi-18 eziyisixhenxe. (So, he will cover 18 miles in total.)

Suzy's iPhone is one year old, so Ben's iPhone is twice as old, which is 2 x 1 = 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 4 x 2 = 8 years old.

41	The giant dragon, Perg, sat atop Farbo's mountain, breathing fire on everything from a distance of a thousand feet. Polly was able to shoot a gold javelin, the only magic weapon that would kill the dragon, for a distance of four hundred feet, while the dragon's fire also reached well. But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she would hit the javelin three times as hard as when she didn't have the gemstone. If she used the gemstone, how fast would Polly stand upright and hit the javelin dragon?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukuthi uPolly uzokuthola ku-600 amafeet."" (That means: ""So Polly would hit at 600 feet."")

Here's the calculation: Without the gemstone, Polly's javelin reaches 400 feet. With the gemstone, she hits three times as hard, so 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. But the dragon's fire also reaches 1000 feet, so Polly needs to be at a distance of 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet closer. Therefore, Polly would stand upright and hit the dragon at 400 + 200 = 600 feet."
42	Uncle Jones cut five apple pies for the firemen's lunch. He cut each pie into eight pieces and placed five pies on the dining table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, when the guests had finished eating their own pies, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces did the guests eat?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Uncle Jones cut 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so that's 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.

After the guests ate, 14 pieces were left. To find out how many pieces the guests ate, we subtract 14 from 40: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests ate 26 pieces. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
43	According to nutritional information, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has five servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily caloric intake is 2,000 calories and you have already eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One serving has 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide 300g by 5:

300g ÷ 5 = 60g per serving

You've already eaten 1,800 calories, and your daily limit is 2,000 calories. That means you have 200 calories left:

2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories

Since one serving has 250 calories, you can't have a full serving. Let's see how many grams you can eat:

200 calories ÷ 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving:

0.8 servings × 60g per serving = 48g

So, you can eat 48g of chips. In isiZulu, that's ""Izinkwa eziyi-48!"" (48 grams of chips!)"
44	Charlie is trying to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax candles, he has a mouse to make ten beeswax candles. A pound of beeswax candles and its fibers cost $10.00 to get them. If he sells candles for $2.00 each, what is the profit if he sells 20 candles?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 pound of beeswax candles and fibers = $10.00
Number of candles made from 1 pound of beeswax = 10
Cost per candle = $10.00 ÷ 10 = $1.00 per candle
Selling price per candle = $2.00
Profit per candle = $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 per candle

If Charlie sells 20 candles, his total profit = 20 x $1.00 = $20.00

Umsebenzi wakhe! (His work is good!)

In isiZulu, we would say: ""Impumelelo yakhe iyaba ngama-20 dolara."" (His profit is 20 dollars.)"
45	Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and passes them on to her employers every day as part of her day-to-day work. A blogging job takes an average of four hours to research and write about. Last weekend, she posted five times more on Mondays and two-fifths more on Tuesdays than on Mondays. On Wednesdays, she posted twice as many posts as she did on Tuesdays. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing over the three days.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mondays: Meredith posts normally, so she writes 1 blog post, which takes 4 hours.

Tuesdays: She posts two-fifths more than Mondays, so (1 + 2/5) = 1.4 blog posts. Multiply by 4 hours each, that's 1.4 x 4 = 5.6 hours.

Wednesdays: She posts twice as many as Tuesdays, so 2 x 1.4 = 2.8 blog posts. Multiply by 4 hours each, that's 2.8 x 4 = 11.2 hours.

Add up the hours: 4 + 5.6 + 11.2 = 20.8 hours.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Meredith spent 20.8 hours writing over the three days."
46	Candice packed 80 Post-its into her bag before walking to work at a coffee shop. On her way, she stopped at the store to buy a packet of Post-its; at work, she put one Post-it on top of one of the 220 coffee cups waiting in line. If she had 23 Post-its left in all, how many Post-its were in the packet she bought?	163	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inhloso! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

Candice had 80 Post-its initially.
She put 1 Post-it on each of the 220 coffee cups, so she used 220 Post-its.
She had 23 Post-its left in all, which means she had 23 Post-its remaining from the initial 80 and the packet she bought.

Let x be the number of Post-its in the packet she bought. Then, the total number of Post-its she had is 80 + x.

Since she used 220 Post-its, we can set up the equation:
80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 163

So, the packet she bought had 163 Post-its!

Ngiyajabula ukuthola inhloso! (I'm happy to have solved the problem!)"

Let's break it down: Uriah's book bag weighs more than 1.5 pounds. Each comic book weighs between 1.5 pounds, so they all weigh 1.5 pounds. If he has 30 comic books, that's 30 x 1.5 = 45 pounds. Adding the book bag, it's more than 45 pounds. So, he'd have to carry all 30 comic books!"
53	A car repairman charges different fees to repair a flat tire on a car. A car repairman charges $60 for each flat tire he repairs, a car repairman charges $40. On Tuesday, a car repairman repairs six flat tires and four flat tires. On Friday, a car repairman repairs 12 flat tires but no flat tires. How much more money does a car repairman earn on a typical day of repair?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the earnings:

On Tuesday, a car repairman earns:
6 flat tires x $60 = $360
4 flat tires x $40 = $160
Total earnings on Tuesday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, a car repairman earns:
12 flat tires x $60 = $720
No flat tires, so $0 x $40 = $0
Total earnings on Friday = $720

The difference in earnings is:
$720 - $520 = $200

So, a car repairman earns $200 more on a typical day of repair.

57	A wooden bed and a rack of no more than five thousand pounds. A service cart full of identical boxes, each weighing fifteen pounds, will cross the bed. The total weight of the driver on the cart is at least three thousand seven hundred and fifty-five pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Izimpahla zesikhathi sezinto zonke: (Total weight of everything)

* Ibedi lakho: (Weight of the bed) ≤ 5000 pounds
* Umthunzi wesikhashana: (Weight of the service cart) ≥ 3755 pounds
* Amakhokhi: (Weight of each box) = 15 pounds

Izimpahla zesikhathi sezinto zonke = Ibedi lakho + Umthunzi wesikhashana + Amakhokhi

Since we want to find the maximum number of boxes, let's assume the weight of the bed is exactly 5000 pounds.

5000 = 3755 + (number of boxes × 15)

Subtract 3755 from both sides:

1245 = (number of boxes × 15)

Divide both sides by 15:

1245 ÷ 15 = number of boxes
83 = number of boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the cart without exceeding the weight limit of the bed is 83.

Original cost = $40.00
25% of $40.00 = $10.00 (added to the final cost)
Total cost = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

She has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up, but she needs to add another four gallons. According to her vehicle's manual, the tank holds 20 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophia travel with one tank of gasoline?	300	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuba Sophia usebenzisa igazi lesi-20, futhi wayenza imiles ezi-100 ngaphambi kokuba aqale ukubonga, kufanele aqale ukubonga ngamagali amane. Okwesikhashana, uqale ukubonga ngamagali angu-20, futhi wayenza imiles ezi-100 ngaphambi kokuba aqale ukubonga. Okunye okungenzeka ukuthi uqale ukubonga ngamagali angu-16, futhi wayenza imiles ezi-800.

(Translation: If Sophia uses this 20-gallon gas, and she traveled 100 miles before refueling, she must have refueled with 4 gallons. Therefore, if she refuels with 20 gallons, and she traveled 100 miles before refueling, it means she can travel 800 miles.)

So, Sophia can travel 800 miles with one tank of gasoline!"

66	There are four schools that compete in the basketball championship. Each school has sent a women's basketball team and a men's basketball team but each has five players. Each school has sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all the schools sent?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukubonga ukuthi (Let me calculate)...

4 schools x 2 teams per school = 8 teams
8 teams x 5 players per team = 40 players
8 teams x 1 coach per team = 8 coaches
Total people = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people

Kusho ukuthi (That's) 48 people!"
67	A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with 175 diamonds, 35 rubies smaller than diamonds, and twice as many pearls as rubies.	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the treasure together:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 35
* Pearls: 2 x 35 = 70

In total, the treasure chest has 175 + 35 + 70 = 280 precious stones!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for sharing the treasure with me!"
68	There is twice the ratio of males to females in Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 females and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If there are twice the ratio of males to females, that means the number of males is 2 times the number of females. Since there are 60 females, the number of males is 2 x 60 = 120.

So, the total number of students is 60 (females) + 120 (males) = 180.

If there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to get the number of teachers: 180 ÷ 5 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
69	Bailley started with some money. Then he received $5 a week for eight weeks. At the end of eight weeks, if he had a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uBailey wayenza kanjani? (Let me calculate how much Bailey started with.)

UBailey uqale ngemali engazi, futhi wathola i-$5 ngewezi ngewezi ngowezi. (Bailey started with unknown money and received $5 per week for 8 weeks.)

Ngokuqhubeka, waba nezimali eziyi-$100 emva kwewezi ngowezi. (At the end of 8 weeks, he had a total of $100.)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uBailey wayenza kanjani? (Let me calculate how much Bailey started with.)

U-$5 ngewezi ngowezi ngowezi = u-$5 x 8 = u-$40 (He received $5 per week for 8 weeks, which is $5 x 8 = $40)

U-$100 (total) - u-$40 (received) = u-$60 (He had $100 and received $40, so he started with $100 - $40 = $60)

Kusho ukuthi uBailey wayenza ngemali eziyi-$60. (It means Bailey started with $60.)

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"
70	Judy teaches five music classes, daily, on weekdays, and eight classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much does she make in a week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi Judy akhohlwa imali engu-$1,575.00 kuweek. (I calculate that Judy makes $1,575.00 per week.)

Ukubonga ukuthi: (Explanation is that)

* Judy teaches 5 classes/day × 5 days/week = 25 classes/week (weekdays)
* Plus 8 classes on Saturday = 25 + 8 = 33 classes/week
* Each class has 15 students, so 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students/week
* She charges $15.00 per student, so 495 students × $15.00/student = $1,575.00/week"
71	Kelian has two recipes, one with 20 ingredients and the other with twice as many ingredients. How many recipes will Kelian have to read in order to prepare both?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Kelian akaniso amarecipe amabili, okunye okulandelayo ukuba 20 amagatya, okunye okulandelayo ukuba amagatya amabini amanandi. Ukuba Kelian afuna ukubhala amarecipe amabili, uya kufunda amagatya angu-40. (Kelian has two recipes, one with 20 ingredients and the other with twice as many ingredients. If Kelian wants to prepare both recipes, he will have to read 40 ingredients.)

Ukuba Kelian afuna ukubhala amarecipe amabili, uya kufunda amarecipe amabili. (If Kelian wants to prepare both recipes, he will have to read two recipes.)"
72	Tommy raises money for his help by selling a piece of brown bread for $3 and a piece of cheesecake for $4. If Tommy sells a piece of brown bread for $43 and a piece of cheesecake for $23, how much money does Tommy get?	221	"Ekaabo! (Hello!)

Tommy sells a piece of brown bread for $3, and he sells 43 of them, so he gets 43 x $3 = $129.

Tommy sells a piece of cheesecake for $4, and he sells 23 of them, so he gets 23 x $4 = $92.

In total, Tommy gets $129 + $92 = $221.

Orire, Tommy ri $221! (That's it, Tommy has $221!)"
73	Sheila bought five phones for $150 each to pay the monthly rent for three months. There will be a 2% surcharge for each month. How much more will Sheila have to pay each month for three months?	255	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sheila bought 5 phones for $150 each, so she spent a total of:
5 x $150 = $750

She needs to pay the monthly rent for 3 months, so she'll pay:
$750 ÷ 3 = $250 per month

With a 2% surcharge, she'll pay an additional:
$250 x 0.02 = $5 per month

So, Sheila will have to pay $5 more each month for three months.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""USheila uzoba ngaphezu kwe-$5 ngomhla ngamahla amathathu."" (Sheila will pay an extra $5 each month for three months.)"
74	Artie has a flower pool at the Farmers Market. He sells three types of flowers: marigold, petunia, and begonia. The highest bid is $2.74 for a jar of marigold, $1.87 for a jar of petunia, and $2.12 for a jar of begonia. Artie has no money today, so he decides to match all prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 jar of marigold, 9 jar of petunia, and 17 jar of begonia, how much money will he get?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of money Artie will get:

Marigold: 12 jars x $3 (nearest dollar to $2.74) = $36
Petunia: 9 jars x $2 (nearest dollar to $1.87) = $18
Begonia: 17 jars x $2 (nearest dollar to $2.12) = $34

Total amount: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will get $88.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
75	Luke was spending time on the beach building sand houses. He eventually figured out that each sand house would have a floor that was half the square footage of the one below it. If it was a four-story sand house and the top floor had 16 squares, what was the average square footage of its one floor?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Top floor: 16 squares
Since each floor is half the square footage of the one below, we can work our way down:
Floor 2: 16 x 2 = 32 squares
Floor 3: 32 x 2 = 64 squares
Floor 4: 64 x 2 = 128 squares

Now, let's find the average square footage of one floor:
(16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60 squares

So, the average square footage of one floor is 60 squares.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
76	Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she will feed the puppy one cup of dog food a day for the first 800 days. Then she will start feeding the puppy two cups of dog food a day for the rest of her life. If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many dog food bags will Cecilia use for the first dish?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi... (Let me calculate...)

Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food a day for 800 days, so she'll need:
800 cups

Since 1 bag contains 110 cups, she'll need:
800 ÷ 110 = 7.27 (round up to 8, because you can't buy a fraction of a bag)

Kutheni, Cecilia uzokwanda amabhagi we-dog food ayi-8. (So, Cecilia will use 8 dog food bags.)

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"
77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David does, add up the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does four hundred pounds.	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so David does 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so Raymond does 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukubonga kubonga, uRaymond unesipho esingemva kuDavid ngamasipho angu-100!"" (Wow, Raymond has 100 pounds more than David!)"
78	Vincent has a mouse that buys three bouquets of flowers for $2.50 or two bouquets for $1. And how much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at a better price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

3 bouquets for $2.50 means 1 bouquet costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
2 bouquets for $1 means 1 bouquet costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, which is 6 bouquets (18 ÷ 3 = 6).

If he buys at the expensive price, he'll pay 6 x $0.83 = $5.00
If he buys at the cheaper price, he'll pay 6 x $0.50 = $3.00

So, he saves $5.00 - $3.00 = $2.00

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
79	John picked up a dog. He was taking the dog to the trainer, which cost him $100. The trainer gave him a 30% discount for being a new customer. How much did the training cost?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Itrainer ibiza ngamaphesenti angu-30 kusuka ku-$100, okuthola ukuthi iphi imali eyenziwe? (The trainer discounted 30% from $100, so how much was charged?)

Imali eyenziwe yi-trainer ingu-$70. (The trainer charged $70.)"
80	How many liters of water will be left over? Two girls will each have 1.6 gallons [24 L] of water, and one boy will have 6 gallons [6 L].	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of water:

2 girls x 24 L/girl = 48 L
1 boy x 6 L/boy = 6 L
Total water = 48 L + 6 L = 54 L

The question asks how many liters will be left over, but it doesn't mention the initial amount of water. Assuming the initial amount is more than 54 L, the answer would be the initial amount - 54 L. If you provide the initial amount, I can give you the exact answer!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"
81	Charlie had ten posters. He bought 21 posters from a department store and received 23 posters for his birthday. Then Charlie gave his sister the nine posters and decorated 28 with greeting cards. How many posters did Charlie have left?	17	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let me calculate that for you...

Charlie had 10 posters initially.
He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 posters.
He received 23 more for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 posters.
He gave 9 posters to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 posters.
He decorated 28 posters with greeting cards, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 posters left.

Kutheni, Charlie had 17 posters left! (That's ""so"" in isiZulu!)"
82	Grace weighs 125 pounds; Alex weighs two pounds four times as much as Grace does; how much do they both weigh?	623	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs two pounds four times as much as Grace, so:
2 + (4 x 125) = 2 + 500 = 502 pounds

Together, they weigh:
125 + 502 = 627 pounds

Sawubona! (Hello!) They both weigh 627 pounds."
83	Dan planted three rose bushes. Each rose bush had twenty-five roses. Each rose bush had eight thorns. How many thorns were there in total?	600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithi, ukuthola inani lezithorn ezitholakala, sizokwazi ukucophelela inani lezithorn zesithupha ngokuthi: 3 (izithupha) x 8 (izithorn) = 24.

Translation: I say, to find the total number of thorns, we can multiply the number of bushes by the number of thorns: 3 (bushes) x 8 (thorns) = 24."
84	A soccer team played 22 games, winning 8 more than they lost.	15	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Iqembu lebhola lihle lilambda amaligi angu-22, liphumelele ngamaphayona angu-8 kumaphayona ayilwe."" (The soccer team played 22 games, winning 8 more than they lost.)

Let me help you with the math: If they won 8 more than they lost, that means they won x games and lost x-8 games. Since they played 22 games in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x-8) = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, they won 15 games and lost 7 games."
85	Gene wears a quilt from old gifts. He has a quilt from every vacation he went on. Each quilt has its own quilt block. Each row of quilt blocks is made from different vacations he went on in a year. He goes on four vacations a year and has been on vacation since he was 23 years old. There are 34 quilt blocks. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?	44	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Gene ungowami oquilt ekhethekile kusuka kwemigomo eyadlala. Unequilt ekhethekile kusuka kwezinhlelo zonke ezazithenga khona. Inquilt block eyodwa ingekho kuquilt. Inquilt block eyodwa ingekho kurow eyodwa, eyirow eyiyo ingekho kwezinhlelo ezahlukene zonyaka. Ugene uthenga amavacation amane angu-4 ngonyaka, futhi usebenzisa amavacation kusukela ekuthatheni igolide lika-23.

Now, let's calculate:

Gene has been on vacation for 34 / 4 = 8.5 years. But since you can't go on a vacation for half a year, we'll round up to 9 years.

In 9 years, he went on 9 x 4 = 36 vacations.

So, he has 36 quilt blocks in total.

86	Greg set the bell to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the bell rang, it rang until Greg turned it off. The first time it rang today, it rang four times. The second time it rang, it rang three times faster than the first time. The third time, it rang half as fast as the second time. How many times did the bell ring in full?	22	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo yakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first time it rang, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it rang, it rang 3 times faster than the first time, so it rang 4 x 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time it rang, it rang half as fast as the second time, so it rang 12 ÷ 2 = 6 times.

Adding them up, the bell rang a total of 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

Ngiyabonga ukuthola ingxelo yakho! (Thank you for your question!)"
87	A company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing the annual salary of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed five years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after working for another three years?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Uma umsebenzi uyalima ngomnyaka wokuthola i-$600 ngomzuzu. Uma umsebenzi uyaphumelela iminyaka emi-5, iningi le-10% yokuthola kwesikhathi sokuthola. Uma uSylvie wahamba iminyaka emi-5 ekuqaleni kukaDisemba, iningi yomzuzu wakhe ngemva kokusebenza iminyaka emi-3?

(Translation: An employee earns $600 per month. If an employee completes 5 years, they get a 10% increase on their initial salary. If Sylvie completed 5 years last December, what is her annual salary after working for another 3 years?)

Initial annual salary = $600 x 12 = $7,200
10% increase = $7,200 x 0.1 = $720
New annual salary = $7,200 + $720 = $7,920
After 3 years, annual salary = $7,920 x 3 = $23,760

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 friends, but 4 didn't show up, so she has 16 - 4 = 12 guests.

She needs 0.75 gift bags for each guest, so she'll need 0.75 x 12 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be 9 x $2 = $18.

Kushasa, Christina! (Good luck, Christina!) Your party will cost $18."
90	Ted the T-Rex plans to bring a mouse salad to a dancing party. He knows that an adult mouse will eat a 10lbs mouse, and a baby will eat half a pound of the adult's food. If there are 20 adults and 5 kids at the party, how many mouse salad does Ted need to bring to the party to feed a mouse to each person?	225	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Amamouse ayisithupha (20 adults) will eat 10lbs each, so that's 20 x 10 = 200lbs of mouse salad.
* Amaqhezu amahlanu (5 kids) will eat half a pound each of the adult's food, so that's 5 x 0.5 = 2.5lbs of mouse salad.
* In total, Ted needs 200 + 2.5 = 202.5lbs of mouse salad.

93	Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast would Gerald run, with his acceleration, the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new time is 40 - (40 x 0.10) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds with his acceleration.

94	In a neighbourhood, the number of rabbits used as pets is twelve times less than the number of dogs and cats in the house. If there are two cats for every dog, and sixty dogs, how many pets are there in the neighbourhood?	348	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

There are 60 dogs, and 2 cats for every dog, so there are 60 x 2 = 120 cats.

The number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is 12 times less, so 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

In total, there are 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits = 348 pets in the neighbourhood.

95	Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls in girl scouts. How many girls are not in girl scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Two-fifths of 200 students are boys, so the number of boys is (2/5) × 200 = 80.
* Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.
* Two-thirds of the students are girls in Girl Scouts, so the number of girls in Girl Scouts is (2/3) × 200 = 133.33 (but we know there are only 120 girls, so let's use that).
* The number of girls in Girl Scouts is 120, so the number of girls not in Girl Scouts is 120 - 120 = 0.

He read 15 pages on Monday, so he had:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left

102	John likes to have a glass of water for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At the end of the day he drinks one before going to bed. John does this on weekdays, but on weekends, he prefers to have a soft drink for dinner instead. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks 4 glasses of water per day. That's 4 x 5 = 20 glasses.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) and 1 soft drink for dinner. So, that's 3 x 2 = 6 glasses of water.

In total, John drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water per week.

Let's break it down, my friend. If it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, that means it takes 10/3 minutes to cover 1 mile. Since the city is 42 miles across, it'll take (10/3) x 42 minutes to cover the entire city.

107	Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he watches an hour's episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesdays, he watches a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework on time and watches an hour-and-a-half episode. On Fridays, he has to be awake for the weekend, so he watches two one-hour episodes. If he spent seven hours watching TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesdays?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Frankie's TV time:

Mondays and Tuesdays: 2 hours
Thursdays: 1.5 hours
Fridays: 2 hours
Total hours: 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

Since Frankie spent 7 hours watching TV, the remaining 0.5 hours must be from Wednesdays. Since each episode on Wednesdays is 30 minutes, we can convert 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, Frankie watched 1 episode on Wednesdays.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Frankie wahlela eyodwa yeprojekthi eWednesdays."" (Frankie watched one episode on Wednesdays.)"
108	Henry, a baker for a wholesale baking contest, wanted to bake twice as much bread as he could have baked, and when he finished baking, he realized that he had used 15 more than he should have, and that he had taken out five loaves of bread as he was taking them out to cool, and now had 110 loaves of bread.	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let x be the number of loaves Henry could have baked.

Since he baked twice as much, he baked 2x loaves.

He used 15 more than he should have, so he used 2x + 15 loaves.

He took out 5 loaves, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 loaves.

We know he now has 110 loaves, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So Henry could have baked 50 loaves, but he baked twice as much, which is 2 × 50 = 100 loaves.

109	A local gas station sells gas for $3.00 per gallon. The app company offers a $0.20 refund if you go to this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will it be, after the refund?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost:

10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Refund: $30.00 - $0.20 x 10 = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the cost after the refund is $28.00.

110	Marcell and Beatrice compete to see who can eat the most roll-ups, so they bet on how many packs each of them has. Kosinadi makes a mistake, but Beatrice's is two roll-ups spread over 24 roll-ups and Marcell's is three roll-ups spread over 14 roll-ups. If they both ate all the money they bought, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

Beatrice's mistake is 2 roll-ups spread over 24 roll-ups, so she ate 24 + 2 = 26 roll-ups.

Marcell's mistake is 3 roll-ups spread over 14 roll-ups, so he ate 14 + 3 = 17 roll-ups.

Together, they ate 26 + 17 = 43 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 43 ÷ 2 = 21.5 roll-ups.

So, on average, they ate 21.5 roll-ups each.

114	Jamal's phone has six times more mice than Brittany's. Especially since Brittany's phone has 50 times more mice than the bird in Jamal's picture with the duck in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has 1,800 mice, how many mice do you have to see that Jamal's duck is in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's phone has 1,800 mice, and it has six times more mice than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone has:

1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 mice

Brittany's phone has 50 times more mice than the bird in Jamal's picture with the duck in the zoo. So, the bird has:

300 ÷ 50 = 6 mice

Now, the question asks how many mice you need to see to find Jamal's duck in the zoo. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about the duck having mice. It only talks about Jamal's phone and Brittany's phone having mice, and the bird in Jamal's picture having mice. There's no connection between the duck and the mice.

So, the answer is ""there's not enough information"" or ""it's not possible to determine"" how many mice you need to see to find Jamal's duck in the zoo.

115	Sasha found that the value of the lumba had gone up by 50% in the last few months after buying some lumba. Since she had some left over, she decided to sell them. She had 2 x 4 x 10 trees left that cost $10 each, and 4 x 4 x 10 trees she bought for $16 each. If she sold them all, how much profit would she make?	90	"Kwame, ndi ofuma! (Hello, my friend!)

Let's break it down:

Sasha had 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 trees left that cost $10 each, so the total value is 80 x $10 = $800.

She also had 4 x 4 x 10 = 160 trees she bought for $16 each, so the total value is 160 x $16 = $2560.

Since the value of lumba went up by 50%, the new price per tree is $10 x 1.5 = $15 and $16 x 1.5 = $24.

If she sold all the trees, she would make:

80 x $15 = $1200 from the first batch
160 x $24 = $3840 from the second batch

Total profit = $1200 + $3840 = $5040

So, Sasha would make a profit of $5040.

119	Adrien's total salary is 30 percent higher than Lylah's. After four years, her salary has increased, and she receives 40% more than she did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien received $40,000 four years ago, what is the total salary they both receive four years later?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Four years ago, Adrien received $40,000. Lylah's salary was 30% lower, so we calculate:

Lylah's salary 4 years ago = $40,000 - (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 - $12,000
= $28,000

Now, after 4 years, Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so:

Lylah's current salary = $28,000 + (40% of $28,000)
= $28,000 + $11,200
= $39,200

Adrien's salary also increased by the same percentage, so:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + (40% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

The total salary they both receive four years later is:

$39,200 + $56,000 = $95,200

Izinto ezithile: (Let's assume)

* Amalungu asebenza ngokucopheleleyo = 100 (overtime workers = 100)

Ukuthi uma-1/3 (one-third) wabaleka ngemuva kokuba bebalelwa yizingane, kuyinto uma-33.33% wabaleka. (One-third of the workers quit after being kicked by children, which is 33.33% quit.)

Ukuthi uma-10% wabaleka ngemuva kokuba bebalelwa yizingane. (Ten percent quit after being kicked by children.)

Izinto ezithile: (Let's calculate)

* Amalungu asebenza ngokucopheleleyo = 100
* 33.33% wabaleka = 33.33
* 10% wabaleka = 10
* Izimalungu ezisele = 100 - 33.33 - 10 = 56.67 ≈ 57

Kuthiwa izimalungu ezisele ukuthi zingama-57. (There are approximately 57 elves left.)

131	Joseph's expenditures in May were $500. In June, his expenditures were $60 less. What was the total of his expenditures in the two months?	940	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi (I understand that) Joseph's expenditures in May were $500. In June, his expenditures were $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.

Ukuthenga kwakhe kwamabili iminyaka (The total of his expenditures in the two months) is $500 + $440 = $940.

133	On Monday, Walt walked a mile. On Tuesday, he walked six times as many four miles as he did on Monday. His total from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 1 mile.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times 4 miles = 24 miles.
Total from Monday to Tuesday = 1 + 24 = 25 miles.

Since the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, Walt walked 41 - 25 = 16 miles on Wednesday.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

In isiZulu, the answer is: ""Walt uwakhwama amamayili ayishumi nesixhenxe eWednesdi."" (Walt walked 16 miles on Wednesday.)"

Let's break it down:

Brian had 20 video games initially, but lost 5, so he had 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has three times as many video games as Brian, so Bobby has 15 x 3 = 45 video games.

137	Rory suggested buying two soaps for $7.50 each, two bags of gum for $1.50 and two cookies for $1.00 each for the move. There was a 20% move fee added to the deposit if she wanted to make a $5.00 voluntary donation. How much would the move cost?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me calculate the total cost for you.

Two soaps for $7.50 each = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Two bags of gum for $1.50 each = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
Two cookies for $1.00 each = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Voluntary donation = $5.00
Total deposit = $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00

Move fee (20% of $25.00) = $25.00 x 0.20 = $5.00
Total move cost = $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00

Kulungile! (That's okay!) The total move cost would be $30.00."
138	Yesterday, Mark took a 75-question test, which he did with an average of five questions per hour, and today he took another 100-question test, which he did with an average of five questions per hour. If Mark had eight hours to complete the first and six hours to complete the second, how many questions did he have left unanswered?	105	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday, Mark took a 75-question test with an average of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete it, so he answered:

He had 75 - 40 = 35 questions left unanswered from yesterday.

Today, Mark took a 100-question test with an average of 5 questions per hour. He had 6 hours to complete it, so he answered:
5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions

He had 100 - 30 = 70 questions left unanswered from today.

In total, Mark had 35 + 70 = 105 questions left unanswered.

Let's calculate the total cost:

Food items: milk ($2) + eggs ($3) = $5
Non-food items: light bulb ($3) + glass ($3) + firecracker ($4) = $10

144	Kim had started a home security business and was calculating how much profit she would make from her clients. She already had three clients, but she was talking to five other clients and was so trusting that she included them in her conventions. Each client's house would require two bottles of blich and a laundry bag. The blich bottle would cost $2 and the laundry bag would cost $5 for one. This was her only budget. She calculated that her total weekly income would be $92. What is the difference between the profit made and the money spent, so how many dollars would Lucas make per week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 confirmed clients and 5 potential clients, so she's planning for 8 clients in total.

Each client needs 2 bottles of blich ($2 each) and 1 laundry bag ($5 each), so the total cost per client is:
2 x $2 = $4 (blich) + $5 (laundry bag) = $9 per client

For 8 clients, the total cost would be:
$9 per client x 8 clients = $72

Kim's total weekly income is $92, so her profit would be:
$92 (income) - $72 (cost) = $20

So, Kim would make $20 per week.

145	John has 10 hectares of cornfields. There are 100 cornfields per hectare. John will harvest his cornfields every 3 months. How many cornfields will John harvest in a year?	4000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 10 hectares, with 100 cornfields per hectare, so he has:
10 hectares x 100 cornfields/hectare = 1000 cornfields

He harvests every 3 months, so in a year (12 months), he'll harvest:
1000 cornfields x 4 (since 12 months ÷ 3 months = 4) = 4000 cornfields

So, John will harvest 4000 cornfields in a year!

Let's count the Lego bricks with Johnny!

The first Lego has 500 bricks.
The second Lego is three times the size of the original, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 bricks.
The third Lego has one-fourth the number of bricks of the original, so it has 500 ÷ 4 = 125 bricks.

In total, Johnny has 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego bricks!

147	Debra observed the number of bees coming and going in a day. She saw thirty bees leaving the zoo in the first six hours, and she saw that one-half and many bees returned in the next six hours. She saw twice as many bees as she had previously seen leaving the zoo flying out of the zoo and leaving in the next six hours. When any of the bees that had not returned returned returned to the zoo in the next six hours. How many animals did Debra see return to the zoo in the last six hours of the day?	75	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the zoo.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 (15) plus ""many"" bees returned. ""Many"" means an unknown number, so let's call it x. So, 15 + x bees returned.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as Debra saw leaving the zoo (30) flew out of the zoo. That's 2 × 30 = 60 bees.

In the last 6 hours, the remaining bees that hadn't returned came back. Let's find out how many bees were still outside:

Bees that left initially = 30
Bees that returned in the second 6 hours = 15 + x
Bees that flew out in the third 6 hours = 60
Total bees outside = 30 - (15 + x) + 60 = 75 - x

Now, all these bees returned in the last 6 hours. So, Debra saw 75 - x bees return.

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""Oriki Debra ti ri bee mẹ́rin lẹ́yìn ọdọọdun ni awọn ọjọ́ mẹ́rin tẹ́lẹ́."" (Debra saw 75 minus x bees return in the last six hours of the day.)

Let's break it down, my friend. The entrance fee for an adult is $12, and for a child, it's $10. So, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany's mother received $8 in change, that means she gave the collector $22 + $8 = $30.

Let's break it down:

* Charlie has 3 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends.
* James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 × 4 = 16 friends.

150	Steve lives three miles from school and has a bicycle speed of 440 beats per minute. Tim lives two miles from school. If Tim has a skateboard speed of 264 beats per minute, how long will the winner be at home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Elo! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in Yoruba, one of the many beautiful African languages:

""Steve ni ile mẹta miru lati ilé-ẹkọ, o si ni ipò oko agbẹrin 440 lẹẹkan pẹrẹminu. Tim ni ile mẹji miru lati ilé-ẹkọ, o si ni ipò skateboard 264 lẹẹkan pẹrẹminu. Ti a ba ri oluranlowo, olubadan yio si ri ile ṣaaju olufaragba paṣẹ.""

Now, let's calculate the time:

Steve's speed is 440 beats per minute. To convert this to miles per hour, we need to know that 1 beat per minute is approximately equal to 0.06 miles per hour. So, Steve's speed is:

440 beats/minute × 0.06 miles/hour/beat = 26.4 miles/hour

Since Steve lives 3 miles from school, it'll take him:

3 miles ÷ 26.4 miles/hour = 0.113 hours or approximately 7 minutes to get to school

Tim's speed is 264 beats per minute, which is:

264 beats/minute × 0.06 miles/hour/beat = 15.84 miles/hour

Since Tim lives 2 miles from school, it'll take him:

2 miles ÷ 15.84 miles/hour = 0.126 hours or approximately 7.6 minutes to get to school

The winner is Steve, and he'll be at home before Tim finishes the race by:

7.6 minutes - 7 minutes = 0.6 minutes or approximately 36 seconds

So, the winner will be at home before the loser finishes the race by 36 seconds.

153	Dave bought a large package of french fries and ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. When the seagull came down, he quickly ate half of Dave's french fries. Three pigeons snatched it and the food, each pigeon ate three french fries. Then, the pigeon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. The last ant took out the remaining french fries, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the package when Dave bought it?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so there were x - 14 fries left.
2. The seagull ate half, leaving x - 14 - (x - 14)/2 = x - 14 - x/2 + 7 = x/2 - 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, leaving x/2 - 7 - 3*3 = x/2 - 16 fries.
4. The pigeons stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving (x/2 - 16)/3 = x/6 - 16/3 fries.
5. The last ant took out the remaining fries, leaving 5 behind, so x/6 - 16/3 = 5.

Solving for x, we get:

x/6 - 16/3 = 5
x/6 = 5 + 16/3
x/6 = (15 + 16)/3
x/6 = 31/3
x = 6*31/3
x = 62

So, there were 62 french fries in the package when Dave bought it!

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo's college student had one-hour classes three times a day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had two-hour classes each day. In one semester, there were 16 weeks of schooling. In one semester, how many hours did Kimo spend in class?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 classes/day × 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 classes/day × 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day × 2 days/week = 8 hours/week
Total hours/week = 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week
In one semester, there were 16 weeks of schooling, so:
Total hours/semester = 17 hours/week × 16 weeks = 272 hours

Kimo spent 272 hours in class in one semester.

155	Bill makes 300 rolls, 200 croissant chocolates, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to put the nille products he made on each end, how long would they be in feet?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total length of each product:

* Rolls: 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 200 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 1200 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Total length in inches: 1200 + 1200 + 1440 = 3840 inches

 Convert total length to feet: 3840 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 320 feet

So, if Bill were to put all the products he made on each end, they would be 320 feet long.

156	A zookeeper who feeds a human in a zoo. He counts all the bananas from a nearby farm every two months. If a monkey needs 200 bananas, a rooster needs 400 bananas and a frog needs 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should he buy to have a mouse for two months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* Monkey needs 200 bananas/month, so for 2 months, it's 200 x 2 = 400 bananas
* Rooster needs 400 bananas/month, so for 2 months, it's 400 x 2 = 800 bananas
* Frog needs 100 bananas/month, so for 2 months, it's 100 x 2 = 200 bananas

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas

Now, to have a mouse, we need to add the bananas needed for the mouse. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't mention how many bananas a mouse needs. Let's assume it's x bananas/month. For 2 months, it's 2x bananas.

Total bananas needed = 1400 + 2x

The zookeeper should buy 1400 + 2x bananas.

Kelly runs the fastest once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much longer does the winner run than the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Blake runs the entire 100-yard field 15 times, so he covers a total distance of:
15 x 100 = 1500 yards

Kelly runs the entire 100-yard field once, then runs 40 yards and back (80 yards) 34 times, so she covers a total distance of:
100 + (34 x 80) = 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards

The winner is Kelly, and she ran 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards more than Blake.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""UKelly uyaphenduka ngamayadi amahlanu athulu kusukela kuBlake."" (Kelly ran 1320 yards more than Blake.)"

Let's break it down:

On Monday, the tank was 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it increased by 7 feet, so it was 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.
On Wednesday, it was 2/3 as deep as Tuesday, so we multiply 24 by 2/3:

So, on Wednesday, the water tank was 16 feet deep.

162	If a sack of marble drops $20 and the price rises 20% from the original price every two months, how much will the sack of marble fall after 36 months?	92	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down step by step in isiZulu:

Iphakamiso lesi: (The original price is) $20

I-20% yale mphumelo: (20% of the original price is) $4

Iphakamiso lesi elisha: (The new price after 2 months is) $20 + $4 = $24

I-20% yale mphumelo lesi elisha: (20% of the new price is) $4.80

Iphakamiso lesi elishiya: (The new price after 4 months is) $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

I-20% yale mphumelo lesi elishiya: (20% of the new price is) $5.76

Iphakamiso lesi elishumi: (The new price after 6 months is) $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

...and so on.

After 36 months, the price will be approximately $64.15.

Ukuthola ukuthi isakhi sesi siyaphuma ngaphezu kwe-$64.15! (You'll find that the sack of marble will cost more than $64.15!)

Ngakho, udoli luya ngamali $15, udoli luya ngamali $4, futhi amafegi athathu ayimali $15. Ukuthi konke kuyimali $34.

(Translation: Let me calculate... 

The doll costs as much as three figs, and the doll costs as much as a red car. The red car costs $4. Figs cost $5 each. So the doll costs as much as three figs, which means the doll costs $15. Therefore, the doll costs $15, the red car costs $4, and the three figs cost $15. So, all together it costs $34.)"
164	Jackie is trying to decide whether to file a tax return or rob a bank account. If she does the tax return, she will have to wait three hours less, and lose $35/hour in late payment. The accountant charges $90. How much more would she make if she robbed a bank account?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Ukuba Jackie efuna ukuthola imali ekhonteni, kufanele aqhube imali engu-$90. Ukuba efuna ukuthola imali ngokuvulela, kufanele athole imali engu-$35/hour ngokuvulela. Ukuba efuna ukuthola imali ngokuvulela, kufanele athole imali engu-3 hours kangaka.

Ukuba Jackie efuna ukuthola imali ekhonteni, kufanele athole imali engu-$90. Ukuba efuna ukuthola imali ngokuvulela, kufanele athole imali engu-$35/hour * 3 hours = $105. Ukuba Jackie efuna ukuthola imali ngokuvulela, kufanele athole imali engu-$105 + $90 = $195.

Ukuba Jackie efuna ukuthola imali ekhonteni, kufanele athole imali engu-$195. Ukuba efuna ukuthola imali ngokuvulela, kufanele athole imali engu-$0 (because she wouldn't make any money).

So, if Jackie robbed a bank account, she would make $195 more.

166	Sandra's neighbour gives her nine baskets of eggs for every time she takes her daughter. To make Spanish fries, she uses three eggs. If Sandra is assigned to make 15 Spanish fries for her school's business, how many times should Sandra take a baby?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukuba Sandra kufanele abeke kanjani?""

Let's break it down:

Sandra needs 3 eggs for 1 Spanish fry. For 15 Spanish fries, she'll need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs.

Her neighbour gives her 9 baskets of eggs each time she takes her daughter. Since we don't know how many eggs are in a basket, let's assume it's the same as the number of eggs needed for 1 Spanish fry, which is 3.

So, 9 baskets x 3 eggs/basket = 27 eggs per trip.

To get 45 eggs, Sandra will need to take her daughter 45 / 27 = 1.67 times. Since you can't take a baby a fraction of a time, Sandra should take her daughter 2 times."
167	Seth is twice Brooke's age, so in two years, they will be 28 years old.	16	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!) Let me help you with that.

Let Brooke's current age be x. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth's current age is 2x.

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. We know that their combined age in two years will be 28.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24

Divide by 3: x = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old, and Seth is 16 years old.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!"

170	Musicians line up to bid on new uniforms. One of the uniforms carries a cap that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times the price of a hat, and a coat that costs an average of the price of a cap and a jacket. How much do uniforms cost in total?	150	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The cap costs $25.
* The jacket costs three times the price of the hat, so it's 3 x $25 = $75.
* The coat costs an average of the price of a cap and a jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add them up: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

So, the total cost of the uniforms is $150.

172	There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is eight years old, what is the total age of the four birds?	51	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Let's add up their ages: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

Umsebenzi wam! (The work is done!) The total age of the four birds is 51 years.

173	Jessica's student loan has a $300/month minimum, her credit card has a $200/month minimum, and her mortgage has a $500/month minimum. If Jessica wants to pay more than the 50% minimum, how much does she pay in a year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total minimum payment per month:
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

To pay more than 50% of the minimum, Jessica needs to pay more than $1000 x 0.5 = $500 extra per month.

So, Jessica pays $1000 (minimum) + $500 (extra) = $1500 per month.

In a year, she pays $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

174	Billy is cutting and chopping onions for making salad for the family's homecoming celebration. It's a big celebration, so he has sixty onions to cut through. The onions are about the same size, so it takes one minute to cut and cut one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to cut one onion, but only five seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to prepare all the onions?	95	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo! (I love getting the answer!)

Let's break it down:

* It takes Billy 1 minute to cut one onion.
* It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to chop one onion.
* It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one onion.

To find the total time, we need to add the time it takes to cut, chop, and cut each onion.

* Cutting: 1 minute = 60 seconds
* Chopping: 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
* Cutting again: 5 seconds

Total time per onion = 60 + 90 + 5 = 155 seconds

Since Billy has 60 onions, the total time to prepare all the onions is:

155 seconds/onion × 60 onions = 9300 seconds

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

9300 seconds ÷ 60 = 155 minutes

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) It will take Billy 155 minutes to prepare all the onions."
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they make an average of $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar. They sell each cup for $0.50 and get twenty cups for each gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemonade?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Igallon eli = 3 (lemon) + 2 (sugar) = 5 (dollar)
Icup eli = 0.50 (dollar)
Igallon eli = 20 (icup)

Ukuthola iprofithi = 25 (dollar)
Ukuthola iprofithi = (igallon * 20 * 0.50) - (igallon * 5)

25 = 10 * igallon - 5 * igallon
25 = 5 * igallon
Igallon = 5

Igallon eli = 5 * 5 = 25 (dollar)

He gives his daughter $200 to cover his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for a budget for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
2. Gasoline: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
3. Total spent so far: $1500 + $2000 = $3500
4. Remaining salary: $6000 - $3500 = $2500
5. Donation: 1/2 of $2500 = $1250
6. Remaining after donation: $2500 - $1250 = $1250
7. Daughter's allowance: $200
8. Wife's budget: $700
9. Total given to family: $200 + $700 = $900
10. Remaining after family expenses: $1250 - $900 = $350

So, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

183	Two teams compete in the 400-meter relay, a race in which each team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one leg, around a flag. One of the two teams is the fastest and each member runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other is the least efficient; the first runner runs 460 meters after each runner must be four seconds faster than the next runner. Using this information, how many seconds do the fastest teams have to win the race?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Fastest team: Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

Least efficient team: The first runner runs 460 meters, and each subsequent runner is 4 seconds faster. Let's calculate the time for each runner:

Runner 1: 460 meters (no time given, but we can calculate it later)
Runner 2: 400 meters in 460 - 4 = 456 seconds
Runner 3: 400 meters in 456 - 4 = 452 seconds
Runner 4: 400 meters in 452 - 4 = 448 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time for the first runner:
460 meters / (400 meters / 55 seconds) = 460 / 0.727 = 633 seconds (approximately)

Add up the times for the least efficient team:
633 + 456 + 452 + 448 = 1989 seconds

To find the difference, subtract the fastest team's time from the least efficient team's time:
1989 - 220 = 1769 seconds

So, the fastest team has to win the race by approximately 1769 seconds.

186	Russell works in a pet store and divides the grass between the boundaries. The boundaries are set in three equal sections with each section being given six pieces of grass. There are ten hamster sections separated with each hamster receiving five pieces of grass. There is also a forest room where two pieces of grass are distributed between the rabbits. There is no grass for weeding elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of grass are divided into smaller sections, how many are in one section?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

* 3 sections with 6 pieces of grass each = 3 x 6 = 18 pieces
* 10 hamster sections with 5 pieces of grass each = 10 x 5 = 50 pieces
* 2 pieces of grass for the rabbits

Total number of pieces of grass = 18 + 50 + 2 = 70 pieces

Since 160 pieces of grass are divided into smaller sections, and 70 pieces are used, that means there are 160 - 70 = 90 pieces left.

Since there are no sections left for weeding, the remaining 90 pieces must be divided into equal sections. To find out how many pieces are in one section, we can divide 90 by the number of sections:

90 ÷ 160 = 0.5625

So, there are approximately 0.5625 pieces of grass in one section.

187	Mandy owed Benedict $100. They agreed to a monthly interest rate of 2%. If Mandy could pay it off in three months, how much would she give Benedict?	106	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the interest:

Month 1: $100 x 2% = $2
Total: $100 + $2 = $102

Month 2: $102 x 2% = $2.04
Total: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Month 3: $104.04 x 2% = $2.0808
Total: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1216

So, Mandy would give Benedict $106.12.

188	If it cost $2 to transport a sack of wheat from the farm to the warehouse, but the merchant made $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Let's break it down:

The merchant made $400 after selling all the sacks. That means the total revenue is $400 + (cost of transporting all sacks).

The cost of transporting one sack is $2, so the cost of transporting all sacks is 2x, where x is the number of sacks.

The merchant sold each sack for $30, so the total revenue is 30x.

We can set up the equation: 30x - 2x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28x = 400

Dividing both sides by 28, we get: x = 14.29 (but we can't sell a fraction of a sack, so we round down to 14)

So, the merchant sold 14 sacks of wheat!

189	Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets for the show. They spent $4.50 more on food than on tickets. They also went on two separate rides that cost $33 each. If they decided to divide the total cost equally, how much did each person pay?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the costs:

* 3 tickets = $20.25
* Food = $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75
* 2 rides = 2 x $33 = $66
* Total cost = $20.25 + $24.75 + $66 = $111

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$111 ÷ 3 = $37

So each person paid $37.

192	Tom plants ten trees in a row. Each row he cuts down two trees per row. He started with fifty trees. After ten years 30% of the trees died. How many trees did he have left?	91	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Tom starts with 50 trees.
He plants 10 trees in a row, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees.
He cuts down 2 trees per row, so he cuts down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.
Now he has 60 - 20 = 40 trees left.
After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 40, multiply 40 by 0.3: 40 x 0.3 = 12 trees die.
So, Tom has 40 - 12 = 28 trees left.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned a third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted flamingos back in front of Sue's house. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. On Sunday afternoon, how many more pink plastic flamingos were taken out than white plastic flamingos?	24	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Hello, hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Friday, 18 pink flamingos were placed.

On Saturday, a third of 18 (6) were returned, painted white, and put back. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday morning, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday afternoon, the question asks how many more pink flamingos were taken out than white flamingos. However, there's no mention of any flamingos being taken out. So, the answer is 0. There were no pink flamingos taken out.

In Twi, I'd say: ""Ɛno na ɛyɛ sɛ wɔde pink flamingo biara so, na ɛyɛ sɛ wɔde white flamingo biara so. Enti ɛyɛ zero!"" (It's not like they took out any pink flamingos, and it's not like they took out any white flamingos. So, it's zero!)"
194	Violetta wants to buy a new oatmeal. She wants them in different colors and has spent $20 to buy this one. One oatmeal costs $2. How much money will she get?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uma Violetta uyakhokha $20, futhi inani elilodwa le-oatmeal li-$2, ngoba ngithola ukuthi uyofuna ama-oatmeal ahlukahlukene ngokubonga. (I want to find out that if Violetta pays $20, and each oatmeal costs $2, because I think she wants oatmeals of different colors.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi uyothola ama-oatmeal angu-10, ngoba $20 kuyahluka ku-$2 ngokuthola ku-10. (I think she will get 10 oatmeals, because $20 divided by $2 gives 10.)

Ngoba uyakhokha $20, futhi uyothola ama-oatmeal angu-10, ngicabanga ukuthi uyofuna imali engu-$0. (Because she pays $20, and she gets 10 oatmeals, I think she will have $0 left.)

Uyofuna imali engu-$0. (She will have $0 left.)

195	A pencil costs more than a pencil and a eraser combined. A free pencil costs $1.20 and a eraser $0.30. How much would eight pencils cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down, my friend. A free pencil costs $1.20, but a pencil actually costs less than a pencil and an eraser combined. So, the cost of a pencil is $1.20 - $0.30 = $0.90.

Now, if we want to find out how much eight pencils would cost, we multiply the cost of one pencil by 8: $0.90 × 8 = $7.20.

Kulungile, my friend! (That's correct!) Eight pencils would cost $7.20."

197	In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. They include 8417 men and 9092 women. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many children are there in Soda?	6277	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total inhabitants = 23786
Men = 8417
Women = 9092

Total adults = Men + Women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Number of children = Total inhabitants - Total adults = 23786 - 17509 = 6277

Kutheni, kusasa kuba ngani abantwana 6277 eSoda! (So, there are 6277 children in Soda!)"
198	Elaine started out with 20 Pokemon cards. A month later, she received three times that number. The second month, she received 20 fewer than the first month. The third month, she received twice as many Pokemon cards as the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.
 Month 2: She received 3 times 20 = 60 Pokémon cards.
 Month 3: She received 60 - 20 = 40 Pokémon cards.
 Month 4: She received 2 times (60 + 40) = 200 Pokémon cards.

In total, Elaine has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 Pokémon cards.

199	Mark is an editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, each paying him a different price per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as publisher A. Mark edits a total of one thousand sentences each week and is paid five cents per sentence by publisher A. How much does Mark earn per week, and cents?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mark ukhamba amaqhinga amahlanu ashu (Mark edits 1000 sentences per week).

Uqhamuka amaqhinga amahlanu ashu ku-Publisher A, futhi uqhamuka amaqhinga amahlanu ashu ku-Publisher B (He edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B).

Publisher A iphakamisa i-cents eziyisihlanu (Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence).

Publisher B iphakamisa amaphakathi athathu ku-cents eziyisihlanu (Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so 10 cents per sentence).

Izindleko zikaMark ku-Publisher A yi-500 x 5 = 2500 cents (Mark earns 2500 cents from Publisher A).

Izindleko zikaMark ku-Publisher B yi-500 x 10 = 5000 cents (Mark earns 5000 cents from Publisher B).

Izindleko zikaMark ngokuhamba yi-2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents (Mark earns a total of 7500 cents per week).

201	John receives a bonus at work. This bonus consists of a one-time payment of $5000 plus a 5% increase in salary. If he receives 2000 a week, every week of the year and he receives a bonus on the first day of the year how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John's weekly salary is $2000. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

$2000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The 5% increase in salary means he'll earn an additional:

$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200/year

So, his new annual salary is:

$104,000/year + $5,200/year = $109,200/year

Adding the one-time payment of $5000, his total earnings for the year are:

$109,200/year + $5000 = $114,200

203	Carl's favorite food is cheese. He ate one sandwich every day this week for lunch taking two pieces of cheese for each sandwich. He ate cheese and omelet for breakfast three days a week with one more piece for each omelet than a sandwich. He cooked a large meal of macaroni and cheese to steal his dinner for the week and used 8 pieces of cheese in it. How many pieces of cheese did he use?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* He ate 1 sandwich/day for 7 days, with 2 pieces of cheese each, so that's 1 x 7 x 2 = 14 pieces.
* He ate omelet 3 days a week, with 2 + 1 = 3 pieces of cheese each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 pieces.
* He used 8 pieces of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dinner.

Adding all together, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 pieces of cheese.

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's evening class. Mr. Bert gives six exams in each semester. He allows students to remove the maximum and average marks in each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five exams, what score would he need in the sixth exam to get an average of 93?	98	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total score Brinley needs to get an average of 93:

Total score needed = Number of exams x Desired average
= 6 x 93
= 558

Now, let's calculate the total score Brinley already has:

Total score so far = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
= 438

To find the score Brinley needs in the sixth exam, subtract the total score so far from the total score needed:

Score needed in sixth exam = Total score needed - Total score so far
= 558 - 438
= 120

However, since Mr. Bert allows students to remove the maximum and average marks, we need to consider the maximum score Brinley can remove. In this case, it's 100. If Brinley removes the maximum score, his new total score so far would be:

New total score so far = Total score so far - Maximum score removed
= 438 - 100
= 338

Now, let's recalculate the score Brinley needs in the sixth exam:

Score needed in sixth exam = Total score needed - New total score so far
= 558 - 338
= 220

So, Brinley would need to score at least 220 in the sixth exam to get an average of 93. Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"
206	Michael loved cycling. He gave it a try five times a week and rode 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, then decided to ride the bike only twice a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and did that for three weeks. How many kilometers did Michael ride in total?	860	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Weeks 1-4: 5 times a week, 25 km each = 5 x 25 = 125 km/week. For 4 weeks, that's 125 x 4 = 500 km.

Weeks 5-7: 2 times a week, 60 km each = 2 x 60 = 120 km/week. For 3 weeks, that's 120 x 3 = 360 km.

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 km.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Michael rode 860 kilometers in total."
207	The Halloween Joe bag contains 25 chocolates and 80 apples. Each chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple. If each chocolate weighs 40g, how many bags of Joe's are there, in grams?	2600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Each chocolate weighs 40g, and each chocolate weighs twice as much as each apple. So, each apple weighs 40g ÷ 2 = 20g.

In one bag, there are 25 chocolates and 80 apples. The total weight of chocolates is 25 x 40g = 1000g. The total weight of apples is 80 x 20g = 1600g. The total weight of one bag is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, the answer is: 2600g.

208	Rose went to the store on Monday and bought four cakes. On Tuesday she went to different stores and bought three times the number of cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought five times the number of cakes she had bought on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?	76	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, so 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, so 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

210	Sara is about to buy herself a jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket she wants is $30 and the shoes are $20. Sara takes care of her neighbor's kids four times and gets $5 for each time she does. Her grandmother pays her $4 for every time she cleans the house. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts taking care of the children, how many times will she have to clean the house before she can afford to buy the jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Let's calculate how much Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes. The jacket is $30 and the shoes are $20, so she needs $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10, so she needs $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 for each time she takes care of the kids, and she does it 4 times, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20.

She still needs $40 - $20 = $20 more.

Her grandmother pays her $4 for every time she cleans the house. To find out how many times she needs to clean the house, we divide $20 by $4. $20 ÷ $4 = 5.

So, Sara needs to clean the house 5 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Sara kufanele akhulule indlu ngokwezi 5 ukuba angene ngijacket ne-shoes."" (Sara needs to clean the house 5 times to buy the jacket and shoes.)"
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red hen lays three eggs a day and the white hen lays five eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

I-red hen ilayisa amaqiniso angu-3 ngosuku (The red hen lays 3 eggs a day)
I-white hen ilayisa amaqiniso angu-5 ngosuku (The white hen lays 5 eggs a day)
UJerry uyabonga amaqiniso angu-42 ngosuku (Jerry collects 42 eggs a day)
I-white hen ingaphezulu kwaba-red hen ngamathathu (He has 2 more white chickens than red chickens)

Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Then, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs laid per day is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

So, UJerry una-red hen angu-4 (Jerry has 4 red chickens)."
212	Gary enjoys walking around the neighborhood park, a one-and-a-half-square-mile stretch along the main road. If he walks three miles per hour, how many hours does it take him to walk?	5	"Ndi Igbo, o di mma! (That's good in Igbo!)

Let's break it down:

The park is 1.5 square miles, but we need to find the perimeter, which is the distance around the park. Since it's a rectangular shape along the main road, we can assume it's roughly a rectangle. Let's estimate the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since it's 1.5 square miles, let's assume the length and width are roughly equal. Let's take the square root of 1.5, which is approximately 1.22 miles. So, the length and width are roughly 1.22 miles each.

Perimeter ≈ 2(1.22 + 1.22) = 2 x 2.44 = 4.88 miles

Now, Gary walks at 3 miles per hour, so to find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 4.88 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 1.63 hours

O di mma, Gary! (That's good, Gary!) It'll take him approximately 1 hour and 38 minutes to walk around the neighborhood park."
213	At the dollar store, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store, and the next day he counted 50 more than the previous day. If the total on the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (That's ""okay"" in Akan, a language spoken in Ghana!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total for 2 days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers
Total for 3 days: 500 customers
To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total for 2 days from the total for 3 days:
500 - 250 = 250 customers

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day!

214	Jerry has two ponds, both with openings that discharge about four gallons of water per minute. Four minutes would have gone by, the larger pond has twice the water capacity of the smaller pond. Now the larger pond has four times the water capacity of the smaller pond. How much water is in the smaller pond?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

215	Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and $32.00 matching straps. Her overtime job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work before she can afford to buy something?	44	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how many hours Lori needs to work:

Total cost of shoes and straps = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Hourly wage = $8.00

To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Lori needs to work 44 hours to afford the shoes and straps.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uyafuna ukusebenza imihla engama-44 ukuze aqhubele izicathamo nezihlalo."" (She needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and straps.)"
216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back at 10% interest. If she had to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much would Janeth have to pay for that time?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""UJaneth uyabonga i-$2,000, futhi wayeseka ukuthola inzalo yayo ngokushesha kwe-10%. Uma wayenza ukulipha i-$165 ngomzuzu ngonyaka, inani leyodwa uJaneth ayofika ukulipha ngaleso sikhathi?""

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth would pay:

Janeth borrowed $2,000 at 10% interest. To find the interest, multiply the principal by the interest rate: $2,000 x 0.10 = $200.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is the principal plus interest: $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

Since she pays $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she'll pay is: $165 x 12 = $1,980.

However, this amount is less than the total amount she needs to pay ($2,200). This means she'll still owe $2,200 - $1,980 = $220 after the 12 months.

So, uJaneth uyofika ukulipha i-$2,200 ngaleso sikhathi. (Janeth will pay a total of $2,200 during that time.)"

218	Adrian is three times older than Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. What is the average age of the three over three years if Harriet is now 21 years old?	45	"Elo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Harriet is 21 years old.

Since Harriet is half as old as Zack, Zack's age is 21 x 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 x 3 = 63 years old.

Now, let's find the average age:

(21 + 42 + 63) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 years old.

So, the average age of the three over three years is 42 years old.

Sawa! (Good!)"
219	Four students scored a total of 251 points in the board game; Naomi scored 68; Yuri scored 10 more than half, and Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Naomi waneka amaphoyinti angu-68. (Naomi scored 68 points.)
Yuri waneka amaphoyinti angu-10 ngaphezulu kwezihlanu zika-Naomi. (Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points.)
Naomi no-Brianna babeneka amaphoyinti angu-17 ngaphezulu kuka-Naomi. (Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.)

Let's calculate:

Yuri's points = (Naomi's points / 2) + 10 = (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
Naomi and Brianna's points = Naomi's points + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
Brianna's points = Naomi and Brianna's points - Naomi's points = 85 - 68 = 17

So, Brianna scored 17 points.

Total points = Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points = 68 + 44 + 17 = 129 points.

But wait, the question says the total points are 251. That means we need to find the remaining points:

Remaining points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points) = 251 - 129 = 122

These remaining points belong to the fourth student."

226	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 cards of light, 20 of green, and 40 of water. If he throws away 8 of green and buys 14 of green, what is the percentage chance (corrected to the nearest number) that the randomly selected card will be water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has:
30 (light) + 20 (green) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

He throws away 8 green cards, so he has:
20 (green) - 8 = 12 green cards left

Then, he buys 14 more green cards, so he now has:
12 (green) + 14 = 26 green cards

The new total number of cards is:
30 (light) + 26 (green) + 40 (water) = 96 cards

The number of water cards remains the same, which is 40.
To find the percentage chance of randomly selecting a water card, divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:
(40 ÷ 96) × 100 ≈ 41.67%

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage chance of randomly selecting a water card is 42%.

227	Chad sells a homemade burrito for lunch. The basic burrito is $6.50. He adds meat for $2.00, another cheese for $1.00, coconut for $1.00, and two sausages for $0.25 each. He decides to promote his food for an additional $3.00 which will add chips and a glass of wine. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses at the checkout. How much is he still owed?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Basic burrito = $6.50
Meat = $2.00
Another cheese = $1.00
Coconut = $1.00
Two sausages = $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total so far = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Promotion (chips and wine) = $3.00
Total cost = $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00
Gift card = $5.00
Amount owed = $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Uyabonga! (You're welcome!) Chad still owes $9.00."
228	Calendar and its mother work on 360 puzzles; Calendar has a mouse that adds four puzzles per minute; Mother has a mouse that adds half as many puzzles per minute; How long will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inketho. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Calendar's mouse adds 4 puzzles per minute, and Mother's mouse adds half of that, which is 2 puzzles per minute. Together, they add 4 + 2 = 6 puzzles per minute.

To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360 puzzles, we can divide 360 by 6:

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

So, it will take them 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

229	One watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn visited the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she planted them. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After 2 months, 30% were ready for harvest, so Ashlyn harvested:
120 x 0.3 = 36 watermelons

Remaining watermelons:
120 - 36 = 84

After 2 weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so Ashlyn harvested:
84 x 3/4 = 63 watermelons

Remaining watermelons not ready for harvest:
84 - 63 = 21

So, 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two weeks.

230	Mark purchased 12 motorcycles for his company. One of the cars cost $20,000. He paid 10% interest on the cars plus an additional $1000 to register one of them. How much did he pay for all the parts?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

12 motorcycles x $20,000 = $240,000 (total cost)

10% interest on $240,000 = $24,000 (interest)

$240,000 (total cost) + $24,000 (interest) = $264,000

Adding the registration fee of $1000: $264,000 + $1000 = $265,000

So, Mark paid $265,000 for all the motorcycles.

In isiZulu, that's: ""U-Mark uyalithola izimali eziyi-$265,000 ukuthenga izimoto zonke."""

If half of the insects are ants, that means the number of ants is half the total number of insects. Let's use ""x"" to represent the total number of insects.

Since half of the insects are ants, we can write an equation: x/2 = 50

To find the total number of insects, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 x 2
x = 100

So, there are 100 insects in the garden! ""Kulungile!"" (It's correct!)"

234	Steve decided to start eating more tomatoes and planted his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, six a day. If a vineyard produces three tomatoes a week, how many vineyards should he have?	21	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so she eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes a day.

Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 cherry tomatoes a day.

Since a vineyard produces 3 tomatoes a week, we need to find out how many vineyards will produce 9 tomatoes a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so a vineyard produces 3 tomatoes/week × 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes a week.

To find out how many vineyards Steve needs, we can divide the number of tomatoes he needs per week (9 tomatoes/day × 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week) by the number of tomatoes a vineyard produces per week (21 tomatoes/week):

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 21 tomatoes/week/vineyard = 3 vineyards

So, Steve should have 3 vineyards to meet his cherry tomato needs!

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubalulekile ukuthi John abuyise imipizi engu-5.""

Translation: ""It's important that John buys 5 pizzas.""

Here's the calculation:
20 friends × 4 slices each = 80 slices
Since each pizza has 8 slices, John needs:
80 slices ÷ 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas
But, since you can't buy a fraction of a pizza, John should order 5 pizzas to ensure everyone gets 4 slices."

239	The hall has three entrances A, B, and C that also serve as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students left the hall through exit A, the remaining three-fifths through exit B, and the rest through exit C, calculate the number of students who left through exit C.	280	"Nzuri! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 30% of students left through exit A. This means 70% remained.
* Of the remaining 70%, three-fifths (3/5) left through exit B. This is equivalent to 60% of 70%, which is 42%.
* So, 70% - 42% = 28% of students left through exit C.

If we assume there were 100 students initially (to make calculations easier), then 28% of 100 is:

28/100 × 100 = 28 students

243	Jason has a phone bill of 1,000 minutes per month. He calls his boss 15 minutes a day, and he already has 300 minutes to call people again this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Jason's remaining minutes:

Jason has 1,000 minutes per month.
He already has 300 minutes left, so he has used 1,000 - 300 = 700 minutes.
He calls his boss 15 minutes a day, so in 30 days, he will use 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.
To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the minutes he will use from the total minutes used: 700 - 450 = 250 minutes.

244	Griffin had 24 holes, but Kyle had five. Billy had twice as many as Kyle had. Ginger gave Griffin some of her holes, but then Colby gave Griffin at least three times as many as Kyle had. If Griffin had 27 holes, how many holes did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kyle had 5 holes.
Billy had twice as many as Kyle, so Billy had 2 x 5 = 10 holes.
Colby gave Griffin at least 3 times as many as Kyle, so Colby gave Griffin at least 3 x 5 = 15 holes.
Griffin initially had 24 holes and ended up with 27 holes.

To find out how many holes Ginger gave Griffin, let's subtract the initial holes from the final holes: 27 - 24 = 3 holes.

But wait! Colby gave Griffin at least 15 holes, so it can't be that Ginger gave Griffin only 3 holes. This means Colby gave Griffin exactly 15 holes, and Ginger gave Griffin the remaining 3 holes to make up the total of 27 holes.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 3 holes.

245	If there are four turtles in one aquarium and 32 in the other, the difference between the number of turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The difference between the number of turtles is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. So, if we divide 28 by 2, we get 14.

Since the two aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide 14 by 2 to get 7.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.
