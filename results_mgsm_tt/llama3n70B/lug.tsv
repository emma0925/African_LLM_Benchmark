0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three eggs a day for breakfast and cooks four more to put in a muffin for her friends. She sells the remaining eggs at the farmer's market for $2 a day. How much does she make a day at the farmer's market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the eggs: 16 eggs - 3 eggs (breakfast) - 4 eggs (muffin) = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 a day, so she makes:

9 eggs x $2/16 eggs = $1.125 per day.

In isiZulu, ""Uyaphuma imali engu-$1.125 ngosuku."" (She earns $1.125 per day.)"
1	The measurement is two and a half cubits of blue linen and one cubit of white linen. How many cubits is the total?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

2	Josh decided to try to buy a substandard house and invest money, then sell it. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the houses he bought by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it, so he invested a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The renovation increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000.

Since Josh invested $130,000 and the new value is $120,000, he made a profit of $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000. Oops, it looks like Josh made a loss of $10,000!

In isiZulu, we say ""U Josh wayengaphansi ngama-10,000!"" (Josh is at a loss of $10,000!)"
3	James decides to run three marathons three times a week. Each runner runs 60 meters. How many meters does he run on average each week?	540	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngiyakucophelela ukuthola ukuthi James uyaphenduka ukuthi athathe amarathoni athathu athathu ngosuku olunezinhlanhla. Kuthiwa uma isitha sesithathu siyaphenduka imitha eyi-60. Ngicabanga ukuthi James uyaphenduka imitha eyi-540 ngosuku olunezinhlanhla.

(Translation: I'm happy to help you figure out that James decides to run three marathons three times a week. It's said that each runner runs 60 meters. I think James runs 540 meters on average each week.)"
4	Each day, Wendi feeds each hen three cups of freshly cooked chicken food - a mixture of kidneys, insects, and other nutrients - three times a day, with 15 cups in the morning and 25 more in the afternoon. How many cups should she feed her chickens at the last meal of the day if Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Wendi feeds each hen 3 cups, 3 times a day. That's 3 x 3 = 9 cups per hen per day. With 20 chickens, that's 20 x 9 = 180 cups of food per day.

She already gave 15 cups in the morning and 25 more in the afternoon, so that's 15 + 25 = 40 cups. To find out how many cups she should feed at the last meal, we subtract 40 from 180: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

So, Wendi should feed her chickens 140 cups at the last meal of the day.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
5	Kylar went to the store to buy her new calendar glasses. One glass costs $5 but each second glass costs 60% of that price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does she need to pay for them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and each second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, the total cost will be:
$5 (first glass) + 15 x $3 (15 second glasses) = $5 + $45 = $50

Kylar needs to pay $50 for the 16 glasses.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

In total, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

7	Carla downloads 200 GB of data. Normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute, but when she reaches 40% of the downloaded data, her computer shuts down, so that the next update takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to download the data again from the beginning. How long will it take to download the data?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Carla downloads 200 GB of data, and normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it takes to download 200 GB, we can divide 200 GB by 2 GB/minute:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, when she reaches 40% of the downloaded data, her computer shuts down. 40% of 200 GB is:

200 GB × 0.4 = 80 GB

Since she downloads 2 GB per minute, it takes her:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

to reach 40% of the downloaded data. Then, her computer shuts down, and she has to wait 20 minutes before restarting.

After the restart, she has to download the data again from the beginning. It will take her another:

100 minutes

to download the entire 200 GB.

So, in total, it will take Carla:

40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (waiting) + 100 minutes (re-download) = 160 minutes

to download the data.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking, my friend!"
8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour but turns back because he realizes that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in heavy traffic. He spends the next half hour swimming at 30 miles per hour before regaining the ability to swim at 80 miles per hour in the remaining 4 hours. How long does it take him to get home in 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

2. He turns back and spends the first 2 hours in heavy traffic, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time =? x 2 (we don't know the speed, but it's not important for now)

3. He spends the next half hour swimming at 30 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He regains the ability to swim at 80 miles per hour in the remaining 4 hours, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles

To get home, John needs to cover the remaining distance:
Remaining distance = Initial distance - Distance covered in traffic - Distance covered swimming
= 180 -? - 15
(since we don't know the distance covered in traffic, let's call it x)
= 180 - x - 15

John covers this remaining distance in 4 hours at 80 miles per hour, so:
Remaining distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles

Equating the two expressions for the remaining distance, we get:
180 - x - 15 = 320
x = 180 - 320 + 15
x = -125 miles (this means John was 125 miles away from home when he got out of traffic)

Now, let's find the total time taken for John to get home:
Total time = 3 hours (initial driving) + 2 hours (traffic) + 0.5 hours (swimming) + 4 hours (remaining distance)
= 9.5 hours

So, it takes John 9.5 hours to get home.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
9	Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of the week is $10 (U.S.), plus an overtime bonus that is 1.2 times what she would have earned if she had worked 45 hours this week.	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10/hour, so she earns:
40 hours x $10/hour = $400

If she had worked 45 hours, she would have earned:
45 hours x $10/hour = $450

The overtime bonus is 1.2 times what she would have earned if she had worked 45 hours, so:
$450 x 1.2 = $540

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
$400 (regular earnings) + $540 (overtime bonus) = $940

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Izindleko zakhe zonyaka ngomsebenzi wakhe ku-$940."" (Her weekly earnings from her job are $940.)"
10	The new app received 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads tripled in the second month, but decreased by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the app get during those three months?	366	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 60 x 3 = 180 downloads (tripled)
Month 3: 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads (decreased by 30%)

Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

11	Toula went to the grocery store and bought dog food. She bought 3 tablespoons of donuts for $68 each, 2 tablespoons of small cakes for $80 each, and 6 tablespoons of cheesecake for $55 each. How much did she buy?	694	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Toula spent:

3 tablespoons of donuts = 3 x $68 = $204
2 tablespoons of small cakes = 2 x $80 = $160
6 tablespoons of cheesecake = 6 x $55 = $330

Total amount = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Kubonga! (Well done!) Toula spent $694."
12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. It costs $90 to plant a tree. A year to grow 7 lemons he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water the lemon tree. How many years will it take for the lemon tree to start making money.	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit:

Yearly profit = Number of lemons x Price per lemon - Watering cost
= 7 lemons x $1.5 - $3
= $10.50 - $3
= $7.50 per year

Initial cost = $90

To find the break-even point, divide the initial cost by the yearly profit:
$90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for the lemon tree to start making money.

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthula! (I hope that helps!)"
13	Melanie is a salesperson. She sold a third of her kit of vacuum cleaners to the green house, sold 2 more to the red house, and sold half to the papal house from what she had left. If Melanie had 5 mobile phones left, how many did she have when she started selling?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 1/3 of her kit to the green house. This means she had 2/3 left.

Then, she sold 2 more to the red house. Let's assume she had x items left after selling to the green house. She sold 2, so she had x - 2 left.

After that, she sold half of what she had left to the papal house. This means she had (x - 2)/2 left.

We know she had 5 mobile phones left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 2)/2 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12

So, Melanie had 12 items left after selling to the green house. Since she sold 1/3 to the green house, she had 12 * 3/2 = 18 items initially.

14	In the dance class, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% enrolled in Jazz dance, and the remainder enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of students enrolled in Hip-hop dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in Hip-hop dance:

100% (total) - 20% (modern dance) = 80%
80% - 25% (jazz dance) = 55%

So, 55% of students enrolled in Hip-hop dance.

15	A businessman is faced with a choice between two purchases: $5,000 worth of cosmetics or $8,000 worth of electricity. His financial advisor estimates that the market for cosmetics will go up 2.5% and electricity will go up 1.2% in the same month. If the businessman has to choose the one with the highest profit by the end of the month, how much profit will it make?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For cosmetics: $5,000 x 2.5% = $125 profit
For electricity: $8,000 x 1.2% = $96 profit

The businessman should choose the cosmetics, which will give him a profit of $125 by the end of the month.

16	Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They start traveling westward, each traveling 80 miles [80 km], and the next day they travel northward for 150 miles [150 km]. How much does each train travel on these two days?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi inani eliphelele le-train kuya ngale ndlela. (Let me help you find the total distance each train travels.)

Ukuthola ukuthi inani eliphelele, sizokubala inani eliphelele ngokuqhubeka ngokwezinhlanu. (To find the total distance, we will add the distances traveled on each day.)

Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

Inani eliphelele = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

Kuyafana ukuthi le-train liyaphuma ngaphandle kwezinhlanu ezintathu, libuye libuye ngaphandle kwezinhlanu ezintathu. (It means each train travels a total distance of 230 miles.)

17	If Jill works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to know her hourly wage. Let's assume her hourly wage as a teacher is R200 (Rands) and as a coach is R150.

As a teacher, she works 50 weeks/year × 35 hours/week = 1750 hours/year
Her annual salary as a teacher = 1750 hours/year × R200/hour = R350,000/year

As a coach, she works 50 weeks/year × 15 hours/week = 750 hours/year
Her annual salary as a coach = 750 hours/year × R150/hour = R112,500/year

Her total annual salary = R350,000/year + R112,500/year = R462,500/year

19	Marissa walks 12 miles. She walks the first two miles in an hour, then the next two miles in an hour. If she wants to run at 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) does she need to go?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Marissa walks 12 miles in total. She walks 2 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour, which means she has walked 2 + 2 = 4 miles in 2 hours.

To finish the remaining 12 - 4 = 8 miles, she wants to run at 4 miles per hour. To find out how many hours it will take her, we can divide the remaining distance by her running speed:

8 miles ÷ 4 miles/hour = 2 hours

So, she needs to maintain a speed of 4 miles per hour to finish the remaining 8 miles in 2 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
20	I have ten quarts of orange juice with two thirds water in it, and I want to add fifteen quarts of pineapple juice with three-fifths water in it. But when I divide it, I count one quart of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 quarts?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

You have 10 quarts of orange juice with 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the orange juice is:
10 x 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 quarts (approximately)

You add 15 quarts of pineapple juice with 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the pineapple juice is:
15 x 3/5 = 9 quarts

Total water = 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 quarts

But you've lost 1 quart of orange juice, so you subtract 1 quart from the total:
24 - 1 = 23 quarts

Now, you want to know how much water is left in 24 quarts. Since you've lost 1 quart, you'll calculate the water percentage for 23 quarts:
Total water ÷ Total juice = 15.67 ÷ 23 = 0.68 (approximately)

So, the water percentage is approximately 68%. To find the amount of water in 24 quarts, multiply the percentage by 24:
0.68 × 24 = 16.32 quarts

Therefore, there are approximately 16.32 quarts of water left in 24 quarts.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. These are usually 25% off the original price. How much was the book before they sold it?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price.

Let x be the original price.

Since it's 25% off, that means the discount is 0.25x.

The selling price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Simplifying the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75:

x = 26.00

So, the book was $26.00 before they sold it.

25	Marie ordered a chicken for $12, 5 pints of milk for $3, 4 apples for $1.50, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie send, if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the costs:

* Chicken: $12
* 5 pints of milk: $3
* 4 apples: $1.50
* Total cost of these items: $12 + $3 + $1.50 = $16.50

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is:
$50 - $16.50 = $33.50

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is:
$33.50 ÷ $8.50 = 4

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Marie bought 4 boxes of pizza."
26	Mishka bought 3 short sleeves, 3 long sleeves, and 3 pairs of shoes. 1 short sleeve costs $16.50, 1 long sleeve costs $22.50 and 1 pair of shoes costs $42. How much did Mishka spend on all the clothes he bought?	243	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

3 short sleeves = 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
3 long sleeves = 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
3 pairs of shoes = 3 x $42 = $126

Total amount = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothes he bought.

29	Gloria is a shoe buyer who usually finds a new pair of shoes in her closet. Instead she has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of leather shoes for which she spends five dollars to buy two pairs of shoes. If a pair of leather shoes costs $33 and the second one is twice as much, how much are the boots worth?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Gloria spends $5 to buy two pairs of shoes. So, the total cost of the two pairs of leather shoes is $5.

Let the cost of the first pair of leather shoes be x. Then, the second pair costs 2x.

We know that x + 2x = $5. Simplifying, we get 3x = $5.

Now, divide both sides by 3: x = $5/3 = $1.67.

So, the first pair of leather shoes costs $1.67, and the second pair costs 2x = 2($1.67) = $3.34.

Now, we know that Gloria spends $5 to buy two pairs of shoes. The total cost of the two pairs of leather shoes is $1.67 + $3.34 = $5.

Since Gloria spends $5, the boots must be free! In Zulu, we say ""Akukho mali!"" (There's no money!)

So, the boots are worth $0!"
30	The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of . . . to 7:11. Add up their ages to 162 and figure out how many years Allen will live in 10 years from now.	109	"Jambo! (Hello!) In Swahili, I'll help you with that.

Let's break it down:

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.

We know their ages add up to 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now, we can find Darrell's age and Allen's age:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

In 10 years, Allen's age will be:

99 + 10 = 109

So, in 10 years, Allen will be 109 years old.

31	Gunter tries to count the number of jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends to tell him how many jelly beans they think he has in the jar. One says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, another says there are 20 more than the average, and a third says there are 25% more than the average. What is the average of their estimates?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. One friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. Another says 20 more than the average. Let's call the average ""x"". Then, this friend's estimate is x + 20.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the average. That's 1.25x.

(80 + (x + 20) + 1.25x) / 3 = x

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x + 20 + 1.25x = 3x
100 + 2.25x = 3x
100 = 0.75x
x = 133.33

So, the average of their estimates is approximately 133 jelly beans.

35	Mike plays table tennis for 40 minutes; in the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 goals; in the next 20 minutes, he scores another 25%.	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mike scores 4 goals in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, multiply 4 by 0.25.

4 × 0.25 = 1

So, Mike scores 1 more goal in the next 20 minutes. In total, he scores:

4 (initial goals) + 1 (additional goal) = 5 goals

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi uMike usho ukuphelele 5 amagoli! (I hope that's correct, Mike scores 5 goals!)"
36	Terry drinks yogurt 2 times a day. Currently the yogurt on the market sells for 4 yogurts at $5.00. How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Terry drinks yogurt 2 times a day, so in 30 days, he'll drink:

2 times/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, we can find the cost of 1 yogurt:

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, let's find out how much Terry spends on yogurt in 30 days:

60 yogurts × $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt in 30 days.

37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has licenses to build 13 houses for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and $5. How many building licenses does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells licenses to build 13 houses for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

Plus $5, so he spends a total of:
$160 + $5 = $165

He's left with:
$195 - $165 = $30

To find out how many building licenses he has left, we divide the remaining money by the price of each license:
$30 ÷ $15 = 2

So, John has 2 building licenses left.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
38	John runs 60 miles [60 km] a week, three days a week. On the first day, he runs three and a half hours faster than he does on the next two days.	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi John uyaphenduka kangaki? (Let me calculate how far John runs.)

Uphenduka 60 miles emvikweni wesihlanu, kodwa uyaphenduka izinsuku ezintathu. (He runs 60 miles a week, but he runs three days a week.)

Kuthiwa kusasa kwesokugcina, uyaphenduka amahora athathu neminyaka emithathu kuphela. (It's said that on the first day, he runs three and a half hours faster than the next two days.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi uyaphenduka amakhilomitha angu-20 emahora emithathu. (I think he runs 20 kilometers in three hours.)

Kuthiwa kusasa kwesibili, uyaphenduka amahora amane. (It's said that on the second day, he runs four hours.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi uyaphenduka amakhilomitha angu-26.67 emahora amane. (I think he runs 26.67 kilometers in four hours.)

Kuthiwa kusasa kwesithathu, uyaphenduka amahora amane. (It's said that on the third day, he runs four hours.)

39	Dana can run at four times the speed she walks, but she can stop and walk at half the speed. If she can walk at two miles [3 km] an hour, how many miles can she cover in six hours if she spends one third of that time running and two thirds of that time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

If Dana walks at 2 miles per hour, she runs at 4 times that speed, which is 2 x 4 = 8 miles per hour.

She spends 1/3 of the 6 hours running, which is 6 x 1/3 = 2 hours. In those 2 hours, she covers 2 x 8 = 16 miles.

She spends 2/3 of the 6 hours walking, which is 6 x 2/3 = 4 hours. But she walks at half her normal speed, which is 2 x 1/2 = 1 mile per hour. In those 4 hours, she covers 4 x 1 = 4 miles.

Adding the miles covered while running and walking, we get 16 + 4 = 20 miles.

41	Perg, a fierce fire-breathing serpent, perched on the summit of Mount Farbo, spewing fire at everything within 1,000 feet. Polly had the ability to hurl a golden spear, the only weapon capable of destroying a fire-breathing serpent, 400 feet high, into the serpent's lair. But when Polly touched a sapphire stone, she could hurl a spear so far away that it flew three times over the valley floor without hitting a sapphire stone. If she touched this stone, how high would Polly have to be to stand outside the fire-breathing serpent's lair, and could the fire-breathing serpent be fired with a golden spear?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukuthola ukuthi uPolly kufanele abe khona ekutheni?""

Let's calculate the distance Polly needs to stand:

The serpent's lair is 1,000 feet high, and Polly can hurl the spear 3 times the valley floor without hitting a sapphire stone. Assuming the valley floor is the same height as the serpent's lair, that's 3 x 1,000 = 3,000 feet.

Since Polly can hurl the spear 400 feet high normally, with the sapphire stone, she can hurl it 3,000 - 400 = 2,600 feet higher.

So, Polly needs to stand at least 2,600 feet away from the serpent's lair to hit it with the golden spear.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""uPolly kufanele abe khona ekutheni ekuphakameni kwesikhathi esingama-2,600 amafutha.""

Yes, with the sapphire stone, Polly can destroy the fire-breathing serpent with a golden spear!"
42	Grandmother Jones baked five apples for the fireman's lunch, cut each one into eight pieces, and placed all five on the table where the guests were served. By the end of the evening, after the guests had picked and eaten all their pieces, there were 14 left over.	26	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, let's count!)

Grandmother Jones baked 5 apples and cut each into 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total.

After the guests ate, 14 pieces were left over. To find out how many pieces the guests ate, we subtract the leftovers from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests ate 26 pieces of apple!"
43	If a 300-pound sack of food contains 5 servings, how many calories would you consume if the 2,000-pound sack of food per day contained 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If a 300-pound sack has 5 servings, then one serving is equal to 300 ÷ 5 = 60 pounds.

Now, if the 2,000-pound sack has 1,800 calories, then one pound is equal to 1,800 ÷ 2,000 = 0.9 calories.

Since one serving is 60 pounds, the calories per serving would be 60 × 0.9 = 54 calories.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
44	Charlie wants to sell candles made from honeycombs. For every pound of honeycombs he can make 10 candles. One pound and a string of candles cost $10.00 at retail. If each candle sells for $2.00, how much profit does he make selling 20 candles?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 pound of honeycombs makes 10 candles.
Cost of 1 pound of honeycombs and a string of candles = $10.00
Selling price of 1 candle = $2.00

Cost of 1 candle = $10.00 ÷ 10 candles = $1.00 per candle
Profit per candle = $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00

Selling 20 candles, profit = 20 candles × $1.00 = $20.00

Umphakathi, Charlie makes a profit of $20.00 selling 20 candles! (That's ""congratulations"" in Zulu!)"
45	Meredith writes a blog on health insurance to send to readers every day as her full-time job. A speech takes her an average of 4 hours to research and write on it. Last week, she wrote 5 speeches on Tuesday, and on Tuesday she wrote two-fifths as many as she did on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many speeches as she wrote on Tuesday. Check out the total number of hours she spent writing speeches on all three days.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 5 speeches. It takes her 4 hours to research and write one speech, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many speeches as Tuesday, so she wrote 5 x 2 = 10 speeches. It takes her 4 hours to research and write one speech, so she spent 10 x 4 = 40 hours on Wednesday.

On Thursday, she wrote two-fifths as many speeches as Tuesday, so she wrote (2/5) x 5 = 2 speeches. It takes her 4 hours to research and write one speech, so she spent 2 x 4 = 8 hours on Thursday.

In total, Meredith spent 20 + 40 + 8 = 68 hours writing speeches on all three days.

46	Before leaving for her coffee-shop job, Candice packed 80 sheets into her handbag, stood in the store, and bought a roll of additional sheets; at work, she distributed one sheet for each of the 220 cups of coffee she had ordered. If she had 23 sheets, how many sheets were in her roll?	163	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Candice started with 80 sheets in her handbag.
She bought a roll of additional sheets, so we'll call that x.
She distributed 220 sheets at work, leaving her with 23 sheets.

Let's set up an equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23

Solving for x, we get: x = 163

So, the roll of additional sheets had 163 sheets.

47	John's red ties cost twice as much as his blue ones. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones. He spent $200 on the blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the ties?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue ties

Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones, the red ties cost:

$40 x 1.5 = $60 each

The problem states that the red ties cost twice as much as the blue ones, so the number of red ties is half the number of blue ties:

5 blue ties ÷ 2 = 2.5 red ties (but you can't buy a fraction of a tie, so let's round down to 2 red ties)

He spent:

2 red ties x $60 each = $120 on red ties

Total amount spent on ties:

$200 (blue) + $120 (red) = $320

Let's break it down:

Uriah needs to lift 15 pounds of books. He has 30 storybooks, each weighing a quarter of a pound, so that's:

30 storybooks x 0.25 pounds/storybook = 7.5 pounds

He still needs to lift 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more.

His textbooks weigh half a pound each, so he needs:

7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds/textbook = 15 textbooks

So, Uriah needs 15 textbooks to reach his 15-pound goal!"

57	A wooden bridge carries a weight of less than 5000 pounds. A truck carrying identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, is allowed to cross the bridge. The weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can this vehicle reach without exceeding its own weight to cross the bridge?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi: (Let me calculate...)

Izimpahla zonke (Total weight) = Ukudla kwesitimela (Weight of the vehicle) + amaphoxo (Weight of the boxes)
Izimpahla zonke < 5000 (Total weight is less than 5000 pounds)

Ukudla kwesitimela = 3755 pounds
Izimpahla zonke = 3755 + (15 x inani labaphoxo) < 5000

Inani labaphoxo (Number of boxes) = (5000 - 3755) / 15
Inani labaphoxo = 824 / 15
Inani labaphoxo = 55

Kusho ukuthi (So) the vehicle can carry 55 boxes without exceeding the weight limit.

Let's break it down:

* 1 orange is ripe
* 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, which is 0.2 x 25 = 5 oranges
* 2 oranges are green
* The rest are unripe, which means we subtract the ripe, unripe, and green oranges from the total: 25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17 oranges

So, 17 oranges are unripe.

(I love you!) Let's calculate the total amount Aleena paid.

For the first 6 months, Aleena paid $140/month, so she paid a total of:
6 months × $140/month = $840

For the next 6 months, Aleena paid an additional 10%, which is:
$140/month × 0.10 = $14/month extra
So, she paid:
$140/month + $14/month = $154/month

For the next 6 months, Aleena paid a total of:
6 months × $154/month = $924

Now, let's add the amounts for both halves of the year:
$840 + $924 = $1,764

So, Aleena paid a total of $1,764 at the end of the year.

66	There are 4 schools competing in the championship. Each school has sent a girls' and boys' team and each team has 5 players. Each school has also sent a coach to each team. How many people in total have all the schools sent?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi: (Let me calculate...)

Izikhungo ezine zesikole (4 schools) zine amaqembu amabili (2 teams each) = 4 x 2 = 8 amaqembu (8 teams)

Amaqembu amahlanu (5 players each) = 8 x 5 = 40 abadlali (40 players)

Izikhungo ezine zesikole (4 schools) zine amacoachi amabili (2 coaches each) = 4 x 2 = 8 amacoachi (8 coaches)

Ngithatha ukuthi: (In total...)

40 abadlali (40 players) + 8 amacoachi (8 coaches) = 48 abantu (48 people)

Sawubona! (Hello!) There are 48 people in total."
67	A treasure hunter found a chest buried deep in the earth filled with precious stones. Inside were 175 rubies, with 35 rubies overlaying the door, and emeralds, twice the size of rubies.	595	"""Oriki omo olorun, omo alejo, omo asiko! (Praise be to the child of God, the child of wealth, the child of fortune!) 

Let us count the treasure together! 

Rubies: 175 - 35 = 140 rubies inside the chest. 

Emeralds: If emeralds are twice the size of rubies, that means we have 140 x 2 = 280 emeralds. 

So, the treasure hunter found 140 rubies and 280 emeralds! Olorun a wo wa o! (God has blessed us!)"""
68	There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls for every 5 students, how many teachers are there?	36	"Nkɔ́bɛ́n! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. If there are 60 girls for every 5 students, that means the total number of students is 60 + 60 = 120 (since there are twice as many boys as girls).

Now, the question asks about the number of teachers, but there's no information about that. So, I'll say ""Mmɛ́nɛ́nɛ́"" (I don't know)"
69	Bailey has a starting salary of $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if he has a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Bailey wayenayo imali ekupheleni kwesikhathi esiyi-8. (Let's find out how much Bailey had at the end of the 8 weeks.)

Ngicula imali ekupheleni kubonga imali ekupheleni: $100 - $40 = $60 (Amount Bailey had initially: $100 - $40 = $60)

Kusho ukuthi Bailey wayenayo imali engu-$60 ekupheleni kwesikhathi esiyi-8. (So Bailey had $60 initially.)"
70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes a day on weekdays. She teaches 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she teaches each student $15.00, how much does she make in 1 week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Weekdays: 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes
Saturday: 8 classes
Total classes in a week: 25 + 8 = 33 classes

Each class has 15 students, so total students in a week: 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students

Each student pays $15.00, so total earnings in a week: 495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425.00

(Translation: If he sells 43 brownies at $3 each, he gets $129. If he sells 23 cheesecakes at $4 each, he gets $92. When you add them together, he gets $129 + $92 = $221.)"
73	Shiela bought 5 mobile phones at a cost of $150 each and paid for them in 3 months. Each one with an interest rate of 2%. How much will Shiela pay per month for 3 months?	255	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) in isiZulu.

Let's calculate the total cost of the mobile phones:
5 phones × $150 each = $750

The interest rate is 2% per month, so the interest for 3 months is:
$750 × 2% × 3 = $45

The total amount Shiela needs to pay is:
$750 + $45 = $795

To find out how much she'll pay per month for 3 months:
$795 ÷ 3 = $265 per month.

In isiZulu, ""UShiela uzobhadala imali engu-$265 ngomzuzwana ongama-3."" (Shiela will pay $265 per month for 3 months.)"
74	Artie has a small flower shop at the farmers' market. He sells three types of flowers: marigold, petunia and begonia. He usually sells marigold for $2.74 a bushel, petunia for $1.87 a bushel and begonia for $2.12 a bushel. Artie has not made any changes to the list, deciding to keep all prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, will he save money?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi Artie uyakuthola imali. (Let me help you figure out if Artie will save money.)

Artie sells marigold for $2.74, but he rounds it to $2. So, 12 pots of marigolds will cost 12 x $2 = $24.

He sells petunia for $1.87, but he rounds it to $2. So, 9 pots of petunias will cost 9 x $2 = $18.

He sells begonia for $2.12, but he rounds it to $2. So, 17 pots of begonias will cost 17 x $2 = $34.

In total, Artie will make $24 + $18 + $34 = $76.

Since Artie is selling flowers, he will make money, not save money. Ukuthola kwamuhle! (It's a good deal!)"
75	Luke spends a day on the beach building two sandy houses, and then he figures out that each floor of the sandy palace should be half the height of the one below it. If he were to make four sandy slabs of the same size, totaling 16 square feet, what would be the average height of the two sandy slabs?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ukuthola ukuthi i-sandy slab sesi-4 siphinda sibe ngama-square feet ayi-16, kufanele siqonde ukuthi inani lesi-slab ngalinye libe ngama-4 square feet.

Ukuthola ukuthi i-average height yalesi-slab ngalinye libe yi-4/2 = 2 square feet.

76	According to her veterinarian, she has to take care of the dog by giving it 1 cup of dog food a day for the first 180 days. Then she has to give the dog 2 cups of dog food a day for the rest of her life. If a dog food bag contains 110 cups, how many dog food bags will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia gives the dog 1 cup of food per day. That's a total of 180 cups.

After that, she gives the dog 2 cups per day. There are 365 days in a year, so for the remaining 185 days (365 - 180), she'll give the dog 2 cups per day. That's an additional 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, Cecilia will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year.

Since each bag contains 110 cups, she'll need 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food.

77	If Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, then Sarah does four times as much laundry as David does. Calculate how many clothes Raymond and David do if Sarah's laundry weighs 400 pounds.	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If Sarah's laundry weighs 400 pounds, and Raymond does half of it, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

Since Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

So, Raymond and David do 200 + 100 = 300 pounds of laundry.

78	Vincent can buy 3 sets of flowers for $2.50 or 2 sets of flowers for $1. How much does he save if he buys 18 flowers at the right price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If Vincent buys 3 sets of flowers for $2.50, that means 1 set of flowers costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83.

If he buys 2 sets of flowers for $1, that means 1 set of flowers costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50.

To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 ÷ 3 = 6 sets of flowers (since 1 set has 3 flowers).

If he buys at $0.83 per set, he'll pay 6 sets × $0.83 = $5.00.

If he buys at $0.50 per set, he'll pay 6 sets × $0.50 = $3.00.

So, he saves $5.00 - $3.00 = $2.00 by buying at the right price!

81	Charlie only has 10 cents. He bought 21 cents from a department store and had 23 cents to paint for his birthday party. Then Charlie gave 9 cents to his sister and used 28 cents to make a greeting card. How many cents does Charlie have left?	17	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Charlie anikele 10 cents. (Charlie had 10 cents.)
Wabonga 21 cents kudepartment store. (He bought 21 cents from a department store.)
Waba nezincwadi 23 cents ukuphatha umhlambi wakhe. (He had 23 cents to paint for his birthday party.)
Ngemuva kweso, Charlie wabonga 9 cents kusasa lakhe. (Then Charlie gave 9 cents to his sister.)
Wabonga 28 cents ukwenza ikhadi lokucophelela. (He used 28 cents to make a greeting card.)

Ukubonga kwakhe kwaba yini? (How much does he have left?)

Let's calculate:

10 cents (initial amount) + 23 cents (left after buying) = 33 cents
33 cents - 9 cents (given to sister) = 24 cents
24 cents - 28 cents (used for greeting card) = -4 cents (he doesn't have enough)

82	Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex is twice Grace's weight and four times Gace's. How much do they both weigh in pounds?	623	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex is twice Grace's weight, so Alex weighs 2 x 125 = 250 pounds.

Gace's weight is not given, but Alex is four times Gace's weight, so Gace weighs 250 ÷ 4 = 62.5 pounds.

So, Alex and Gace together weigh 250 + 62.5 = 312.5 pounds.

84	The football team played 22 games, they won 8 more games than they lost. How many matches did they win?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Igemu lika futbol elidlala amagemu 22, libhale igamu elinganayo ku-8 kulokho baelidle. Igemu elingabi?

(Translation: The football team played 22 games, they won 8 more games than they lost. How many matches did they win?)

Let's say they lost x games. Then, they won x + 8 games.

We know they played 22 games in total, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. To find the number of games they won, add 8:

7 + 8 = 15

Igemu elingabi? Igemu elingabi 15! (How many matches did they win? They won 15 matches!)"
85	Geneatunga makes a commemorative bedspread out of old commemorative shirts. She has one shirt from each of her vacation spots. Each shirt has its own carpet on this bedspread. Each dress is made out of shirts from different age groups of her vacation spots. She goes on vacation 4 times a year and has been going there since she was 23 years old. She is 34 years old. How many sets of shirts do you have in total?	44	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Geneatunga goes on vacation 4 times a year.
She has been going on vacation since she was 23 years old.
She is currently 34 years old.

To find out how many years she has been going on vacation, subtract 23 from 34: 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since she goes on vacation 4 times a year, multiply the number of years by 4: 11 x 4 = 44.

So, Geneatunga has 44 shirts in total, which means she has 44 sets of shirts.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Ugeneatunga unezihlobo zeshirt eziyisishiyagalolwazi eziyi-44!"" (Geneatunga has 44 sets of commemorative shirts!)"

87	The company pays its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for employees who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, how much salary will she earn annually after another three years working there?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sylvie's starting salary is $600 per month. Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she gets a 10% increase annually.

10% of $600 = $60
New monthly salary = $600 + $60 = $660

After 1 year, another 10% increase:
10% of $660 = $66
New monthly salary = $660 + $66 = $726

After 2 years, another 10% increase:
10% of $726 = $72.60
New monthly salary = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

After 3 years, another 10% increase:
10% of $798.60 = $79.86
New monthly salary = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Annual salary = $878.46 x 12 = $10,541.52

Sylvie's annual salary after 3 years will be $10,541.52.

88	Marilyn's first song sold ten times as many copies as Harald's, if the two combined sold 88,000 copies.	8000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Marilyn's song sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's say Harald's song sold x copies. Then Marilyn's song sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald's song sold 8,000 copies, and Marilyn's song sold 10 times that, which is 80,000 copies.

89	Christina is planning a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags to give to each guest, because 1/4 of the guests will not come. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2. How much will she spend?	24	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

UChristina ufisa ukuthenga amagile asebenza ngamaphesenti angu-75, ngoba amakhosazana angu-1/4 ayowuthola. Wayibiza amakhosazana angu-16. Amagile asebenza angu-2 ngokudla ngokubonga.

(Christina wants to buy 75 gift bags because 1/4 of the guests will not come. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2.)

Ukuthola ukuthi u-1/4 awutholi, kufanele siqonde ukuthi amakhosazana angu-16 angu-4 ayowuthola. Okunye, uChristina ufisa ukuthenga amagile asebenza angu-75, okwamanje kufanele siqonde ukuthi amakhosazana angu-16 - 4 = 12 angawuthola. Ngakho, uChristina ufisa ukuthenga amagile asebenza angu-12.

(To find out how many will not come, we need to calculate that 1/4 of 16 is 4 who will not come. Therefore, Christina wants to buy 75 gift bags, but now we need to calculate that 16 - 4 = 12 will come.)

Ngakho, uChristina uzothenga amagile asebenza angu-12, okwamanje kufanele siqonde ukuthi amagile asebenza angu-2 ngokudla ngokubonga. Ukuthenga amagile asebenza angu-12 ngokudla ngokubonga angu-2, kufanele siqonde ukuthi uChristina uzothenga ngokudla ngokubonga angu-24.

(Therefore, Christina will buy 12 gift bags, and now we need to calculate that each gift bag costs $2. Buying 12 gift bags at $2 each, we need to calculate that Christina will spend $24.)

UChristina uzothenga ngokudla ngokubonga angu-24."

(Understanding that 20 adults eat 10 pounds each, and 5 children eat half of that.)

Ukuthola ukuthi ukudla okufunyanwa kuya ngama-20 x 10 = 200 pounds. Ukuthola ukuthi ukudla okufunyanwa kuya ngama-5 x 5 = 25 pounds.

(Understanding that the total food needed is 200 pounds for adults and 25 pounds for children.)

Ukuthola ukuthi ukudla okufunyanwa kuya ngama-200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

93	Lee was able to sprint 400 meters at twice Gerald's speed, but Gerald changed his speed, increasing his speed by 10%. If Lee can sprint 400 meters in 38 seconds, how much speed can Gerald use since he changed his speed to sprint the same distance in 38 seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Lee wayeka ukuthutha imitha engu-400 ngokushesha okwethu Gerald's isikhathi, kodwa Gerald wachitha isikhathi sakhe, wakukhuphula ngokushesha okwethu 10%. Uma Lee angathutha imitha engu-400 ngamasekondi angu-38, ingabe Gerald ingakhuphula kanjani ukuthutha imitha engu-400 ngamasekondi angu-38?

Now, let's solve it:

If Lee's speed is twice Gerald's original speed, then Gerald's original speed is half of Lee's speed. Lee's speed is 400 meters in 38 seconds, so his speed is 400/38 = 10.53 meters per second.

Gerald's original speed is half of that, which is 10.53/2 = 5.26 meters per second.

Now, Gerald increases his speed by 10%, so his new speed is 5.26 x 1.1 = 5.786 meters per second.

To find the time it takes Gerald to sprint 400 meters at this new speed, we can divide the distance by the speed: 400/5.786 = 38 seconds.

So, Gerald's new speed is approximately 5.786 meters per second."

95	Of the 200 fifth-grade students, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls, but how many girls are not members of the Girl Scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Two-fifths of 200 is 2/5 × 200 = 80 boys.

Two-thirds of 200 is 2/3 × 200 = 133.33 (round down to 133 girls, since we can't have a fraction of a student).

So, there are 133 girls in total. If all girls are members of the Girl Scouts, that means 133 girls are members. But the question asks how many girls are NOT members of the Girl Scouts. Since we don't have any information about Girl Scout membership, we can't determine the exact number of girls who are not members. Let's say x girls are not members.

We can set up an equation: 133 (total girls) = x (girls not in Girl Scouts) +? (girls in Girl Scouts)

We don't have enough information to solve for x. Sorry, my friend!

Some of the cars pass in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then another 20 cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 cars leave in a row with the intention of avoiding the traffic jam. If at the beginning there were 30 cars on this road, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kwakuthola ukuthi kukhona amakasi angu-30 ekuseni. (There were 30 cars in the beginning.)

Ama-5 akhuluma ukuthi ayosusa ukudlala ngokucopheleleyo. (5 cars left to avoid the traffic jam.)

Kuthiwa amacasi angu-20 ayaphinda ayosusa emizuzwini eyodwa. (20 cars passed in the remaining 15 minutes.)

Ukuthola ukuthi amacasi angu-30 - 5 = 25 ayaphinda ayosusa. (25 cars passed in total.)

Ama-20 ayaphinda ayosusa emizuzwini eyodwa, kuthiwa amacasi angu-25 - 20 = 5 ayosusa emizuzwini eyokuqala. (5 cars passed in the first 15 minutes.)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi amacasi angu-5 ayosusa emizuzwini eyokuqala. (I conclude that 5 cars passed in the first 15 minutes.)"
99	Mary is an avid gardener. Last month she received 18 new plants hidden in jars of her favorite food. She has already planted 2 jars of her garden plants on each of her 40 windows in her big country house. Feeling the need to be generous, she decides to give 1 plant from each window to her friends and family for the next day. How many jars of garden plants will Mary have left?	58	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mary received 18 new plants hidden in jars of her favorite food.
She planted 2 jars of plants on each of her 40 windows, so she used 2 x 40 = 80 jars.
But she only had 18 jars, so she must have used 18 jars.
Then, she gave 1 plant from each window to her friends and family, which means she gave away 40 plants.
So, Mary has 18 - 40 = -22 plants left. But since you can't have a negative number of plants, it means she has 0 plants left.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umary uyena izipani ezingama-0!"" (Mary has 0 plants left!)"
100	Jerome was visited by four friends who came to visit him one day: The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, he rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first; the third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth; and if the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first, so 20 ÷ 4 = 5 times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth, so 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times the doorbell rang:

20 + 5 + 70 + 60 = 155

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The doorbell rang 155 times.

102	John likes to drink a glass of water in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, and another glass of water before going to bed. He does this every day on weekdays, but on weekends he takes a break and has a soda for dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Let's count!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

John drinks 4 glasses of water on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 3 glasses on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

On weekdays, he drinks 4 glasses/day × 5 days = 20 glasses.

On weekends, he drinks 3 glasses/day × 2 days = 6 glasses.

In total, John drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water per week.

104	Poppy makes a 1000-piece puzzle. She puts 1/4 of the pieces on the board, and her mother puts 1/3 of the remaining pieces. How many puzzle pieces are left to make?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces and puts 1/4 of them on the board. That's 1000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces.

She has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mother puts 1/3 of the remaining pieces, which is 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Now, they have 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to make.

108	Henry is preparing cookies for a local cook-off. He wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. When he finishes cooking, he finds that he has left out 15 cookies. 5 cookies fell out while he was lying on the floor, and now he has 110. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Henry has 110 cookies now.
He lost 5 cookies while lying on the floor, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before that.
He also left out 15 cookies, so he had 115 + 15 = 130 cookies initially.
He wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so if we divide 130 by 2, we get the number of cookies he baked last year: 130 ÷ 2 = 65.

So, Henry baked 65 cookies last year.

109	A gas station sells it for $3.00 per gallon. The company's app charges $.20 per gallon to anyone who fills gas at the station. If a person buys more than 10 gallons of gas, how much will his gas be, after receiving a refund?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Price per gallon: $3.00
* App charge per gallon: $0.20
* Total cost per gallon: $3.00 + $0.20 = $3.20
* If a person buys more than 10 gallons, let's say 12 gallons:
* Total cost: 12 gallons x $3.20 = $38.40
* Refund for buying more than 10 gallons: unknown, but let's assume it's $1.00 per gallon above 10 gallons. So, 2 gallons x $1.00 = $2.00 refund
* Final cost: $38.40 - $2.00 = $36.40

So, the person's gas will cost $36.40 after the refund.

110	Marcell and Beatrice compete to see who can eat the most scrolls of fruit, i.e., open as many scrolls as they can. Either way, one person makes a mistake - Beatrice eats 2 scrolls 24 inches wide and Marcell eats 3 scrolls 14 inches wide. If each eats his own portion, how much of the average portion did they eat?	45	"Ndi Igbo ka m bu! (That's ""Let's do it in Igbo!"" for you!)

Beatrice ate 2 scrolls of 24 inches each, so she ate a total of 2 x 24 = 48 inches.

Marcell ate 3 scrolls of 14 inches each, so he ate a total of 3 x 14 = 42 inches.

To find the average portion, we add their total inches and divide by 2: (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45 inches.

So, they ate an average of 45 inches of scrolls each.

111	Julia's boat hit a hole in the ocean. The boat was taking two liters of water for every 10 meters she drove to shore. It took her six seconds to reach two meters. The yacht was 64 seconds behind us. How much water had the boat taken by the time Julia reached shore?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Julia's boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 meters.
* It takes her 6 seconds to reach 2 meters, so to reach 10 meters, it will take her 6 x 5 = 30 seconds.
* Since the yacht is 64 seconds behind, Julia will reach shore in 30 seconds.
* To find out how much water the boat takes, divide 30 seconds by 30 seconds/10 meters = 1 liter/second.
* Multiply 1 liter/second by 30 seconds = 30 liters.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jamal's cell phone can store 1,800 photos.
2. Brittany's largest cell phone can store 50 times as many photos as Jamal's bird at the zoo. So, if Jamal's bird can store x photos, Brittany's phone can store 50x photos.
3. Jamal's cell phone can store 1,800 photos, and Brittany's phone can store 50 times as many photos as Jamal's bird. Since Jamal's cell phone can store 1,800 photos, and Brittany's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Jamal's phone, Brittany's phone can store 6 x 1,800 = 10,800 photos.
4. Now, we know Brittany's phone can store 50x photos, and we know it can store 10,800 photos. So, we can set up the equation: 50x = 10,800.
5. Divide both sides by 50 to get x = 216.

So, Jamal's bird at the zoo can store 216 photos.

115	Sasha discovers that the price of the wood has gone up by 50% since the last time she bought it, so she decides to sell some of it. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left that she bought for $10 each, and five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?	90	"Ndi Igbo, ""O di kwa aka!"" (That's good, let's do it!)

Let's calculate the cost price and selling price of each type of board:

**2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
Cost price = $10 each
Selling price = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
Profit per board = $15 - $10 = $5 each
Total profit from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $5 x 10 = $50

**4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
Cost price = $16 each
Selling price = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each
Profit per board = $24 - $16 = $8 each
Total profit from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $8 x 5 = $40

Total profit = $50 + $40 = $90

O di kwa aka! Sasha makes a profit of $90."

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 cars each, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 cars. 

The next day, the total number of cars became 30. To find the number of containers brought in, we'll subtract the initial number of cars from the new total: 30 - 10 = 20 cars. 

Since each container has 5 cars, we'll divide the new total by 5: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 containers. 

So, my friend, 4 containers were brought in the next day, each with 5 cars.

119	Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Over the next four years, her salary increased by 40 percent, more than it had been four years earlier. If Adrien's salary and Lylah's salary were the same, with Adrien receiving $40,000 four years earlier, how much would the two of them have earned in salary four years later?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years earlier. So, Lylah's salary four years earlier was:

$40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769

Now, Lylah's salary increased by 40% over the next four years. So, her new salary is:

$30,769 x 1.4 = $43,076

Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries are now the same, Adrien's salary is also $43,076.

To find their combined salary, we add their individual salaries:

$43,076 + $43,076 = $86,152

So, the two of them would have earned $86,152 in salary four years later.

129	The hospital treats 500 patients a day. Each patient is treated for a whopping 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these women?	10000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Each patient is treated for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so for each patient, it pays $150 x 0.4 = $60.

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so for each patient, it charges $200 x 0.4 = $80.

The profit per patient is $80 - $60 = $20.

(Translation: Nissa registered 60 seasonal workers at her shop in Santa. Then one-third of the workers quit after the children teased them, and then 10 quit after the children kicked their heads off. How many workers are left?)

Let's calculate:

60 (total workers) - 20 (one-third of 60) = 40
40 - 10 = 30

Translation: ""Ah ah! Okay! Pam and Fred went to the club, Pam rode a bicycle twice, Fred rode four times. Then, they both rode a chair twice. Now, if each chair had six tickets, how many tickets were used that day? 

Answer: Pam rode a bicycle twice and a chair twice, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode a bicycle four times and a chair twice, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. In total, they used 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each chair has 6 tickets, they used 2 chairs, which is 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. But wait, they also rode bicycles! Let's assume bicycles also have tickets, but we're not told how many. So, we can only answer for the chairs, which is 12 tickets."""
133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles; on Tuesday, he walked six times as many miles; and on Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles.	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles, so that's 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
On Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday alone, we subtract the miles from Monday and Tuesday: 41 - 24 - 4 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

Ukubonga: Tom uyathola izolo 4 zemali zamathokazi ngomzuzu. Izimali zamathokazi ziyizolo 15. Ngomnyaka, uTom uyathola izolo 4 * 12 = 48 zemali zamathokazi. Izimali zamathokazi ziyizolo 15, ngakho uTom uyathola izolo 48 * 15 = 720 izodwa ngomnyaka. (Answer: Tom gets 4 car loans per month. Each car loan is $15. In a year, Tom gets 4 * 12 = 48 car loans. Each car loan is $15, so Tom gets 48 * 15 = 720 dollars in a year.)

Let's break it down:

Brian had 20 video games initially, but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 games now.

Bobby has 3 times as many games as Brian, so Bobby has 3 × 15 = 45 games.

But wait, Bobby has 5 fewer games than 3 times as many as Brian, so we subtract 5: 45 - 5 = 40 games.

* One-third of 27 breeds are found in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 breeds.
* Two-thirds of 27 breeds are females, so that's 27 × 2/3 = 18 breeds.
* Since 9 breeds are found in the Scottish Highlands, and we want to know how many are native to Scotland, the answer is 9.

137	Rory ordered 2 sub at $7.50 each, 2 packets of chips at $1.50 each and 2 cookies at $1.00 each for delivery. There are 20 parts shipping charges added to the bill and he wants to add $5.00 as a deposit. How much will the total order including shipping cost be?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total order:

2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 packets of chips at $1.50 each = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total food cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Shipping charges = $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00 (including 20 parts shipping charges)
Deposit = $40.00 + $5.00 = $45.00

Total order including shipping cost = $45.00

Let's calculate:

For the first test, Mark completed 75 questions in 8 hours. His rate is 5 questions per hour, so he completed 5 x 8 = 40 questions. He had 75 - 40 = 35 questions left over.

For the second test, Mark completed 100 questions in 6 hours. His rate is 5 questions per hour, so he completed 5 x 6 = 30 questions. He had 100 - 30 = 70 questions left over.

In total, Mark had 35 + 70 = 105 questions left over.

In Yoruba, I'll respond: ""Mark ni awọn ẹṣẹ 105 ti o ku!"" (Mark had 105 questions left over!)"

141	There are about 700 bees in a hive, including more than twice as many worker bees as honeybees, and more than twice as many honeybees as honeybees.	400	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* There are more than twice as many worker bees as honeybees, so if we let honeybees be x, then worker bees are 2x.
* There are more than twice as many honeybees as drones, so if we let drones be y, then honeybees are 2y.
* Since honeybees are x and also 2y, we can set up the equation x = 2y.
* We know that the total number of bees is 700, and it's the sum of worker bees, honeybees, and drones. So, 2x + x + y/2 = 700 (since y/2 is the number of drones).
* Substitute x = 2y into the equation: 2(2y) + 2y + y/2 = 700.
* Simplify the equation: 9y = 700.
* Solve for y: y = 78.
* Now that we have y, we can find x and the number of worker bees: x = 2y = 156, and worker bees = 2x = 312.
* So, there are 78 drones, 156 honeybees, and 312 worker bees.

Let's calculate the cost of each item with the 10% tax:

* Milk ($2) - no tax, still $2
* Eggs ($3) - no tax, still $3
* Light bulbs ($3) - 10% tax = $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
* Cups ($3) - 10% tax = $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
* Towels ($4) - 10% tax = $4 + (10% of $4) = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

So, the items would cost: Milk $2, Eggs $3, Light bulbs $3.30, Cups $3.30, and Towels $4.40.

144	Kim starts her own housekeeping business and calculates how much profit she will make from her clients. She currently has 3 clients, but is in talks with 5 other clients and is confident enough to bring them together in her community. Each housekeeping family needs 2 bottles of bottled water and a pack of clean clothes. A bottle of bottled water will cost $2 each and a pack of clean clothes will cost $5 each. These are the only things she needs to spend money on. She calculates her average weekly income to be $2.9 The profit she has put into her housekeeping business plus the interest, so how much profit would that be, in dollars, per week, Lucas?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kim currently has 3 clients and is expecting to add 5 more, making a total of 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of water and 1 pack of clean clothes. So, the total cost of supplies per client is:
2 bottles of water x $2 each = $4
1 pack of clean clothes x $5 each = $5
Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

Since Kim has 8 clients, her total weekly expense is:
8 clients x $9 per client = $72

Kim's average weekly income is $2.9, so her profit per week is:
Profit = Income - Expense = $2.9 - $72 = $218

So, Kim's profit per week would be $218.

How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Each ball is 25 cents.
* On the first day, 5 people will cook for them in both balls, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 balls. 10 balls x 25 cents = 250 cents.
* 3 people will cook for them in all their balls, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 balls. 6 balls x 25 cents = 150 cents.
* Total cents = 250 cents + 150 cents = 400 cents.

How much faster is the winner than the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Blake runs 15 laps, and each lap is 100 yards, so he runs a total of:
15 laps x 100 yards/lap = 1500 yards

Kelly runs 1 lap, which is 100 yards, and then runs 40 yards back and forth 34 times. That's an additional:
34 x 40 yards = 1360 yards

So, Kelly runs a total of:
100 yards + 1360 yards = 1460 yards

To find out who runs faster, let's compare their distances:
Blake runs 1500 yards, and Kelly runs 1460 yards. That means Blake runs 1500 - 1460 = 40 yards more than Kelly.

So, Blake is the winner, and he is 40 yards faster than Kelly!

Now, let me do the math:

After 2 months: $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months: $34.56 + (20% of $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months: $41.47 + (20% of $41.47) = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months: $49.76 + (20% of $49.76) = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months: $59.71 + (20% of $59.71) = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months: $71.65 + (20% of $71.65) = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months: $85.98 + (20% of $85.98) = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months: $103.18 + (20% of $103.18) = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months: $123.82 + (20% of $123.82) = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months: $148.58 + (20% of $148.58) = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months: $178.30 + (20% of $178.30) = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months: $213.96 + (20% of $213.96) = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months: $256.75 + (20% of $256.75) = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
After 32 months: $308.10 + (20% of $308.10) = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
After 34 months: $369.72 + (20% of $369.72) = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
After 36 months: $443.66 + (20% of $443.66) = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

So, after 36 months, a bag of colored diamonds will cost approximately $532.39.

163	In the living room, there are 5 red toy cars, 3 toy soldiers, and 1 dollar. 1 dollar buys 3 toy soldiers and 1 red car buys $4. How much do all the toys cost if one toy soldier costs $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 dollar buys 3 toy soldiers, so 1 toy soldier costs $1/3.

We know 1 red car buys $4, so 5 red cars will buy $20.

Since 1 dollar buys 3 toy soldiers, $20 will buy 20 x 3 = 60 toy soldiers.

We have 3 toy soldiers, so we need 60 - 3 = 57 more toy soldiers.

Each toy soldier costs $5, so 57 toy soldiers will cost 57 x $5 = $285.

Adding the cost of the 5 red cars, which is $20, we get $285 + $20 = $305.

So, all the toys cost $305.

164	Jackie is trying to decide whether to work on her own taxes or hire an accountant. If she works on her own taxes, she will be able to do 3 hours of volunteer work, losing $35/hour in the time she spends without income. The accountant estimates $90. How much money would she have if she hired an accountant?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the answer in Zulu:

Umnikazi uJackie uyafisa ukuthola imali yakhe ngokuthenga umakhokeli wezimali. Uma ehamba ngokuthenga umakhokeli, uyothola imali engu-$90.

Uma uyakhetha ukuthenga ngokwakhe, uyothola ukuthola amahora athathu asebenza ngokuvolontiya, ebiza ngomakhokeli wamadola a-$35 ngosuku olungehliwe ngomuntu ngaphandle kwemali. Icala lale mali kuyindlela yokuthenga ngokwakhe ngu-$35 x 3 = $105.

Ngakho, uma uyakhetha ukuthenga umakhokeli, uyothola imali engu-$105 - $90 = $15.

Translation:

Jackie the worker wants to get her money by hiring an accountant. If she hires an accountant, she will get $90.

If she chooses to do it herself, she will get three hours of volunteer work, losing $35 per hour without income. The cost of doing it herself is $35 x 3 = $105.

So, if she chooses to hire an accountant, she will get $105 - $90 = $15."
165	For her 30th birthday, Elvina chooses a jewel-encrusted computer as a gift. She has a family budget of €1500 and thinks she will be able to save enough money to buy a dress. She goes to a computer store and chooses a €1090 device with a screen, keyboard and mouse. This also includes a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left over to buy her dress?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much money Elvina will have left over to buy her dress.

Elvina's family budget is €1500. She chooses a computer device that costs €1090. She also buys additional items: a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up the costs of these items:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her family budget:

€1500 (family budget) - €1423 (total cost) = €77

Elvina will have €77 left over to buy her dress.

To answer the question, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan, and she needs to make 15 flans. So, she needs 3 x 15 = 45 eggs. Her neighbor gave her 9 eggs, so she needs 45 / 9 = 5 times the number of eggs her neighbor gave her."

172	There are four birds on the train station. Which is Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice the age of Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, when Sally Thirthytwo is 8 years old, what is the total age of all four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is twice the age of Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.

Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:

Sally Four: 8 years old
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old
Granny Red: 16 years old
Two: 19 years old

The total age of all four birds is: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years old.

Let's break it down:

Jessica's lowest mortgage payment is $300 per month. She's willing to pay 50% more, which means she'll pay:

174	Billy cooks and slices almonds in preparation for making almond salads for an outdoor dinner to be served at a family gathering. It's a big event, so he has 60 almonds to use. All the almonds are about the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to cook and slice each one. Billy cooks the almonds in one and a half minutes, but it takes him 5 seconds to slice them. How long will it take to finish cooking the almonds?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Billy takes 1.5 minutes to cook each almond, and he has 60 almonds. To find the total time, we multiply the time per almond by the number of almonds:

1.5 minutes/almond × 60 almonds = 90 minutes

So, it will take Billy 90 minutes to finish cooking the almonds.

175	Juan and his brother, Carlos, sell lemon juice for $3 a can and $2 a can of sugar, and each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans. If they made $25 in profit, how much would they have spent on the lemon?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

They made $25 in profit, and each bottle sells for $0.50 for 20 cans, so they sold 20 x 0.50 = $10 worth of bottles.

They sell lemon juice for $3 a can and sugar for $2 a can. Let's assume they sold x cans of lemon juice and y cans of sugar.

The total cost would be 3x + 2y. The total revenue would be 10 (from bottles) + 3x + 2y.

Since they made $25 in profit, the revenue - cost = profit, so:

10 + 3x + 2y - (3x + 2y) = 25
10 = 25
This means they didn't make any profit from the bottles, and the $25 profit came from the lemon juice and sugar.

Let's assume they sold x cans of lemon juice and y cans of sugar. The profit from lemon juice is 3x, and the profit from sugar is 2y. Since the total profit is $25:

3x + 2y = 25

Now, we need to find the value of x (lemon juice). Let's try to eliminate y (sugar). Since the ratio of lemon juice to sugar is 3:2, let's assume y = (2/3)x.

Substitute y into the equation:

3x + 2((2/3)x) = 25
3x + (4/3)x = 25
(9x + 4x)/3 = 25
13x/3 = 25
13x = 75
x = 75/13
x = 5.77 (round up to 6, since you can't sell a fraction of a can)

They sold 6 cans of lemon juice. The cost of lemon juice is $3 a can, so they spent:

6 x 3 = $18

on lemon juice.

177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on gasoline, and the middle of the rest he gives to his loved ones. He gives his daughter $200 for his weekly expenses and his wife $700 for cooking and other household expenses. If Zaid lives on $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending on all of this and healing?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

He spends 1/4 on rent, which is $6000 x 1/4 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 on gasoline, which is $6000 x 1/3 = $2000.

So, he has spent $1500 + $2000 = $3500 so far.

He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He gives half of the remaining amount to his loved ones, which is $2500 x 1/2 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so he has given a total of $200 + $700 = $900 to his loved ones.

Now, he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

The question doesn't specify how much he spends on healing, so we can't determine the exact amount he'll have left. However, we can say he'll have $350 or less after spending on healing.

Rani has 10 more rabbits than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 rabbits.

184	Jerry rolls a six-way die. How many chances (expressed as a percentage) is he going to get on a number greater than 3 than if he rolls on two consecutive non-zero numbers?	25	"Ndi Igbo, ""O di kwa ukwu!"" (That's great!)

Let's break it down:

For a six-way die, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

To get a number greater than 3, Jerry has 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Now, let's consider rolling two consecutive non-zero numbers. The possible outcomes for the first roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. For the second roll, the possible outcomes are also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

To get two consecutive non-zero numbers, Jerry has 5 favorable outcomes for the first roll (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and 5 favorable outcomes for the second roll (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).

So, the probability of getting two consecutive non-zero numbers is (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36.

Now, let's convert this to a percentage: (25/36) × 100% ≈ 69.44%.

So, Jerry has a 69.44% chance of rolling two consecutive non-zero numbers.

In comparison, he has a 50% chance of rolling a number greater than 3. Therefore, he has a higher chance (by 19.44 percentage points) of rolling two consecutive non-zero numbers than rolling a number greater than 3.

186	Russell works at a small pet store and is distributing the seeds. The seeds are kept in 3 nets in equal groups and each net is given 6 seeds. There are 10 nets with hamster seeds separated and each hamster is given 5 seeds. There is also a red box containing 20 seeds. No seeds are used elsewhere in the store. If 160 seeds are divided into small seeds, how many seeds are in each net?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

* 3 nets with equal groups of seeds, each with 6 seeds, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 seeds.
* 10 nets with hamster seeds, each with 5 seeds, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 seeds.
* 1 red box with 20 seeds.

Total seeds = 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 seeds.

Now, 160 seeds are divided into small seeds, and we want to know how many seeds are in each net. Let's divide 160 by the total number of nets, which is 3 (small seeds) + 10 (hamster seeds) = 13 nets.

So, 160 ÷ 13 = 12.31 (but we can't have a fraction of a seed, so we'll round down to 12).

Therefore, there are 12 seeds in each net.

If the transportation of each sack from the field to the warehouse would be $2, if the merchant made a profit of $400 in total after selling all the sacks at $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Let's break it down in Twi, a Ghanaian language:

Now, let's calculate:

Let the number of sacks be x.

Cost price per sack = $20
Transportation cost per sack = $2
Total cost per sack = $20 + $2 = $22
Selling price per sack = $30
Total profit = $400

Since the merchant made a profit of $400, we can set up the equation:

(x × $30) - (x × $22) = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 50

So, the merchant sold 50 sacks of wheat!"
189	The three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets to a trade show. They spent $4.40 for a meal below the ticket price. They also traveled on 2 separate trips for $33 each. If they decided to split the total cost equally, how much would each of them have paid?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

3 tickets = $20.25
Meal = $4.40
Total so far = $20.25 + $4.40 = $24.65
2 trips = 2 x $33 = $66
Total cost = $24.65 + $66 = $90.65

To find out how much each friend would pay, we divide the total cost by 3:

$90.65 ÷ 3 = $30.22

So each friend would pay $30.22.

So, approximately 2.86 pounds of insects would be needed per day for a flock of 10 bats.

Year 3: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 66 + 10 - 2 = 74 trees.
Year 4: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 74 + 10 - 2 = 82 trees.
Year 5: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 82 + 10 - 2 = 90 trees.
Year 6: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 90 + 10 - 2 = 98 trees.
Year 7: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 98 + 10 - 2 = 106 trees.
Year 8: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 106 + 10 - 2 = 114 trees.
Year 9: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 114 + 10 - 2 = 122 trees.
Year 10: Tom plants 10 trees, cuts down 2, so he has 122 + 10 - 2 = 130 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees. So, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

Sawubona! (Hello!) Tom has 91 trees left."
193	On Friday morning, the neighbors placed the plastic flamingos in a pink tin can in Sue's front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned one-third of the flamingos and painted them white, replacing the flamingos they had left in Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added 18 pink plastic flamingos. By noon on Sunday, how many more pink flamingos were out there than white?	24	"Ndi Igbo, o di mma!

Let's break it down step by step:

On Friday, the neighbors placed some flamingos in Sue's yard. Let's call the number of flamingos ""x"".

On Saturday, they returned one-third of the flamingos, which is x/3. They painted them white and replaced the ones they left in Sue's yard. So, the number of white flamingos is x/3.

On Sunday, they added 18 pink flamingos. The total number of pink flamingos is now x - x/3 + 18.

To find the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

(x - x/3 + 18) - x/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2x/3 + 18 - x/3
= x/3 + 18

Since we don't know the initial value of x, we can't find the exact difference. However, we know that the difference is x/3 + 18.

In Igbo, we say ""Ka anyị dị iche iche!"" which means ""We have a difference!"""

195	A pencil costs the same as a pencil plus a pencil. A pencil costs $1.20 and a pencil costs $0.30. How much would 8 pencils cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. A pencil costs $1.20, and a pencil plus a pencil costs the same, so a pencil plus a pencil is also $1.20.

Now, if a pencil costs $0.30, then a pencil plus a pencil is $0.30 + $0.30 = $0.60.

Since a pencil costs $1.20 and a pencil plus a pencil costs $0.60, we can set up the equation:

$1.20 = $0.60

To find the cost of one pencil, we can divide both sides by 2:

$1.20 ÷ 2 = $0.60 ÷ 2
$0.60 = $0.30

So, one pencil costs $0.30.

Now, to find the cost of 8 pencils, we can multiply the cost of one pencil by 8:

$0.30 x 8 = $2.40

Therefore, 8 pencils would cost $2.40.

40 kilos × 2 pounds/kilo = 80 pounds

You have 200 pounds of carrots, and you'll use 80 pounds. To find out how many pounds won't be used:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Let's solve the problem:

Total population = 23,786
Farmers = 8,417
Women = 9,092
Total adults = Farmers + Women = 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509
Children = Total population - Total adults = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277

198	At the end of the month, Elaine collected three times as many Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: Elaine collected x Pokémon cards.
Month 2: She collected 3x Pokémon cards (three times as many as in Month 1).
Month 2: She collected 3x - 20 Pokémon cards (20 fewer than in Month 1).
Month 3: She collected 2(x + 3x - 20) = 2(4x - 20) Pokémon cards (twice as many as in Month 1 and 2).

Total Pokémon cards = x + (3x - 20) + 2(4x - 20)
= x + 3x - 20 + 8x - 40
= 12x - 60

Now, let's find x. Since Month 2 is 20 fewer than Month 1, we can set up the equation:
3x - 20 = x
2x = 20
x = 10

Now, substitute x into the total:
12x - 60 = 12(10) - 60
= 120 - 60
= 60

Elaine now has 60 Pokémon cards in total!

199	Mark is a lawyer. He writes the same number of sentences per week for two different publishers, each paying him a different amount per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark writes 1,000 cents per week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make per week, calculated in cents?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mark ukhuluma amakhosi amabili (Mark writes two publishers)
Akhuluma amakhosi amabili ngokufanayo (He writes the same number of sentences for both)
Umshumeli B uyamthenga amadola amabili kangaka umshumeli A (Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A)
Mark ukhuluma izinhlelo eziyi-1,000 (Mark writes 1,000 cents per week)
Umshumeli A uyamthenga izinhlelo eziyi-5 (Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence)

Let's calculate:

Mark writes 1,000 cents per week. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark writes 1,000 / 5 = 200 sentences per week.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much, Mark earns 5 x 2 = 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.

Total earnings per week = (200 sentences x 5 cents) + (200 sentences x 10 cents) = 1,000 cents + 2,000 cents = 3,000 cents.

Let's break it down:

Original salary (unknown) + 5% increase = New salary
New salary x 2000 hours = Total salary for the year
Total salary + $5000 (one-time payment) = Total earnings for the year

Let's assume his original salary is x.
New salary = x + (5% of x) = x + 0.05x = 1.05x

Since he works 2000 hours a year, his total salary for the year is:
1.05x × 2000 = 2100x

Adding the one-time payment of $5000:
2100x + 5000 = Total earnings for the year

To find the total earnings, we need to know his original salary (x). If you provide that, I can give you the exact total earnings for the year.

210	Sara wants to buy a new jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the pair of shoes $20. Sara raises her neighbor's children four times, each time earning $5. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass in the yard. If Sarah had saved $10 before she started raising children, how many times would she have to cut the grass in the yard to get a jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkolelo yakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $20 for the shoes, so she needs a total of $50.

She earns $5 each time she raises her neighbor's children, and she does it 4 times, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20.

She already had $10 saved, so she now has $20 + $10 = $30.

She still needs $50 - $30 = $20 more.

Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass. To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass, we divide the amount she still needs ($20) by the amount she earns each time ($4):

$20 ÷ $4 = 5

So, Sara needs to cut the grass 5 times to get the jacket and shoes.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Sara kufanele akhulele ibhadi 5 ukuthola ijeketile nezipho."" (Sara needs to cut the grass 5 times to get the jacket and shoes.)"
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. Doesn't he have two more white chickens than the red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izinhlanzi ezimnyama ziyaphuma amaqiniso angu-3 ngosuku, izinhlanzi ezimhlophe ziyaphuma amaqiniso angu-5 ngosuku. UJerry uyaphuqa amaqiniso angu-42 ngosuku. Uma unezinhlanzi ezimhlophe ezisingeyi ezinhlanzi ezimnyama, inzinhlanzi ezimnyama eziyini?

Let's use algebra to solve this:

Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.

We know W = R + 2 (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substitute W = R + 2 into the equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expand and simplify:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide by 8:

R = 4

So, UJerry unezinhlanzi ezimnyama ezi-4. (Jerry has 4 red chickens.)"

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, each with a capacity of 15,146 gallons per minute.* Four minutes ago, the larger pool held twice as much water as the smaller pool; now the larger pool holds four times as much water as the smaller pool.	8	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the amount of water in the smaller pool four minutes ago be x.

Since the larger pool held twice as much water as the smaller pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the larger pool four minutes ago was 2x.

Now, the amount of water in the smaller pool currently is x + 4(15,146), since it's been four minutes and each pool can hold 15,146 gallons per minute.

The amount of water in the larger pool currently is 2x + 4(15,146), since it's also been four minutes.

We're told that the larger pool currently holds four times as much water as the smaller pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(15,146) = 4(x + 4(15,146))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 60,584 = 4x + 60,584

Subtracting 60,584 from both sides gives us:

2x = 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

0 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

0 = x

So, the smaller pool had 0 gallons of water four minutes ago. Since each pool can hold 15,146 gallons per minute, the smaller pool currently has:

0 + 4(15,146) = 60,584 gallons

And the larger pool currently has:

4(60,584) = 242,336 gallons

219	Four students scored a total of 251 points by playing a game of cards. Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Jojo scored how many points?	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points are 251. Let's add up Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's points: 68 + 78 + 85 = 231.

To find Jojo's points, subtract the total points from the sum of the other three: 251 - 231 = 20 points.

Jojo scored 20 points!

(Uh, let me calculate that for you... 

Ithongo: 3 x 10 = 30 amazuzu
Isudoku: 8 x 5 = 40 amazuzu

221	A water tank filled with 120 liters of water Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her farm. Later she was able to collect twice as much rainwater as she had left over. How many liters of water is in the tank now?	90	"""Odi nkeji iri na asatọ!"" (That's Igbo for ""There are 150 liters!"")

Here's the calculation:

Celine had 120 liters initially and used 90 liters, leaving her with 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

She collected twice as much rainwater as she had left over, which is 2 x 30 = 60 liters.

So, she now has 30 liters (leftover) + 60 liters (rainwater) = 90 liters in the tank."

Let's break it down:

Year 1: The company spends $15,000.
Year 2: The company spends a third of $15,000, which is $15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000.

Total spend over two years = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

224	Carlos rents a small boat for $30 an hour and Benji rents a full-sized boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos rents a boat for 3 hours and Benji rents a canoe for 5 hours, how much will the two of them together pay?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount they will pay:

Carlos rents a small boat for $30 an hour and rents it for 3 hours, so he will pay:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a full-sized boat for $18 an hour and rents it for 5 hours, so he will pay:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Together, they will pay:
$90 + $90 = $180

225	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 green cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 of the water cards and buys 14 of the green cards, what are the odds (numbered to the nearest whole number) that the most likely card will be the water card?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the cards:

Fire cards: 30
Green cards: 20 + 14 = 34
Water cards: 40 - 8 = 32

The most likely card is the green card. To find the odds, we can divide the number of green cards by the total number of cards:

34 (green cards) / 86 (total cards) = 0.395

Multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

0.395 x 100 = 39.5%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the odds are approximately 40%.

226	Chad ordered one burrito for lunch. The low-end burrito is $6.50. He adds another steak for $2.00, another cheese for $1.00, a sandwich for $1.00 and a double soup for $0.25 each. He decides to add to his meal an additional $3.00 that will buy chips and drinks. He has a debit card for $5.00 that he uses to pay. How much does he owe?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

* Burrito: $6.50
* Steak: $2.00
* Cheese: $1.00
* Sandwich: $1.00
* Double soup: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
* Chips and drinks: $3.00
* Total: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad pays with a $5.00 debit card, so he owes:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Chad owes $9.00."
227	Calinda works on a 360-degree rotor with her mother. Under normal conditions, Calinda can add up to 4 parts per minute. Calinda's mother can add up as many parts per minute as she can by dividing Calinda's parts in half. How many hours will it take them to complete the rotor?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukudla kwabo kuya ngani?""

Now, let's solve the problem. Calinda adds 4 parts per minute, and her mother adds half of that, which is 2 parts per minute. Together, they add 4 + 2 = 6 parts per minute.

Since there are 360 degrees, we can assume there are 360 parts to complete the rotor. To find the time it takes to complete the rotor, we divide the total parts by the number of parts added per minute:

360 parts ÷ 6 parts/minute = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take them 60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour to complete the rotor.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kuyafana ukuthi bazokwenza le rotor ngomzuzu omnyama!"" (It will take them one hour to complete the rotor!)"
228	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30 percent of the melons were ripe, which she took home. When she returned two weeks later, three quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, which she harvested. How many melons were not ripe two weeks later?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the melons ripe, which means 70% were not ripe.

When she returned two weeks later, three quarters (3/4) of the remaining melons were ripe. This means 1/4 of the remaining melons were not ripe.

Let's assume there were 100 melons initially. Then, 30% of 100 = 30 melons were ripe, leaving 100 - 30 = 70 melons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 70 melons were ripe, which is (3/4) × 70 = 52.5 melons (let's round up to 53 melons).

This means 70 - 53 = 17 melons were not ripe two weeks later.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingu-17 ezazinakile emva kweminyaka emibili."" (There were 17 unripe melons two weeks later.)"
229	Mark buys his company a fleet of 12 cars. Each car costs $20,000. He paid 10% interest on the cars and paid $1000 to register each of them. How much does he pay for each one?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of each car = $20,000
Interest = 10% of $20,000 = $2,000
Registration fee = $1,000
Total cost per car = $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $23,000

230	On Mondays, Kylie collects five times as many fish as Robert does - 20! On Tuesdays, Kylie collects twice as many fish as he collects at the beaches!	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Mondays, Kylie collects 5 times as many fish as Robert, minus 20. If Robert collects x fish, Kylie collects 5x - 20.

On Tuesdays, Kylie collects twice as many fish as she collects at the beaches. Since we don't know the exact number, let's say she collects 2(5x - 20) fish.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kylie ucala amafishi angu-5x-20 ekuseni, futhi ucala amafishi angu-2(5x-20) emini!"" (Kylie collects 5x-20 fish on Mondays, and 2(5x-20) fish on Tuesdays!)"

233	Steve decides to start eating more peanuts and grows more cherries. He eats twice as many peanuts as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a root produces 3 peanuts a week, how many peanuts does he need?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Steve eats 6 peanuts a day, and he eats twice as many as his girlfriend. So, his girlfriend eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 peanuts a day.

Since Steve eats 6 peanuts a day, in a week (7 days), he'll eat 6 × 7 = 42 peanuts.

If a root produces 3 peanuts a week, Steve needs 42 ÷ 3 = 14 roots to produce the peanuts he needs.

237	Mary is two years older than Joan, but Joan is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the average age of the three girls?	90	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jessa is 20 years old.
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is 2 years older than Joan, so Mary is 25 + 2 = 27 years old.

The average age of the three girls is (20 + 25 + 27) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 years old.

238	The number of students in a classroom was 1000. The classroom had 3 entrances A, B and C as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students left the building through door A, 3/5 left through door B and the rest left through door C, count the number of students who left through door C.	68	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

30% of 1000 students left through door A, which is:
1000 x 0.3 = 300 students

3/5 of 1000 students left through door B, which is:
1000 x (3/5) = 600 students

Now, let's find the number of students who left through door C:
1000 - (300 + 600) = 100 students

So, 100 students left through door C.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezinhlanu ezithoba ukuphuma ngishayeli C."" (There are 100 students who left through door C.)"

John has 54 candles, and he has twice as many as Robert. So, Robert has half of 54, which is 27.

James has 6 more candles than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candles.

Now, let's find out how many more candles John has than James: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candles than James.

241	Mike's friendships with people of other races were cut short when he lost two of them. Each of them sends two letters a week, each letter about five feet long. He writes a letter again and again. He can write a whole chapter every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing?	6	"Nkɔnkɔɔ! (Ahaha!) Okay, let me calculate for you.

Each friend sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 feet long (which doesn't make sense, but let's go with it!). Mike writes a letter again and again, so that means he writes 2 letters per friend, per week. That's 4 letters per week.

Now, he can write a whole chapter every 6 minutes. Let's assume a chapter is roughly 5-10 pages. If he writes 4 letters per week, that's approximately 20-40 pages per week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. If he writes a chapter every 6 minutes, that means he writes 10 chapters per hour (60 minutes ÷ 6 minutes per chapter).

Now, let's convert the number of pages he writes per week to hours. Assuming 30 pages per week (a rough estimate), and 10 chapters per hour, that means he writes approximately 3 hours per week.

So, Mike spends around 3 hours per week writing."
242	Jason had a 1,000-minute-a-month phone schedule: 15 minutes a day on the phone with his boss, and 300 extra minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if the month has 30 days?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jason has 1000 minutes in total.
He spends 15 minutes a day on the phone with his boss for 30 days, so that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.
He also has 300 extra minutes to call other people.

To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we subtract the minutes he's already used from the total:

1000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left.

243	Griffin had 24 French fries, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a slice of his fries, and Colby gave Griffin a slice three times as big as Kyle's.	250	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 French fries initially.

Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 left.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 x 5 = 10.

Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 left.

Ginger gave Griffin a slice of his fries, which means Ginger gave 1.

Colby gave Griffin a slice three times as big as Kyle's, which means Colby gave 3 x 5 = 15.

So, Griffin now has 9 + 1 + 15 = 25 French fries.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Griffin una-25 amafrench fries manje!"" (Griffin has 25 French fries now!)"
244	There are 4 algae in one pond and 32 algae in the other. The difference in the number of algae in the two ponds is twice the number of fish in the two ponds. If the two ponds have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each pond?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The difference in the number of algae is 32 - 4 = 28. This difference is twice the number of fish. So, the number of fish is 28 ÷ 2 = 14. Since the two ponds have the same number of fish, each pond has 14 ÷ 2 = 7 fish.

245	Jean's employer charges her $250 per hour. She needs expensive makeup for her film and takes 6 hours of work a day 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete. Then when the film is finished, Jean's employer gives her 10% of the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. That's a total of:

6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

She earns $250 per hour, so her total earnings are:

120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

Her employer gives her 10% of the amount of work done, which is:

$30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000

So, Jean earns a total of $30,000 and gets a bonus of $3,000. To find out how much she pays, we need to subtract the bonus from her total earnings:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean pays $27,000 for the makeup.
