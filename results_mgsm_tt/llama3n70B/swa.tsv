0	Janet's duck lays 16 eggs a day. She eats three at breakfast every morning and bakes her duck friends four eggs a day. She sells the rest at the farmers' market every day for $2 per duck egg. How much money does she make in dollars a day at the farmers' market?	18	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Janet's duck lays 16 eggs a day.
She eats 3 eggs at breakfast, leaving 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
She bakes 4 eggs for her duck friends, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18 per day.

Ukuthula, Janet uyaphumelela $18 ngosuku! (That's it, Janet makes $18 a day!)"
1	A gown uses 2 cords of blue thread and half that amount of white thread. How many cords does it use altogether?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi ingxenye yethredhi ewhite yi-half ye-2, okuthiwa yi-1. Ngakho, ithredhi liyafana nalena yi-2 + 1 = yi-3. (I want to find that the part of white thread is half of 2, which is 1. So, the threads are equal to this 2 + 1 = 3.)

Ugown uyasebenzisa amacordi athu! (The gown uses 3 cords!)"
2	Josha decides to try to buy the house and sell it at a profit. He buys the house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $80,000
Renovation cost = $50,000
Total investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The renovation increased the value by 150%, so the new value is:
$80,000 x 2.5 (1 + 1.5) = $200,000

Selling price = $200,000
Profit = Selling price - Total investment = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Umsebenzi wam! (Good work!) Josha made a profit of $70,000!"

4	Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of chicken food, a mixture of seeds, insects, and vegetables to help maintain their good health. She feeds the chickens their food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to give her chickens at the last meal of the day if Wendi's chickens number 20?	20	"""Odi nke anyi ga-eri na Wendi ga-enye ichekwa ya na ichekwa ndi otu iteonye na iteonye na iteonye.

Translation: ""She will give them 30 cups at the last meal."""
5	Kylar went to the store to buy mirrors for her new building. One mirror costs $5, but each second mirror costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 mirrors. How much does she have to pay for those mirrors?	64	"Ewe: ""Mirɔɔ awuietɔ 16, kɔtɔ ɖe kɔtɔ 5, kɔtɔ ɖe kɔtɔ 5 * 0.6, kɔtɔ ɖe kɔtɔ 5 * 0.6 * 0.6,..., kɔtɔ ɖe kɔtɔ 5 * 0.6^7.

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Adding them up, we get: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB every minute, but at 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to load updates, and it takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start downloading again from the beginning. How long will it take her to download the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so to download 200 GB, it would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, at 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart. 40% of 200 GB is:

200 GB × 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla downloads 80 GB in:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

Then, the restart takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start downloading again from the beginning. This means she needs to download the entire 200 GB again.

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

Adding the time it took to download 80 GB, the restart time, and the time to download the entire file again, we get:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

Therefore, it will take Carla 160 minutes to download the file.

Siyabonga! (Thank you!)"
8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour and then turns around because he realizes that he has forgotten something very important at home. He tries to get home for 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in traffic. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. What is the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he covers a distance of:
3 hours x 60 miles/hour = 180 miles

Then, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't move. After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
0.5 hours x 30 miles/hour = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for 4 hours at 80 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
4 hours x 80 miles/hour = 320 miles

Now, let's add up the distances to find out how far he is from home:
180 miles - 15 miles - 320 miles = -155 miles

Since distance can't be negative, we take the absolute value:
|-155 miles| = 155 miles

So, John is 155 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives 1.2 times her regular hourly overtime pay. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her weekly earnings?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi (Let me calculate)...

Eliza's regular pay for 40 hours = 40 hours x $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay for 5 hours = 5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60

Weekly earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Ukuthula, Eliza's weekly earnings are $460! (That's it, Eliza's weekly earnings are $460!)"
10	A new app was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but fell by 30% in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in total during the three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: 60 downloads
 Month 2: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
 Month 3: 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Total downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of biscuits: 3 dozen doughnuts for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen cupcakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen cupcakes for $55 a dozen.	694	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

3 dozen doughnuts = 3 x $68 = $204
2 dozen cupcakes = 2 x $80 = $160
6 dozen cupcakes = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. It will cost $90 to plant it. Each year it will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of watering and feeding the tree each year is $3. How many years will it take before he starts to make a profit from the lemon?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit Carlos will make each year:

7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year (revenue)
-$3/year (cost of watering and feeding) = $7.5/year (net profit)

Since Carlos invested $90 initially, he needs to cover that cost before making a profit. To find the break-even point, divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 ÷ $7.5/year = 12 years

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
13	Melanie is a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, 2 more in the red house, and half of the rest in the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners in the green house. This means she had 3x vacuum cleaners initially, where x is the number sold in the green house.

She sold 2 more in the red house, so she sold x + 2 vacuum cleaners in total.

She had half of the rest left, which means she had 3x - (x + 2) = 2x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of the rest in the orange house, which means she had (2x - 2)/2 = x - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

But we know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so x - 1 = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 6.

Since Melanie had 3x vacuum cleaners initially, she had 3(6) = 18 vacuum cleaners initially.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% of the rest enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in brass dance. What percentage of all students enrolled in brass dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 students enrolled in modern dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.

So, the number of students who enrolled in brass dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage, divide the number of students who enrolled in brass dance by the total number of students, and multiply by 100:

(12 ÷ 20) x 100 = 60%

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) The answer is 60%."
15	A trader wants to make a purchase choice between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will rise to 2.5% while the electronics market will rise to 1.2% within the same month. If the trader wants to have the highest profits by the end of this month by making an option, how much profit will this be?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = Principal x Rate of Return
= $5,000 x 2.5%
= $5,000 x 0.025
= $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Profit = Principal x Rate of Return
= $8,000 x 1.2%
= $8,000 x 0.012
= $96

The trader will make a higher profit by choosing the jewelry option, with a profit of $125.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuba ungowethu, ungakwazi ukuthola inzuzo ebalulekile ngokuchotha izicathulo, kufanele aqhakaze ngoku$125."" (If you want to make a good profit, you should choose the jewelry option, which will give you a profit of $125.)"
16	Two trains have left San Rafael at the same time. They have started traveling westward, both traveling 80 miles. The next day, they travel northward, 150 miles. What is the distance the two trains traveled in the two days?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour to coach and $30 an hour to coach the fans. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, Jill works 35 hours/week and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works a total of:
35 hours/week x 50 weeks = 1750 hours/year

Her hourly rate as a teacher is $20, so her annual salary as a teacher is:
1750 hours/year x $20/hour = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill works 15 hours/week and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works a total of:
15 hours/week x 50 weeks = 750 hours/year

Her hourly rate as a coach is $30, so her annual salary as a coach is:
750 hours/year x $30/hour = $22,500/year

Her total annual salary is:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

18	Claire prepares 3 almond eggs every morning during the feast. How many dozen eggs will she eat after 4 weeks?	7	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukudla kwakhe kungaba 3 amaqiniso angamafutha ngosuku olune. Emva kwamasonto amane, uzothola iziqiniso eziyi-... (Let me calculate)... 12 iziqiniso eziyi-3 = 36 iziqiniso. Emva kwamasonto amane, uzothola iziqiniso eziyi-36 x 7 = 252 iziqiniso. Ukudla kwakhe kungaba iziqiniso eziyi-21 dozen.""

In English, that means: ""She eats 3 almond eggs every morning. After 4 weeks, she will eat... (Let me calculate)... 12 eggs x 3 = 36 eggs. After 4 weeks, she will eat 36 eggs x 7 = 252 eggs. She will eat 21 dozen eggs."""
19	Marissa walks a distance of 12 miles [12 km]. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Marissa wabhodwa izindlela eziyi-12 miles. Wakhokha imini eyodwa ukuthuthuka izindlela eziyi-4 miles, kusho imini eyodwa ukuthuthuka izindlela eziyi-2 miles. Uma ufuna ukuthi isivumo sakhe siyi-4 miles per hour, kutheni isivumo esingakanani (in miles per hour) esingakafinyelela ukuthuthuka izindlela eziyethu?

(Translation: Marissa walked a distance of 12 miles. She took one hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?)

Let's calculate:

Time taken so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
Distance covered so far = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

To get an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in:

Time = Total distance / Average speed
= 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
= 3 hours

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles.

Speed needed = Remaining distance / Time left
= 6 miles / 1 hour
= 6 miles per hour

Kutheni, Marissa ingakafinyelela ukuthuthuka izindlela eziyi-6 miles per hour ukuthola isivumo sakhe siyi-4 miles per hour! (Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at 6 miles per hour to get an average speed of 4 miles per hour!)"
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water and I would prefer to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three thirds water. But when I pour it, I have poured out one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Orange juice: 10 liters, 2/3 water = 10 x 2/3 = 6.67 liters of water (approximately)
You poured out 1 liter, so remaining orange juice = 10 - 1 = 9 liters
Remaining water in orange juice = 6.67 - (1 x 2/3) = 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 liters (approximately)

Pineapple juice: 15 liters, 3/3 water = 15 liters of water (it's all water!)

Total remaining mixture = 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters
Total water in the mixture = 6 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 21 liters

So, there are 21 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of juice mixture.

Ngubani ukuthola? (How's that?)"
21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.

Raymond had a son at 23, so we need to find the difference between his current age and the age when he had a son: 37 - 23 = 14.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umfana kaRaymond wazalwa iminyaka engu-14 edlule."" (Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.)"
22	Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each. His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola inani lezinhlelo zokudla zabaBilly kuTuesday. (I want to calculate the number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday.)

Izicelo zakhe zokuqala ezintathu zakhetha izinhlelo zokudla ezinhlanu. (His first three customers bought one DVD each.)
3 x 1 = 3

Izicelo zakhe ezimbili ezalandelayo zakhetha izinhlelo zokudla ezimbili ngakubo. (His next two customers bought two DVDs each.)
2 x 2 = 4

Izicelo zakhe ezintathu ezilandelayo azikhethi izinhlelo zokudla. (His last three customers did not buy any DVDs.)
0 x 3 = 0

Ngithola ukuthi Billy wathola izinhlelo zokudla eziyisithupha kuTuesday. (I calculate that Billy sold six DVDs on Tuesday.)
3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Ukuthola ukuthi Billy wathola izinhlelo zokudla eziyisithupha kuTuesday. (I calculate that Billy sold seven DVDs on Tuesday.)"

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is after receiving a 25% discount on the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price of the book.

If Kyle received a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price.

Let's call the original price ""x"".

Since Kyle paid 75% of the original price, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 ÷ 0.75
x = 26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

25	Marie ordered one chicken meal for $12, 5 milk cartons for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Marie's order:

* 1 chicken meal = $12
* 5 milk cartons = 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples = 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total cost of above items = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
* Marie paid a total of $50, so she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on pizza
* Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza

26	Mishka bought 3 pairs of caps, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. A pair of caps is $16.50. A pair of pants is $22.50 and a pair of shoes is $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all the items of clothing he bought?	243	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

3 pairs of caps = 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
3 pairs of pants = 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
3 pairs of shoes = 3 x $42 = $126

Total amount = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the items of clothing he bought.

29	Gloria buys when she comes across a pair of shoes that fits her budget. However, she must choose between those shoes and two pairs of high-heeled shoes that together cost less than the cost of the shoes by five dollars. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33 and the other costs twice as much as the first pair, what is the price of the shoes?	104	"Odiro ki? (What's the problem?)

Let's break it down:

One pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it's $33 x 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is $33 + $66 = $99.

The shoes that fit Gloria's budget cost $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes. So, the price of the shoes is $99 + $5 = $104.

In Yoruba: Owo ọkọọkan Gloria ni $104. (Gloria's shoes cost $104.)"
30	The ages of Darrel and Allen are in the ratio 7:11. If the sum of their present ages is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

I-Darrel ne-Allen bayakhuluma ngokuthula 7:11. Uma ukuphakama kwabo kukhona 162, ngicela ukubonga ukuphakama kwa-Allen eminyakeni eyi-10 ezayo.

Now, let's solve the problem:

Let Darrel's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x.

We know that their sum is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now, find Allen's age:

Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

Ten years from now, Allen's age will be:

99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

31	Gunter tries to count the candies in the big bottle. He asks his friends how many candies they think are in the big bottle. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of what the first said. The third says 25% more than the first. What is their average estimate?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25/100) × 80 = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

So, their average estimate is 80.

32	John cares for 10 dogs, each of which he spends .5 hours a day walking and handling. How many hours a week does he spend caring for them?	35	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Okubonga ukuthi John uyalusa izinsuku eziyi-10, kanti kukhona isikhathi esingama-0.5 esihora ngosuku lokuhamba nokuthenga. Kuthatha isikhathi esingaki ngeweeki? (That's the question in isiZulu, a South African language)

Let's calculate: 10 dogs × 0.5 hours/day = 5 hours/day. In a week, there are 7 days, so 5 hours/day × 7 days = 35 hours/week.

Ukuthula, John uyathatha isikhathi esingama-35 ngeweeki ukulusa izinsuku zakhe! (That's the answer in isiZulu, which means ""John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs!"")"
33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 gold coins more than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Gretchen una-mali angu-110. (Gretchen has 110 coins.)
Kune-zigodi ezinhlanu ngaphezulu kwemali esiliva. (There are 30 gold coins more than silver coins.)

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. The number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

Gretchen una-mali ezigodi angu-70. (Gretchen has 70 gold coins.)"

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more, which means he scores 4 + (25% of 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry drinks 2 milkshakes. There is currently an offer of 4 milkshakes for $5.00. How much does he spend on milkshakes over a 30-day period?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry drinks 2 milkshakes a day, and there's an offer of 4 milkshakes for $5.00. To find out how much he spends on milkshakes per day, we need to calculate the cost of 2 milkshakes.

Since 4 milkshakes cost $5.00, 1 milkshake costs $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25. So, 2 milkshakes cost 2 × $1.25 = $2.50 per day.

Over a 30-day period, Terry spends $2.50 × 30 = $75.00 on milkshakes.

In isiZulu, that's ""Impofu yakhe iyakhokha $75.00 emenyweni eyi-30."" (He spends $75.00 in 30 days.)"
37	John plans to sell all his dolls and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 sets of Legos and sells them for $15 each. He manages to buy 8 video games for $20 each and is left with $5. How many Legos does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 sets of Legos for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He's left with:
$195 - $160 = $35

But the problem says he's left with $5, so there must be some mistake! It seems the problem is incorrect.

However, if we assume the problem means he's left with $5 after buying the video games, then he didn't use all the money from selling the Legos. He used $195 - $5 = $190 to buy the video games.

In that case, he didn't sell any Legos, so he still has all 13 sets of Legos!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs three days a week. He runs three hours the first day and half that amount the next two days he runs. How fast does he run?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week.

Day 1: He runs 3 hours. Let's assume his speed is x miles per hour.
He runs 3x miles on Day 1.

Day 2 and 3: He runs half the amount of Day 1, which is 1.5 hours each day.
He runs 1.5x miles on each of Day 2 and 3.

Total miles run in a week = 3x + 1.5x + 1.5x = 60 miles

Combine like terms: 6x = 60 miles

Divide by 6: x = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
39	Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump only half as fast. If she can jump three miles an hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends a third of an hour running and two thirds of an hour walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* She can jump 3 miles an hour, and she can walk twice as fast as she can jump, so she can walk 3 x 2 = 6 miles an hour.
* She can run four times as fast as she can walk, so she can run 6 x 4 = 24 miles an hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours:

* She spends 1/3 of an hour running, which is 2 hours. In 2 hours, she can run 24 x 2 = 48 miles.
* She spends 2/3 of an hour walking, which is 4 hours. In 4 hours, she can walk 6 x 4 = 24 miles.

In total, she can travel 48 + 24 = 72 miles in 6 hours.

Let's break it down:

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.

41	The giant ape, Perg, lived on the highest point of Mount Farbo, most aggressive to anything within 1,000 feet. Polly was able to throw a golden spear, the only known weapon capable of reaching the ape, 400 feet, well within range of the ape's rays. But when Polly caught the jewel, she was able to throw the spear three times as far as when she was not holding the jewel. Holding the jewel, how far beyond the ape's rays would Polly stand and still be able to hit the ape with the golden spear?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Polly was able to throw the spear 400 feet without the jewel. With the jewel, she could throw it three times as far, which is 400 x 3 = 1200 feet.

The ape's range is 1000 feet. To find out how far beyond the ape's range Polly can stand, we subtract the ape's range from the distance Polly can throw the spear with the jewel: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet beyond the ape's range and still hit the ape with the golden spear.

42	Mrs. Jones baked five apple cakes for the fireman's chamcha. She cut each cake into eight pieces and placed five cakes on the catering table for the guests to pick up. By the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces, there were 14 pieces of cake left over. How many pieces did the guests eat?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the pieces of cake, my friend. Mrs. Jones cut 5 cakes into 8 pieces each, so that's 5 x 8 = 40 pieces. After the evening, 14 pieces were left, so the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.

43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300 - gram bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you have already eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how many calories you have left for the day: 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, you can have: 200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300-gram bag has 5 servings, one serving is: 300 ÷ 5 = 60 grams.

So, you can eat: 0.8 × 60 = 48 grams of chips.

On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of sticker sheets; at work, she put one sticker catalogue in 220 different coffee cups. If she had 23 sticker sheets left in total, how many sticker sheets were in the package she bought?)

Let's calculate:

Candice had 80 sticker sheets initially.
She put 1 sticker catalogue in 220 coffee cups, so she used 220 sticker sheets.
She had 23 sticker sheets left, so she used a total of 80 - 23 = 57 sticker sheets.
Since she used 220 sticker sheets, the package she bought must have had 220 - 57 = 163 sticker sheets.

He spent on red ties:

10 x $60 = $600

In total, John spent:

The mechanic earned the most on Thursday, which is $520. To find the extra income, subtract Friday's earnings from Thursday's:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the extra income the mechanic earned on the day he earned the most is $40.

Total oranges that are not good = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges

So, the number of good oranges = 25 - 8 = 17 oranges

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"
61	Janet buys her daughter a bra. She pays $500 for the fabric to make it and then another $800 to the jeweler to make it. After that, she pays 10% of that to insure it. How much did she pay in total?	1430	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet pays $500 for the fabric and $800 to the jeweler, so she pays a total of $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then, she pays 10% of $1300 to insure it, which is $1300 x 0.1 = $130.

So, Janet pays a total of $1300 + $130 = $1430.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""UJanet uyaphatha izimali eziyizigidi ezinhlanu namakhulu amane"" (Janet paid a total of R1430).

Hope that helps!"
62	If Mercy works for the same company for 40 years, she will receive an annual pension of $50,000 a year. Starting after 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension annually. If she retires after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Izincwadi zithi: (The calculations say:)
5% of $50,000 = $2,500
$2,500 x 10 years = $25,000
Annual pension after 30 years = $50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000

Ukubonga kwakhe kwonyaka kuya ku-$25,000. (Her annual pension will be $25,000.)"
63	Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 a month. If the streaming company charged her that initial rate for the first half of the year and then charged her a reduced rate of 10% for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.	1596	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140/month, so:
6 months × $140 = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the rate was reduced by 10%, so:
$140 × 0.9 = $126/month
6 months × $126 = $756

Total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service at the end of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1,596

64	Sophia is considering taking a trip in her own car, and she would like to know how far she can travel on one tank of gasoline. She has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to fill her tank again. Her car's manual says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophia drive on one tank of gasoline?	300	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking! In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukubonga kakhulu!"" (You're welcome!)

Now, let's calculate how far Sophia can travel on one tank of gasoline.

Since Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons and she needs to add 4 gallons to fill it up, that means she has used 12 - 4 = 8 gallons to travel 100 miles.

To find out how far she can travel on one tank (12 gallons), we can set up a proportion:

(100 miles) / (8 gallons) = (x miles) / (12 gallons)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

100 × 12 = 8 × x
1200 = 8x
x = 1200 ÷ 8
x = 150 miles

So, Sophia can drive 150 miles on one tank of gasoline.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uma ukuthola igesi eliwodwa, uSophia uyakhulula izimoto ezinhlanu nezinkulungwane!"" (When she has a full tank, Sophia can travel 150 miles!)"
65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and read a book for half that time. He does this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading a book in four weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half that time, which is 2/2 = 1 hour.

So, in one session, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

In four weeks, he spends 9 x 4 = 36 hours.

76	Cecilia has bought a puppy. According to her veterinarian, she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of her life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Now, let's calculate!

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup/day, so she'll need 180 cups.
After 180 days, she'll need 2 cups/day. There are 365 days in a year, so she'll need 2 cups/day for 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's 2 x 185 = 370 cups.
In total, she'll need 180 + 370 = 550 cups in the first year.
Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

So, uCecilia uzoyisebenzisa ibhagi eli-5! (Cecilia will use 5 bags!)"

84	The football team played 22 games, won 8 more than they lost. How many games did they win?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Igemu lilodwa lihle 22, liwine ngaphezulu kwezingu-8 kulolodwa. (The football team played 22 games, won 8 more than they lost.)

Let x be the number of games they lost. Then, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games is 22. So, the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. To find the number of games they won, add 8:

7 + 8 = 15

Gene goes on vacation 4 times a year.
He's been going on vacation since he was 23 years old, and now he's 34 years old.
So, he's been going on vacation for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In 11 years, he's gone on vacation 11 x 4 = 44 times.

Each vacation has a large side of his T-shirt, so he has 44 large sides in total.

Let's break it down:

1. The first time it went off, it went off 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it went off 3 times more than the first time, so 4 + 3 = 7 times.
3. The third time it went off, it went off half as much as the second time, so 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 times. But since it can't go off a fraction of a time, let's round it down to 3 times.

So, the answer is: 4, 7, and 3.

87	The company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the original salary each year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie turned 5 years old in the company last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service to the company?	9360	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Okay!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

Sylvie's original salary is $600 per month. Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she gets a 10% increase each year. To find 10% of $600, multiply by 0.1: $600 x 0.1 = $60.

So, her new monthly salary is $600 + $60 = $660.

After one year, she gets another 10% increase: $660 x 0.1 = $66. Her new monthly salary is $660 + $66 = $726.

After two years, she gets another 10% increase: $726 x 0.1 = $72.60. Her new monthly salary is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

After three years, she gets another 10% increase: $798.60 x 0.1 = $79.86. Her new monthly salary is $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

To find her annual salary, multiply by 12: $878.46 x 12 = $10,541.52.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service to the company is $10,541.52.

Let's solve the problem. Let Harald's record sales be x. Then Marilyn's record sales are 10x.

We know that the total sales are 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 didn't attend. To find the number of attendees, subtract 1/4 from 16:

16 - (1/4 × 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

She needs 0.75 gift bags per attendee, so:

12 attendees × 0.75 gift bags/attendee = 9 gift bags

Babies eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each, and there are 5 babies, so:
5 x 5 = 25 pounds

Total pounds of potato chips needed = 200 + 25 = 225 pounds

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato chips to the park!

92	Emily has 4 children known as Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Ami is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year younger, how old is Jackson?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* James is 10 years old.
* Corey is 1 year younger than James, so Corey is 10 - 1 = 9 years old.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 9 - 2 = 7 years old.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 7 - 5 = 2 years old.

So, Jackson is 2 years old.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
93	Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how many seconds can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Lee akwazi ukuthutha izihlabani zama-400 mita ngama-38 sekondi. Gerald akwazi ukuthutha izihlabani zama-400 mita ngama-40 sekondi, ngoba Lee akwazi ukuthutha izihlabani ngama-2 sekondi eningi. Gerald wenza ukudla kwakhe, okwakheka ukuthutha kwakhe ngama-10%. Ngakho Gerald akwazi ukuthutha izihlabani zama-400 mita ngama-36 sekondi.

(Translation: Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds, because Lee can run the hurdles 2 seconds faster. Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.)"
94	In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits is less than a dozen for the total number of dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets are there in total in that neighborhood?	348	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* There are 2 cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs. So, the number of cats is 2 x 60 = 120.
* The total number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.
* The number of rabbits is less than a dozen, which means it's less than 12. Let's assume it's 11 (we can adjust later if needed).
* The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 + 120 + 11 = 191.

So, there are 191 pets in that neighborhood!

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinto ezinhlanu ezili-191 ezitholakala endaweni yakuleli."" (There are 191 pets found in that neighborhood.)"
95	Of the 200 fifth graders, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls in Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two-fifths of 200 are boys, so:
2/5 × 200 = 80 boys

Two-thirds of 200 are girls in Girl Scouts, so:
2/3 × 200 = 133 girls in Girl Scouts

Total girls = Total students - Total boys
= 200 - 80
= 120 girls

Girls not in Girl Scouts = Total girls - Girls in Girl Scouts
= 120 - 133
= 13 girls not in Girl Scouts (Wait, what? That can't be right!)

Let me recheck... Ah, I see the mistake!

Girls not in Girl Scouts = Total girls - Girls in Girl Scouts
= 120 - 133 (This can't be right, let me recheck the question...)

Ah, I understand now! The question says two-thirds are girls in Girl Scouts, not that two-thirds of the total students are girls. So, let's recalculate:

Two-fifths of 200 are boys, so:
2/5 × 200 = 80 boys

Girls = Total students - Boys
= 200 - 80
= 120 girls

Two-thirds of 200 are girls in Girl Scouts, so:
2/3 × 200 = 133 (This can't be right, because it's more than the total girls!)

Let me recheck the question again... Ah, I understand now! The two-thirds refer to the girls, not the total students. So, let's recalculate:

Girls in Girl Scouts = 2/3 × Total girls
Let's assume Total girls = x
Then, 2/3 × x = 133
x = 133 × 3/2
x = 199.5 (Approximately)

So, Total girls ≈ 200 (Because we can't have half a girl)

Girls not in Girl Scouts = Total girls - Girls in Girl Scouts
≈ 200 - 133
≈ 67 girls not in Girl Scouts

98	Cars are lined up on the road. Some of these cars pass in the first 15 minutes of traffic, then 20 more cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes of traffic. 5 cars from the queue leave the highway to avoid traffic. If there were 30 cars on the road before, how many cars passed in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Kubonga ukuthola inani lamaqaphela asebenzisa amaqhuzu. (Let's find the number of cars that passed using the clues.)

Kwakukhona amaqa 30 emgwaqweni ngaphambi. (There were 30 cars on the road before.)

Amaqa 5 ayaqhubeka emgwaqweni ukuthola ukulahleka isivumelwano. (5 cars left the highway to avoid traffic.)

Kwakusasa ukuthi kubekwe amaqa 25 emgwaqweni. (So, there were 25 cars left on the road.)

Emizuzwini eyodwa, amaqa 20 ayaqhakaza. (In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars passed.)

Ukuthola inani lamaqa ayaqhakaza emizuzwini eyokuqala, sizokubonga ngamaqa 25 - 20 = 5. (To find the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes, we subtract 20 from 25, which gives us 5.)

Kusho ukuthi amaqa 5 ayaqhakaza emizuzwini eyokuqala. (So, 5 cars passed in the first 15 minutes.)

99	Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window frames in her large country cottage. Out of generosity, she has decided that tomorrow she will give 1 potted plant from each frame to friends and family. How many potted plants will Mary have left?	58	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, let's count!)

Mary received 18 new potted plants. She already had 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window frames, so she had 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants initially.

In total, she had 18 + 80 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each frame to friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number she gave away from the total: 98 - 40 = 58.

Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

100	Jerome had four friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed 1/4 more than the first friend, so 20 + (20/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, so 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the doorbell presses:
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the doorbell rang 175 times!

101	Solo is required to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to complete all the pages of reading, on average how many pages does he need to read per day?	6	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

102	John likes to drink a glass of water during the staftage, the chamcha and the charger. Finally, he drinks a glass of water before going to bed. John does this every day of the week, but on weekends he likes to relax and drink soda instead of water during the charger. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John drinks a glass of water during:

* Staftage (morning) = 1 glass
* Chamcha (lunch) = 1 glass
* Charger (afternoon) = 1 glass
* Before bed = 1 glass

Total glasses per day = 4 glasses

John does this every day of the week, so:

Monday to Friday = 4 glasses/day × 5 days = 20 glasses

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks soda instead of water during the charger, so he drinks 3 glasses of water and 1 glass of soda on each day.

Saturday and Sunday = 3 glasses/day × 2 days = 6 glasses

Total glasses of water per week = 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

Let's break it down:

Poppy does a quarter of 1,000 pieces, which is 1,000 ÷ 4 = 250 pieces.

Remaining pieces = 1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

Her mother does a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

Pieces left unplaced = 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total space inside all 3 boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the internal dimensions of one box:

Length = 5 inches - 2(1 inch) = 3 inches
Width = 6 inches - 2(1 inch) = 4 inches
Height = 4 inches - 2(1 inch) = 2 inches

The internal volume of one box is:
Volume = Length × Width × Height = 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal space is:
Total Space = 3 × 24 = 72 cubic inches

107	Frankie watches TV after his overtime every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite movie every night. On Wednesday, he watched a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his overtime early and watched a 1-hour and 30-minute episode. On Friday, he stayed up for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of television in total, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Frankie's TV watching habits:

* Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights x 1 hour/night = 2 hours
* Thursday: 1 hour 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 hours
* Total hours: 7 hours

Now, let's subtract the hours we know from the total:

7 hours - 2 hours - 1.5 hours - 2 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide the remaining hours by 0.5:

1.5 hours ÷ 0.5 hours/episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 thirty-minute episodes on Wednesday.

108	Henry is baking biscuits for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes the baking, he finds that he has baked 15 more biscuits than he expected. 5 biscuits fell out while he was putting them away to dry, and now he has a total of 110 biscuits. How many biscuits did Henry bake last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Henry has 110 biscuits now.
5 biscuits fell out, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 biscuits before that.
He baked 15 more biscuits than expected, so he expected 115 - 15 = 100 biscuits.
He wanted to make twice as many as last year, so last year he made 100 / 2 = 50 biscuits.

Uma uqhamuka amagallon angu-10, ungasebenza ngama-$30.00 (10 x $3.00).

(If you buy 10 gallons, it will cost $30.00.)

Uma ungathola i-cashback yegaseleyithi ngama-$0.20 per gallon, ungasebenza kanjani?

(If you get a cashback of $0.20 per gallon, how much will it be?)

Uma ungathola i-cashback yegaseleyithi ngama-$0.20 per gallon, ungasebenza ngama-$2.00 (10 x $0.20).

(If you get a cashback of $0.20 per gallon, you will get $2.00.)

110	Marcell and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most of the fruit, so they know how much they can get. Unfortunately, one makes a mistake because Beatrice's fruit was 2 rollers wide and 24 rollers long while Marcel's fruit was 3 rollers wide and 14 rollers long. If both of them ate all the fruit, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Kwame! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of fruit eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice.

Beatrice's fruit: 2 rollers wide x 24 rollers long = 48 rollers
Marcell's fruit: 3 rollers wide x 14 rollers long = 42 rollers

Total fruit eaten: 48 + 42 = 90 rollers

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 ÷ 2 = 45 rollers

So, on average, they ate 45 rollers of fruit each.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Izinto ezimbalwa zeeli zesamanzi azitholakala ngumzuzu wokuthola ekhaya.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows 1 foot in 16/20 = 0.8 seconds. The shore is 64 seconds away, so she'll row a total of 64/0.8 = 80 feet.

The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so it'll take in 2/10 = 0.2 liters per foot. After 80 feet, it'll take in 0.2 x 80 = 16 liters of water.

So, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat will have taken in 16 liters of water."

114	Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's picture of ducks in a zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, how many ducks can be seen in Jama's picture of ducks in a zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures.
Brittany's phone can hold 1/6 of that, which is 1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures.
Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds in Jamal's picture of ducks.
So, the number of birds in Jamal's picture is 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezintathu ku-pikicha ka-Jamal."" (There are six ducks in Jamal's picture.)

115	Sasha has found that the price of logs has gone up by 50% in the last few months after buying more logs. Since she has the remaining ones, she decides to sell them. She has the remains of ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each.	90	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the remaining logs Sasha has:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards x $10/board = $100

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards x $16/board = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the price of logs has gone up by 50%, Sasha can sell them for 150% of the original price. Let's calculate the selling price:

Selling price = $180 x 1.5 = $270

Sasha can sell the remaining logs for $270."
116	Katy brews coffee with small spoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 small spoons of sugar and cups of water, count the number of small spoons of sugar she used.	42	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukudla!"" (Let's count!)

Let's break it down:

Ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts are 7 + 13 = 20.

If Katy used a total of 120 small spoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up the equation:

120 = 20x

To find x, divide both sides by 20:

x = 120 ÷ 20
x = 6

Now, multiply x by the number of parts for sugar:

Number of small spoons of sugar = 7x
= 7 × 6
= 42

So, Katy used 42 small spoons of sugar!"

119	Adrien's total salary was 30 percent more than Lulah's. Four years later, her salary had increased, and she was making 40% more than she was making four years earlier. If Adrien's and Lylah's salaries were equal, and Adrien was making $40,000 four years earlier, what would be the total salary that these two people were earning four years later?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step.

Four years earlier, Adrien's salary was $40,000. Lulah's salary was 30% less than Adrien's, so:

Lulah's salary = Adrien's salary - 30% of Adrien's salary
= $40,000 - (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 - $12,000
= $28,000

Four years later, Lulah's salary increased by 40%, so:

Lulah's new salary = Lulah's old salary + 40% of Lulah's old salary
= $28,000 + (40% of $28,000)
= $28,000 + $11,200
= $39,200

Since their salaries are now equal, Adrien's new salary is also $39,200.

The total salary of these two people four years later is:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lulah's new salary
= $39,200 + $39,200
= $78,400

122	Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each, because she needed to complete her extra work. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total for the whole week?	48	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

Monday: Sadie slept 8 hours.

Tuesday and Wednesday: She slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on each of these days. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

Thursday to Sunday: She slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours on each of these days. That's a total of 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours for the whole week.

Ngiyabonga ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (Thank you for the question!)"

124	Jennie helps in her mother's office. She has a draft of 60 letters that need to be stamped, and a draft of letters that already have stamps. She stamps one third of the letters that need to be stamped. If there are now 30 letters in the draft, how many letters were in the draft before Jennie started?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jennie started with 60 letters that needed to be stamped. She stamped one third of them, which is 60 ÷ 3 = 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters left in the draft. This means the draft had 30 + 20 = 50 letters before Jennie started.

Ngiyabonga (You're welcome!)"
125	Julia was hosting a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve soup. She noticed that her plastic spoons had run out, so she bought a pack of new ones. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. While Julia was preparing the soup, she used three of all the spoons to taste her soup. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Julia had no spoons initially.
She bought a pack of new spoons (let's call it x).
Her husband bought 5 more spoons.
She used 3 spoons to taste the soup.
She had 12 spoons left.

Let's set up an equation:
x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:
x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides:
x = 10

So, Julia bought a pack of 10 spoons.

126	Dylan needed to grow sausages and fish sausages to prepare the sausage sauce for the party. He bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 fish sausages more than chicken sausages. How many sausages did Dylan buy in total?	82	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

In total, Dylan bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

127	After moving to a new school, Amy had 20 more friends than Lily. If Lily had 50 friends, how many friends do Lily and Amy have in total?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Lily had 50 friends, and Amy had 20 more friends than Lily. So, Amy had 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends in total.

128	Mrs. Wells sells raisins, peppers, and oranges at a local store. The price of the raisins is three times the price of the peppers. The price of the raisins is 5 times the price of the oranges. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 raisins, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will he spend in total if the price of the peppers is $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Price of peppers = $15
* Price of raisins = 3 × price of peppers = 3 × $15 = $45
* Price of oranges = price of raisins ÷ 5 = $45 ÷ 5 = $9

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 raisins × $45 = $180
* 20 peppers × $15 = $300
* 10 oranges × $9 = $90

Total cost = $180 + $300 + $90 = $570

Dillon will spend $570 in total.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
129	The hospital treats 500 people a day. Each patient is treated for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. How much money does the hospital make from these trips?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

500 patients/day × 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

 Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours/day

Doctors' cost: 200 hours/day × $150/hour = $30,000/day

Hospital's revenue: 200 hours/day × $200/hour = $40,000/day

Hospital's profit: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000/day

In isiZulu, ""I-hospital iphumelela izimali eziyi-$10,000 ngosuku."" (The hospital makes $10,000 a day.)"

131	Joseph's expenditures in May were $500. In June, his expenditures fell by $60. What was the total of his expenditures for the two months?	940	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokuqonda ukuthi Joseph wayenawo izimali eziyi-$500 kuMay. KuJune, izimali zakhe zadingeka yi-$60. Inani lezimali zakhe ezintathu kuwo nyaka? (I understand that Joseph had $500 in May. In June, his expenses decreased by $60. What was the total of his expenses for the two months?)

Izincwadi zami zithi: Izimali zakhe kuMay = $500, izimali zakhe kuJune = $500 - $60 = $440. Ukuba ngicophe izimali zakhe zombili, ngizokuthola $500 + $440 = $940. (My calculations say: His expenses in May = $500, his expenses in June = $500 - $60 = $440. If I add his expenses for both months, I get $500 + $440 = $940.)

Kuyafana ukuthi izimali zakhe ezintathu kuwo nyaka yi-$940. (It seems that his total expenses for the two months are $940.)"
132	Pam and Fred went to the carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. After that, each of them decided to ride the roller coaster twice. If each ride cost six tickets, how many tickets did both of them use that day?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pam rode the roller coaster twice initially, and then twice again, so she rode it a total of 2 + 2 = 4 times.
Fred rode the roller coaster four times initially, and then twice again, so he rode it a total of 4 + 2 = 6 times.

Together, they rode the roller coaster 4 + 6 = 10 times.
Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used a total of 10 x 6 = 60 tickets.

133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles. On Tuesday, he walked six times the number of miles he had walked on Monday. His total from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the number of miles he had walked on Monday, so 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
From Monday to Tuesday, he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
His total from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles, so to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract 28 from 41: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Kubonga! (Well done!) Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

134	Tom gets his car washed 4 times a month. If he pays $15 for each car wash, how much does he pay for a car wash a year?	720	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundise ukuthi Tom uyawasha imoto yakhe amahora amane ngomzuzu. Uma uyaphakela $15 ngamahora amane, ungaphakela imali engaki ngonyaka?

Uma Tom uyawasha imoto yakhe amahora amane ngomzuzu, ungawasha imoto yakhe amahora angamane ngonyaka (4 x 12 = 48).

Uma uyaphakela $15 ngamahora amane, ungaphakela $15 x 48 = $720 ngonyaka.

(Translation: If Tom washes his car four times a month, he washes his car 48 times a year. If he pays $15 for four times, he pays $15 x 48 = $720 per year.)

Ngithola ukuthi Tom ungaphakela $720 ngonyaka! (I'm happy to say that Tom pays $720 per year!)"
135	Brian's friend Bobby has video games that are less than 5 times 3 of Brian's video games. If Bria has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison was made, how many video games does Bobby have?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Brian had 20 video games, but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games now.

5 times 3 is 15, so Bobby has less than 15 video games.

Let's say Bobby has x video games. Then, x < 15.

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a video game!), the largest possible value of x is 14.

So, Bobby has 14 video games.

136	There are only 27 horses left in the world. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two thirds of French Scots are female. How many Scottish females are there?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1/3 of 27 horses are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 horses.
* 2/3 of French Scots are female, so if we assume all Scottish horses are French Scots (just for simplicity), then 2/3 of 9 horses are female, which is 9 × 2/3 = 6 females.

So, there are 6 Scottish female horses. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
137	Rory has ordered 2 sandwiches for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 biscuits for $1.00 each. There is a 20% delivery fee added at checkout and she wants to add a $5.00 deposit. What will the total cost be?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Sandwiches: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Chips: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
Biscuits: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Subtotal: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery fee (20% of subtotal): $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
Total: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Adding deposit: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost will be $29.00.

138	Mark did a 75-question exercise yesterday. He completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he did another 100-question exercise at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first exercise and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unfinished?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday, Mark did 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours, so he completed:

5 questions/hour x 8 hours = 40 questions

He left:

75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions unfinished

Today, Mark did 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 6 hours, so he completed:

5 questions/hour x 6 hours = 30 questions

He left:

100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions unfinished

In total, Mark left 35 + 70 = 105 questions unfinished.

140	Of the 20 vehicles available for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of these are semi-automatic?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic vehicles: 20 (total) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 (semi-automatic)

Now, let's find the percentage: (4/20) × 100% = 20%

So, 20% of the vehicles are semi-automatic.

141	There are 700 bees in a hive. The number of worker bees is twice that of the queen bee, and the number of queen bees is three times that of the queen bee. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Inkosi bees (queen bees) = x
* Ama-worker bees (worker bees) = 2x
* Ama-queen bees (queen bees) = 3x
* Total bees = 700

We know that the number of queen bees is three times that of the queen bee, so:
Ama-queen bees = 3x = x (since there's only one queen bee)
x = 1

Now, let's find the number of worker bees:
Ama-worker bees = 2x = 2(1) = 2

So, there are 2 queen bees and 2 worker bees. But wait, we need to find the total number of worker bees!

Let's use the total number of bees:
700 = 2 (queen bees) + 2 (worker bees) + x (worker bees)
x = 696

Ama-worker bees = 696

Sawubona! There are 696 worker bees in the hive!"

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, and he has a part-time job that pays $10 an hour. If he spent his time playing video games working, he would work 2 hours a day.

In a week, there are 7 days. So, Jordan would work 2 hours/day × 7 days = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, he would earn 14 hours × $10/hour = $140 in a week.

143	John buys the milk for $2, the eggs for $3, the incandescent bulbs for $3, the cups for $3, and the bug traps for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, what was the total cost?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Food items:
Milk = $2
Eggs = $3
Total food cost = $2 + $3 = $5

Non-food items:
Incandescent bulbs = $3
Cups = $3
Bug traps = $4
Total non-food cost = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

10% tax on non-food items = $10 x 0.1 = $1
Total non-food cost with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Total cost = Total food cost + Total non-food cost with tax
= $5 + $11
= $16

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The total cost is $16."
144	Kim has started her home cleaning business and calculates the profit she'll make from the customers. She already has 3 customers, but she's talking to 5 others and feels brave enough to add them to her calculations. Each customer's house will need 2 bottles of chlorine and one pack of wiping cloths. The chlorine bottles are $2 each and the cloth packs will cost $5 each. These are her only utility costs. She calculates that her total weekly income will be $92. The profit is the difference between total revenue and total utility costs, so how much profit, in dollars, will Kim make per week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 customers already and 5 more, so she'll have 3 + 5 = 8 customers.

Each customer needs 2 bottles of chlorine, so she'll need 8 x 2 = 16 bottles. Each bottle costs $2, so the total cost of chlorine is 16 x $2 = $32.

Each customer needs 1 pack of wiping cloths, so she'll need 8 x 1 = 8 packs. Each pack costs $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 x $5 = $40.

The total utility cost is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total weekly income is $92, so her profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Kim will make a profit of $20 per week.

How many Lego bricks would Johnny pick up if he picked up all the Lego bricks?	2,125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Johnny had a box of 500 Lego bricks.
* Another box had three times as many, so that's 3 x 500 = 1500 Lego bricks.
* Another box had a quarter as many, so that's 500 / 4 = 125 Lego bricks.

Adding them all up, Johnny would pick up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego bricks.

* 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours.
* Half of 30 (15) bees come back in the next 6 hours.
* Twice 30 (60) bees leave in the next 6 hours.
* All the bees that left before come back in the last 6 hours, which is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Steve lives 3 miles from school and can cycle at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim can use his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser gets home?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet.
* He cycles at 440 feet per minute, so it'll take him 15,840 ÷ 440 = 36 minutes to get home.
* Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet.
* He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it'll take him 10,560 ÷ 264 = 40 minutes to get home.
* Since Steve gets home first, he'll wait for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim arrives.

So, the winner (Steve) will wait 4 minutes at home before the loser (Tim) gets home. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
151	Shawnda has decided that the kids in her neighborhood can actually use the bicycle air service. She decides the best way to charge is per tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to air. On the first day, 5 people on a bicycle came to be aired on their two tires each. 3 people came to be aired on their three tires each. Finally, one person came on a one-wheeled bicycle. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

5 people with 2 tires each = 5 x 2 = 10 tires
Each tire costs 25 cents, so 10 tires cost = 10 x 0.25 = 2.50 dollars

3 people with 3 tires each = 3 x 3 = 9 tires
Each tire costs 25 cents, so 9 tires cost = 9 x 0.25 = 2.25 dollars

1 person with 1 tire = 1 x 0.25 = 0.25 dollars

Total earnings = 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5.00 dollars

152	Carl buys ten packs of biscuits. Each packet contains six biscuits. Each biscuit costs $0.10. How much money will Carl get back if he pays with a $10 bill?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the biscuits:

10 packs x 6 biscuits/pack = 60 biscuits
60 biscuits x $0.10/biscuit = $6.00

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will get:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl will get $4.00 back.

153	Dave bought a large package of chips and ate fourteen before his hungry uncle stole the package from his hand. When the uncle landed, he baked half of the chips that Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons chased him out of the food, and each dove ate three chips. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. The raccoons carried the last chip, leaving five behind. How many chips were in the package when Dave bought it?	48	"Nkɔso! (Ahaha!) Let's solve this problem together!

Let's start from the end:

* The raccoons left 5 chips behind and carried 1 chip, so there were 5 + 1 = 6 chips before the raccoons stole them.
* Since the raccoons stole two-thirds of the remaining chips, the remaining chips before the raccoons came were 6 / (1 - 2/3) = 6 / (1/3) = 18 chips.
* Before the pigeons came, there were 18 + 3*3 = 18 + 9 = 27 chips.
* The uncle baked half of the 14 chips Dave ate, so the uncle baked 14/2 = 7 chips. This means there were 27 + 7 = 34 chips before the uncle baked them.
* Dave ate 14 chips, so there were 34 + 14 = 48 chips in the package when Dave bought it.

So, the answer is: 48 chips were in the package when Dave bought it!

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo the college student has three 1-hour classes each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 classes/day × 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 classes/day × 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day × 2 days/week = 8 hours/week
Total hours/week = 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week
In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so:
Total hours/semester = 17 hours/week × 16 weeks = 272 hours

155	Bill bakes 300 sconces, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day - each one 4 inches long, each croissant 6 inches long, and each baguette 2 feet high. If Bill were to line up all these items, how many feet would that line be?	280	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total length of each item:

* 300 sconces x 4 inches = 1200 inches
* 120 chocolate croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes x 2 feet = 120 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Finally, convert the total inches to feet: 3360 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the line would be 280 feet long! Ukubonga, Bill! (Well done, Bill!)"
156	A zookeeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from the local farm every two months. If a monkey needs 200 bananas, a chimpanzee needs 400, and a chimpanzee needs 100 bananas a month, how many are needed for two months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A monkey needs 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, it's 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.
* A chimpanzee needs 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, it's 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.
* A gorilla needs 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, it's 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

So, in total, the zookeeper needs 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas for two months.

157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run the longest in 15 minutes. They decide to compete on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running back and forth to the 40-yard line. She does this 34 times. How much further did the winner run than the loser?	80	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! Let me calculate the answer for you.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a total distance of 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards, and then runs back and forth to the 40-yard line 34 times, which is an additional 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. So, Kelly covers a total distance of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

The winner is Blake, and he ran 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards further than Kelly.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""UBlake ubholile kakhulu kun Kelly ngamayadi ayi-80."" (Blake ran further than Kelly by 80 yards.)"
158	Raphael went out to buy some school supplies: 4 pens for $1.5 each, 2 notebooks for $4 each, and a roll of paper for $20. How much did Raphael spend on each item?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Raphael bought 4 pens for $1.5 each, so he spent 4 x $1.5 = $6 on pens.

He bought 2 notebooks for $4 each, so he spent 2 x $4 = $8 on notebooks.

He also bought a roll of paper for $20.

So, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""URaphael uhambe ukuthenga izinto zikole: amapeni angu-4 ayimali $1.5 ngakunye, amanotbukhu angu-2 ayimali $4 ngakunye, futhi irholi lepepu ayimali $20. Wathenga kanjani amalali ngalokho?"""

161	Anakin and Locsin went ashore today. Anakin caught 10 octopuses, 6 seahorses, and 3 seahorses, while Locsin caught 5 octopuses less than Anakin, 3 seahorses less than Anakin, and 2 seahorses more than Anakin. How many fish did both of them catch in total?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Anakin caught:
- 10 octopuses
- 6 seahorses
- 3 seahorses (total seahorses = 6 + 3 = 9)

Locsin caught:
- 5 octopuses less than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5 octopuses
- 3 seahorses less than Anakin = 9 - 3 = 6 seahorses
- 2 seahorses more than Anakin = 9 + 2 = 11 seahorses

Total fish caught by both:
= Anakin's catch + Locsin's catch
= (10 + 9) + (5 + 11)
= 19 + 16
= 35

Kulungile! (That's correct!) They caught 35 fish in total."
162	If the price of a marble bag is $20 and that price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, what will the price of the marble bag be after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months = $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months = $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months = $34.56 + 20% of $34.56 = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months = $41.47 + 20% of $41.47 = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months = $49.76 + 20% of $49.76 = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months = $59.71 + 20% of $59.71 = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months = $71.65 + 20% of $71.65 = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months = $85.98 + 20% of $85.98 = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months = $103.18 + 20% of $103.18 = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months = $123.82 + 20% of $123.82 = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months = $148.58 + 20% of $148.58 = $148.58 + $29.71 = $178.29
After 26 months = $178.29 + 20% of $178.29 = $178.29 + $35.66 = $213.95
After 28 months = $213.95 + 20% of $213.95 = $213.95 + $42.79 = $256.74
After 30 months = $256.74 + 20% of $256.74 = $256.74 + $51.35 = $308.09
After 32 months = $308.09 + 20% of $308.09 = $308.09 + $61.62 = $369.71
After 34 months = $369.71 + 20% of $369.71 = $369.71 + $73.94 = $443.65
After 36 months = $443.65 + 20% of $443.65 = $443.65 + $88.73 = $532.38

So, the price of the marble bag after 36 months will be approximately $532.38.

163	In the room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 weapons, and a doll. One doll costs the same as 3 weapons and one red car is $4. What is the cost of all the toys, if one weapon costs $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One doll costs the same as 3 weapons, so the cost of one doll is 3 x $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost 5 x $4 = $20.

Three weapons cost 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (doll) + $15 (weapons) = $50.

Kubonga! (Well done!) The cost of all the toys is $50."
164	Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or find an accountant for her. If she does her taxes herself, she will be able to do 3 hours of her freelance work, losing $35 an hour. The accountant charges her $90. How much money will she save if she gives the accountant the job?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of Jackie doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose 3 x $35 = $105.

If she hires an accountant, she'll pay $90.

To find out how much she'll save, subtract the cost of hiring an accountant from the cost of doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will save $15 if she gives the accountant the job.

167	Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, their combined age will be 28. How old is Seth?	16	"""Odi oyi oyi! (Ahaha, okay!) 

Let's break it down, my friend. 

Let Brooke's current age be x. Then Seth's current age is 2x, since he's twice as old as Brooke. 

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. 

Their combined age in two years will be 28, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28 

Combine like terms: 

3x + 4 = 28 

Subtract 4 from both sides: 

3x = 24 

Divide by 3: 

x = 8 

So Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old, he's currently 2 × 8 = 16 years old. 

Seth is 16 years old, my friend!

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice. Each gallon they make costs them $3 of lemon and $2 of sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and a gallon carries 20 glasses. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

They sell each glass for $0.50, and a gallon carries 20 glasses, so they make $10 per gallon (20 x $0.50).

The cost of each gallon is $3 of lemon and $2 of sugar, so the total cost is $5 per gallon.

Let's say they made x gallons. Then, their total revenue is $10x, and their total cost is $5x.

They made a profit of $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5x = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

x = 5

So, they made 5 gallons.

The amount they spent on lemon is $3 per gallon, so they spent a total of:

$3 x 5 = $15

on lemon.

If Zaid is paid $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after all the expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

* Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
* Gasoline: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
* Stocks: 1/2 of $6,000 = $3,000
* Daughter's expenses: $200
* Wife's expenses: $700

Total expenses: $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $200 + $700 = $7,400

Let's solve the problem together. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, that means the winner got 3 parts out of 4 parts. To find the number of votes the winner got, we can multiply the total number of votes (80) by 3/4.

80 x (3/4) = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan. If Jan is currently 30, then two years ago, Jan was 28.

So, Mark was 28 + 5.5 = 33.5 years old two years ago. That means Mark is currently 35.5 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 35.5 + 2 = 37.5 years old.

The other team has no equally good runners; their first runner will run their 400-meter course in 60 seconds and then each of the next runners will be 3 seconds faster than the runner before them. Using this information, which team with the fastest run will win by how many seconds?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the times for each team:

Team 1 (best runners):

Team 2 (not equally good runners):
The first runner takes 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
The total time for Team 2 is:

184	Jerry is playing a six-sided die. Does he have a higher probability (in percent) of rolling a big number by 3 than rolling two odd numbers twice in a row?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Rolling a big number by 3 means rolling 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 50%.
* Rolling two odd numbers twice in a row means rolling an odd number on the first roll (3 or 5) and then rolling an odd number again on the second roll (3 or 5). The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/6 = 1/3. The probability of rolling an odd number again on the second roll is also 1/3. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities: 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/9.

So, Jerry has a higher probability (50%) of rolling a big number by 3 than rolling two odd numbers twice in a row (11.11%).

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"
185	Jenna and her mother picked apples from their apple orchard. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. If her mother picked 20 apples, how many apples did both of them pick?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many, which is 20 ÷ 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

186	Russel works in a pet store and distributes tubes among the rodents. The mice are placed in 3 enclosures in groups equal to each mouse is given 6 pieces of tubing. There are 10 enclosures of holes that are separated and each volume is given 5 tubes. There is also a group of rabbits where 20 pieces of tubing are distributed among the rabbits. No tubing was used elsewhere in the store. If 160 tubing pans were distributed among the rodents, how many mice are there in each enclosure?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

* Mice: 3 enclosures, each mouse gets 6 tubes, so total tubes for mice = 3x × 6, where x is the number of mice in each enclosure.
* Holes: 10 enclosures, each gets 5 tubes, so total tubes for holes = 10 × 5 = 50.
* Rabbits: 20 tubes distributed among rabbits, but we're not asked about the number of rabbits.

Total tubes distributed = 160. We know the tubes for holes and rabbits, so let's subtract those from the total:

160 - 50 - 20 = 90 tubes left for mice.

Now, we can set up an equation: 3x × 6 = 90. Simplify: 18x = 90. Divide by 18: x = 5.

So, there are 5 mice in each enclosure.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
187	Mendy owes $100 to Benedict. They have agreed to a monthly interest of 2%. If Mendy was able to pay after 3 months, how much should he give Benedict?	106	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the interest:

Principal amount = $100
Monthly interest rate = 2% = 0.02
Time = 3 months

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100 x 0.02 x 3
= $6

Total amount Mendy should give Benedict = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

Kubonga! (Well done!)

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Mendy kufanele abhadalele Benedict amadola ayi-$106."" (Mendy should give Benedict $106.)"
188	The seller buys bags of wheat flour from the farmer for $20 a bag. If the cost of transporting each bag from the field to the warehouse is $2, and the seller made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags for $30 a bag, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Umbuzo wakho ungumthakathi! (Your question is clever!)

Let's say the seller bought x bags of wheat flour.

Cost of buying x bags = 20x
Cost of transporting x bags = 2x
Total cost = 20x + 2x = 22x

The seller sold each bag for $30, so total selling price = 30x

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
400 = 30x - 22x
400 = 8x
x = 400/8
x = 50

Kutheni, usethengisi wasela amabhegi angu-50! (Therefore, the seller sold 50 bags!)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
189	Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 show tickets. They also bought food, and the ticket price was $4.50 higher than the food. They also went on 2 separate trips for $33 each. If they agreed to split all the expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the expenses:

1. 3 show tickets = $20.25
2. Food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 (since ticket price is $4.50 higher than food)
3. 2 separate trips = 2 x $33 = $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split the expenses equally, each friend paid:

$102 ÷ 3 = $34

So each friend paid $34.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
190	John collects peaches in 3 hours. He can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute. How many peaches will he collect in total?	360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""UJohn uyabamba amapechi emihuzeni eyi-3. Uyabamba amapechi amabili emizuzwini emi-1. Imipechi eyi-kanani izobamba?""

Now, let's calculate:

In 1 minute, John collects 2 peaches.
In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes, so John collects 2 x 60 = 120 peaches.
In 3 hours, John collects 120 x 3 = 360 peaches.

So, John will collect 360 peaches in total!"
191	Ducks need to eat a pound and a half of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they eat in total per day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If each duck needs 1.5 pounds of insects per week, that's 1.5 ÷ 7 = 0.21 pounds per day. Now, if there are 10 ducks, they'll eat 0.21 × 10 = 2.1 pounds of insects per day.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezintathu nezinkulungwane ezintathu zama-insekathi zidayisa ngosuku."" (They eat 2 pounds and 1 tenth of insects per day.)

I hope that helps, my friend!"
192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he also cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he would have planted 8 x 10 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 (initial trees) + 80 (newly planted trees) = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees die, which means 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees die.

Tom is left with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Utom unezitshumi eziyi-91."" (Tom has 91 trees.)"

199	Mark is a copy editor. He edits the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, each of whom pays him at a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays him. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much money does Mark make per week, per cent?	7500	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mark edits 1000 sentences in total, divided equally between two publishers. So, he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns 500 x 0.05 = 25 dollars from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Mark earns 2 x 25 = 50 dollars from Publisher B.

In total, Mark earns 25 + 50 = 75 dollars per week.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: 75 x 100 = 7500 cents.

So, Mark makes 7500 cents per week."

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six exercises each semester. He allows students to subtract the lowest score from the average score each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 for the first five exercises, how many points does he need to get in the sixth exercise to have an average of 93?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Brinley's total score without the lowest score:

Total score = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Lowest score = 71

New total score = 367 - 71 = 296

Average score = 296 / 5 = 92.8

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs:

Total score = 93 x 6 = 558

He already has a total score of 296, so he needs:

558 - 296 = 262

Since he has 5 scores, the sixth score should be:

262 - (296 - 71) = 262 - 225 = 37

However, this is not possible since the lowest score is 71. Let's recalculate:

New total score = 367

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs:

Total score = 93 x 6 = 558

He already has a total score of 367, so he needs:

558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs 191 points in the sixth exercise to have an average of 93.

Let's break it down:

* 25 chocolate candies, each weighing 40 grams, so total weight of chocolate candies = 25 x 40 = 1000 grams
* Since each chocolate candy weighs twice as much as an apple candy, each apple candy weighs 40 / 2 = 20 grams
* 80 apple candies, each weighing 20 grams, so total weight of apple candies = 80 x 20 = 1600 grams

Sara checks on her neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she checks on them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had a $10 savings before she started checking on the neighbor's kids, how many times will she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?	10	"Nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so that's a total of:

$30 (jacket) + 2 x $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara earns $5 each time she checks on the neighbor's kids, and she's done that 4 times, so she's earned:

4 x $5 = $20

She already had $10 in savings, so she now has:

$10 (savings) + $20 (checking on kids) = $30

To afford the jacket and shoes, Sara still needs:

$70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40

Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to earn the remaining $40, she'll need to mow the lawn:

$40 (remaining cost) ÷ $4 (mowing the lawn) = 10 times

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. A red hen produces 3 eggs a day, and a white hen produces 5 eggs a day. Each day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend.

Let the number of red chickens be x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red hens produce 3 eggs each, and the white hens produce 5 eggs each. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"

214	Jerry has two pools, both of which leak at the rate of 4 gallons of water per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool. Now the large pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be x gallons.

Since the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the large pool had 2x gallons of water.

Now, both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, they would have leaked a total of 4 x 4 = 16 gallons each.

Let's calculate the amount of water in each pool now:

Small pool: x - 16 gallons
Large pool: 2x - 16 gallons

According to the problem, the large pool now has four times the amount of water in the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x = 4x - 48
2x - 4x = -48
-2x = -48
x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it leaked 16 gallons, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

218	Adrian is three times older than Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Calculate the average age of all three after three years if Harriet's present age is 21.	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Harriet's present age is 21.

Since Harriet is half as old as Zack, Zack's present age is 2 × 21 = 42.

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's present age is 3 × 21 = 63.

After three years, their ages will be:

Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

The average age of all three is: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

So, the average age of all three after three years is 45.

219	Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of them. Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's score, and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's score, which is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The fourth student scored the remaining points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

224	Carlos and Benji are on the beach. Carlos rents a boat for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses his boat for 3 hours and Benji uses his for 5 hours, how much will they both pay in total?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Carlos rents a boat for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he pays:
30 x 3 = $90

Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays:
18 x 5 = $90

Together, they pay:
90 + 90 = $180

So, they will both pay $180 in total.

Let's break it down:

Traveling by bus takes 6 days. Traveling by car takes half of that, which is 6 ÷ 2 = 3 days.

To find the total travel time, add the days: 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

So, Andrew will travel for 9 days. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
226	James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage chance of picking the corresponding card of the water type (in near perfect numbers)?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, James had 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water cards. That's a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

He loses 8 water cards, so he's left with 40 - 8 = 32 water cards.

He buys 14 more grass cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass cards.

The new total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water-type card is the number of water cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100:

(32 water cards / 96 total cards) × 100 = 33.33%

So, the percentage chance of picking a water-type card is approximately 33.33%.

227	Chad ordered a homemade barbecue for lunch. The lowest barbecue is $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, $1.00 of garlic and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. Then he decides to enhance his meal for $3.00 in addition to adding a snack and a drink. Here's the $5.00 gift card he uses to pay. How much money does he still owe?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

* Lowest barbecue: $6.50
* Extra meat: $2.00
* Extra cheese: $1.00
* Garlic: $1.00
* 2 sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
* Enhance meal: $3.00
* Snack and drink: assume this is included in the enhance meal cost
* Total cost: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad uses a $5.00 gift card, so he still owes:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Chad still owes $9.00."
228	Callie solves a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Callie can usually add 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can basically do half of what Callie can do in a minute. How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Callie can add 4 pieces in a minute, and her mother can do half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it'll take to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute:

360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it'll take them:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

to complete the puzzle.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
229	Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the ticks were ready to harvest, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining ticks were ready, so she harvested them. How many ticks were not ready to harvest after those two weeks?	21	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Let's do it"" in Igbo!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the ticks ready to harvest. That means 70% were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining ticks were ready. To find the remaining ticks, we'll convert the fraction to a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75.

So, 0.75 of the 70% were ready, which means 0.25 of the 70% were not ready.

To find the percentage of ticks not ready, multiply 0.25 by 70%: 0.25 × 0.7 = 0.175 or 17.5%.

Therefore, 17.5% of the ticks were not ready to harvest after those two weeks.

230	Mark buys 12 cars from his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on these cars and then $1000 registration fee for each of them. What is the total amount he paid for everything?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark buys 12 cars for $20,000 each, so the total cost is:
12 x $20,000 = $240,000

He pays 10% tax, which is:
$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

He also pays a $1000 registration fee for each car, so that's:
12 x $1000 = $12,000

Now, let's add up the total amount he paid:
$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Umark ukuthola imali engu-$276,000."" (Mark paid a total of $276,000.)

234	Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to plant his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his fiancée. He eats 6 a day. If a single tomato tree can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how many tomato trees does he need?	21	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I love getting into a conversation!)

Let's break it down, my friend!

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and he eats twice as much as his fiancée, so his fiancée eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 tomatoes a day.

Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.

Since a single tomato tree produces 3 tomatoes a week, we need to find out how many tomatoes they need in a week.

9 tomatoes/day × 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, let's divide the total tomatoes they need per week by the number of tomatoes a single tree produces per week:

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/week/tree = 21 trees

So, Steve needs 21 tomato trees to meet their weekly tomato demand!"

239	The hall had three doors, A, B, and C, used for entering and exiting. If after the meeting 30 percent of the students left the building through door A, 3/5 of the rest through door B, and the rest through door C, count the number of students who left through door C.	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let the total number of students be x.

30% of x left through door A, which is 0.3x.

The rest is x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

3/5 of the rest, which is 0.7x, left through door B. This is (3/5) × 0.7x = 0.42x.

The rest, which is 0.7x - 0.42x = 0.28x, left through door C.

Now, let's find the number of students who left through door C. If x = 100 (just to make it easy), then 0.28x = 28.

So, 28 students left through door C.

John has twice as many sweets as Robert, and John has 54 sweets. So, Robert has half of 54, which is 27 sweets.

James has 6 more sweets than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 sweets.

Let's break this down:

Mike has 5 - 2 = 3 friends left.
They send him 2 letters a week, so he receives 2 x 3 = 6 letters.
Each letter is 5 pages long, so he receives 6 x 5 = 30 pages.
He responds generously, so he writes 30 pages back.

It takes him 6 minutes to write a page, so it takes him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes to write all the pages.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing letters a week.

Let's calculate Jason's remaining minutes:

Jason's daily usage: 15 minutes
Total daily usage for 30 days: 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes

244	Griffin had 24 chips, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin several chips, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 fewer chips than Kyle had taken. If Griffin ended up with 27 chips, how many chips did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 chips initially.
Kyle took 5 chips, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 chips left.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 × 5 = 10 chips. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 chips left.
Ginger gave Griffin some chips, let's call it x. So, Griffin had 9 + x chips.
Colby took 3 fewer chips than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 chips. So, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x chips left.
But we know Griffin ended up with 27 chips. Therefore, 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 chips.

So, there are 14 fish in each tangisamaki!"
246	Jean's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She needs very expensive makeup for the film she's making and it takes 6 hours to make every day and it needs to be done 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is finished the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work she did. How much did Jean pay her?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
* It takes 6 hours to make up Jean every day, so that's $250 x 6 = $1500 per day.
* This needs to be done 4 times a week, so that's $1500 x 4 = $6000 per week.
* The film takes 5 weeks to complete, so that's $6000 x 5 = $30,000.
* The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, which is $30,000 x 0.1 = $3000.
* So, Jean pays $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her brother ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her brother ate 5 cookies, so let's assume her sister ate x cookies. Then, Sue ate 4x cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her brother ate 13 cookies, so let's assume her sister ate y cookies. Then, Sue ate 2y cookies.

We know the brother ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so the total cookies eaten by the brother is 5 + 13 = 18.

Let's assume the total cookies eaten by Sue's sister is x + y. Since the brother ate 18 cookies, the total cookies eaten by Sue and her sister is 18 + x + y.

We know Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday and 2y cookies on Tuesday, so the total cookies eaten by Sue is 4x + 2y.

Since the total cookies eaten by Sue and her sister is 18 + x + y, we can set up the equation:

4x + 2y = 18 + x + y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + y = 18

Now, let's find the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister. We know x + y = 18 - 3x. Since Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday and 2y cookies on Tuesday, the total cookies eaten by Sue's sister is x + y = 18 - 3x.

Substituting x + y into the equation, we get:

x + (18 - 3x) = 18 - 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 6

Now that we have x, we can find y:

y = 18 - 3x
y = 18 - 3(6)
y = 18 - 18
y = 0

So, Sue's sister ate 6 cookies on Monday and 0 cookies on Tuesday.

The total cookies eaten by Sue is 4x + 2y = 4(6) + 2(0) = 24.

The total cookies eaten by Sue's sister is x + y = 6 + 0 = 6.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories eaten by Sue is 24 x 200 = 4800.

The total calories eaten by Sue's sister is 6 x 200 = 1200.

So, Sue ate 4800 - 1200 = 3600 more calories than her sister.
