0	Janet's parents are celebrating on Sunday, November 16th. In the morning, they eat three cookies and use the rest to make muffins for their friends. The rest, she sells the next day for her chicken soup that she purchased 2 pounds of a new chicken. How much (in dollars) will she make the next day for her chicken soup?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

The problem doesn't mention the initial number of cookies, so we can't determine the exact amount Janet will make. However, we can try to understand the sequence of events:

1. Janet's parents eat 3 cookies.
2. They use the rest to make muffins for their friends.
3. Janet sells the remaining cookies the next day.
4. She uses the money to buy 2 pounds of chicken for her chicken soup.

Since we don't know the initial number of cookies or their price, we can't calculate the exact amount Janet will make. But we can say that she'll make some money from selling the remaining cookies, which will be used to buy the chicken for her soup.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Akukho ukuthola ukuthi uJanet uzokuthola imali engani, kodwa uzokuthola imali ekhethekile kusuka kwalezi kuki."" (We can't determine how much money Janet will make, but she'll make some money from selling those cookies.)

I hope that helps, my friend!"	2
1	one piece of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric and half the amount of white fabric. how many layers of fabric do we need for the whole piece of clothing	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukudla kwemvikeli emibili, futhi kukhona amaphesenti angamashumi amahlanu emnyama. Kutheni ukudla kwemvikeli ongakhetha ukudla kwemvikeli wosuku lokudla?""

Translated to English, that means: ""Two layers of thin fabric, and half the amount of white fabric. How many layers of fabric do we need for the whole piece of clothing?""

Let's count the layers: 2 (thin fabric) + 1 (half of the white fabric) = 3 layers of fabric!"	3
2	Josh owns a home improvement business. He buys an 80,000-square-foot house and then invests $50,000 into the food business. The sale of the house increased the business by 150%. How much did the business benefit?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial investment = $80,000 (house) + $50,000 (food business) = $130,000

The sale of the house increased the business by 150%, which means the business grew by 1.5 times.

New value = $130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000

The business benefited by = $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000

4	In order to protect the health of her chickens, Wendy gives them three bowls of peas mixed with herbs and herbs. She gives them three times a day. If she wants to give them another 25, she will give them the same amount of food at the end of the day, depending on the size of the chickens.	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Translation: ""Wendy feeds her chickens three bowls of peas mixed with herbs and herbs every time. She feeds them three times a day. If she wants to feed them 25 more, she will feed them the same amount of food at the end of the day, depending on the size of the chickens."""	25
5	Kylar borrowed money to buy months for the new house. One month is worth 5 pf but the second month she doesn't buy when she gets 60% of the stock. Kylar wants to buy 16 months. How much will it cost to buy them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kylar wants to buy 16 months. The first month costs 5 pf. For the remaining 15 months, she gets 60% discount, which means she pays 40% of the original price.

40% of 5 pf = 0.4 x 5 = 2 pf

So, the cost of the remaining 15 months = 15 x 2 pf = 30 pf

Total cost = cost of 1st month + cost of remaining 15 months = 5 pf + 30 pf = 35 pf

Kylar will pay 35 pf to buy 16 months.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	16
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has three times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep does Toulouse have, Charleston and Seattle combined?	260	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has three times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 3 = 60 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 60 x 2 = 120 sheep.

Now, let's add them up: 20 (Seattle) + 60 (Charleston) + 120 (Toulouse) = 200 sheep.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingama-200!"" (There are 200 sheep!)"	200
7	Carla is taking a 200GB file, removing the 2GB memory that occupies about 40% of the image, and Windows asks her to do some reworking. This takes about 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the image and start from scratch. How long does it take to recover the entire file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

8	Jean drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60mph, then turns around and doesn't realize that she's forgotten something important at home. She tries to get home at 4 hours, but it takes her two hours to get home because of a car accident. Half an hour later, she runs at 30mph and drives at 80mph at 4 hours. What is the distance between her home and home if the 4 hours are right?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jean drives for 3 hours at 60mph, so the distance she covers is:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60mph × 3h = 180 miles

Then, she turns around and drives back home, but it takes her 2 hours due to a car accident. Since she's driving in the opposite direction, the distance remains the same, 180 miles.

Half an hour later, she runs at 30mph. Let's convert the half hour to hours:
0.5 hours × 30mph = 15 miles

After running, she drives at 80mph for 4 hours. The distance she covers is:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80mph × 4h = 320 miles

Now, let's add up the total distance:
180 miles (initial drive) + 180 miles (drive back home) + 15 miles (running) + 320 miles (final drive) = 695 miles

So, the distance between her home and home is 695 miles.

Siyabonga! (Thank you!)"	695
9	If a worker works 40 hours a week, Elisa's hourly wage is 10 pf and she earns the same amount of energy for the hours she works per month. If a worker works 45 hours a week, how much is her hourly wage?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Elisa ukhokha imali engu-400 pf emenyweni wesikhathi esiyi-40. Uma ukhokha imali engu-400 pf emenyweni wesikhathi esiyi-160, inani eliphezulu lokukhokha kwakhe ngalokhu kuphela kwesigamu? (Elisa earns 400 pf in 40 hours. If she earns 400 pf in 160 hours, what is her hourly wage?)

Ukukhokha kwakhe kuphela kwesigamu kwaba ngu-10 pf. Uma ukhokha imali engu-400 pf emenyweni wesikhathi esiyi-160, ukukhokha kwakhe kuphela kwesigamu kwaba ngu-400/160 = 2.5 pf. (Her hourly wage is 10 pf. If she earns 400 pf in 160 hours, her hourly wage is 400/160 = 2.5 pf.)

Uma umsebenzi ukhokha imali engu-45 pf wesikhathi, ukukhokha kwakhe kuphela kwesigamu kwaba ngu-45/45 = 1 pf. (If the worker earns 45 pf in 45 hours, their hourly wage is 45/45 = 1 pf.)

So, the answer is 1 pf!"	1
10	A new procedure is repeated 60 times in the first month. The number of repetitions in the second month is three times more than in the previous month. Then the calculation is repeated for the remaining 30% in the third month. After all, how many times do we repeat the procedure in three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: 60 times
 Month 2: 3 times more than Month 1, so 3 x 60 = 180 times
 Month 3: 30% of the total in the first two months, which is 60 + 180 = 240. 30% of 240 is 0.3 x 240 = 72 times.

In total, the procedure is repeated 60 + 180 + 72 = 312 times.

11	Toula bought several bags of bread from the bakery. She bought three bags of twelve loaves of bread for $68, two bags of twelve small cakes for $80, and six bags of twelve small cakes for $55. How many bags did she buy?	694	"Nkɔnkɔɔ! (Ahaha!) 

Toula bought 3 + 2 + 6 = 11 bags of bread and cakes."	11
12	carlos wants to plant a single lemon tree. the average annual yield is 90 f. a year a tree will produce about 7 lemons that we will harvest if it costs 1.5 f per ton. the life expectancy of the tree is 3 f years. how many years does carlos have to wait for his lemon tree to be able to generate income.	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

1. Average annual yield: 90 fruits (lemons) per year
2. Harvested lemons per year: 7 lemons (assuming 7 lemons are harvested from the 90 fruits)
3. Cost per ton: 1.5 F per ton (we'll convert this to cost per lemon later)
4. Life expectancy of the tree: 30 years (not 3 F years, I assume it's 30 years)

First, let's convert the cost per ton to cost per lemon:
1 ton = 1000 kg, and assuming an average lemon weighs 0.1 kg, there are approximately 10,000 lemons in a ton.
Cost per lemon = 1.5 F per ton ÷ 10,000 lemons per ton = 0.00015 F per lemon

Now, let's calculate the annual revenue:
Annual revenue = Number of harvested lemons per year × Cost per lemon
= 7 lemons/year × 0.00015 F/lemon
= 0.00105 F per year

Since Carlos wants to know how many years it'll take for the tree to generate income, we need to find the break-even point. Let's assume the initial investment (cost of planting and maintaining the tree) is X F.

The tree will generate income when the total revenue equals the initial investment:
Total revenue = Initial investment
0.00105 F/year × Number of years = X F

To find the number of years, we need to know the initial investment X. If you provide that value, I can give you the exact number of years Carlos needs to wait."	0
13	Melanie is a housewife. When she bought the white house, she sold a third of the cats, then sold two of the red houses, and finally sold the remaining third of the orange house. If Melanie had 5 cats, how many cats did she own?	18	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""UMelanie wayeneamakati angu-5."" (Melanie had 5 cats.)"	5
14	If a dance studio has 20 dancers, 20% of them are new dancers, 25% are jazz dancers, and the rest are hip hop dancers. How many of them are hip hop dancers?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20 dancers in total
20% are new dancers = 0.2 x 20 = 4 new dancers
25% are jazz dancers = 0.25 x 20 = 5 jazz dancers

To find the number of hip hop dancers, subtract the new and jazz dancers from the total:
20 - 4 - 5 = 11

So, there are 11 hip hop dancers.

15	A seller chooses between two options: buy a piece of furniture that costs $5000 or buy a piece of furniture that costs $8000. if the seller calculates a financial gain of 2.5% on the sale of a piece of furniture as well as 1.2% on the sale of a piece of furniture in a month, if the seller makes a decision to increase the price of a piece of furniture to make money in the next month, how much will his profit increase?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Option 1: Buy a piece of furniture that costs $5000
Gain: 2.5% of $5000 = $125
New price: $5000 + $125 = $5125

Option 2: Buy a piece of furniture that costs $8000
Gain: 1.2% of $8000 = $96
New price: $8000 + $96 = $8096

To increase profit, the seller should choose Option 1, as the gain is higher. The profit increase would be:
$5125 - $5000 = $125

So, the seller's profit will increase by $125.

16	Two buses travel to San Rafael in one hour. We continue to drive to the end of the tunnel and then they both run about 80 miles. The next day, they travel to the end of the tunnel for about 150 miles. What is the distance between the buses that ran those two days?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi inani lezibusuku (Let me help you find the distance between the buses).

Day 1: Ibusuku lesi-2 lifika emgwaqweni wemigwaqo emile esibuzayo ngamaphesenti angu-80. (The two buses travel 80 miles each.)

Day 2: Ibusuku lesi-2 lifika emgwaqweni wemigwaqo emile esibuzayo ngamaphesenti angu-150. (The two buses travel 150 miles each.)

Ukuthola ukuthi inani lezibusuku, sizokucophelela ukuthi: (To find the distance between the buses, we calculate that:)

 Ukudla kwesibusuku sesi-1 = 80 miles
 Ukudla kwesibusuku sesi-2 = 150 miles
 Ukudla kwesibusuku ngokubonga = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

Kuthiwa inani lezibusuku ngalowo mbili izibusuku ziyisibusuku esizodwa ngamaphesenti angu-230. (So, the distance between the two buses is 230 miles.)

17	Jill's tuition is $20 an hour, and Bud's tuition is $30 an hour. If she works 35 hours a week teaching and 15 hours a week caring for the kids, how much does she make a year?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jill teaches for 35 hours a week at $20 an hour, so she makes:
35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week

She also cares for kids for 15 hours a week, but we're not given a rate for that, so let's assume it's $0/hour (since Bud's tuition is $30/hour, not Jill's kid-care rate).

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, Jill's annual income is:
$700/week x 52 weeks/year = $36,400/year

19	Marissa walks the 12 miles in one go. She takes an hour to walk the 4 miles of the U.S., and then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants half of her sister's mileage, she walked the 4 miles an hour before, how much of her sister's mileage (that's one mile an hour) should she use to calculate the remaining distance?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Marissa wabhodla imile yama-12 ngokuthi ayiqedi. (Marissa walks 12 miles without stopping.)
Wayisa isikhathi sesigamu ukubhoda imile yama-4 yase-US, futhi wayisa isikhathi sesigamu ukubhoda imile yamabili. (She takes an hour to walk 4 miles in the US, and another hour to walk the next 2 miles.)
Ukuba efuna ukuba ngu-50% wemile yakwesisi, wayabhodla imile yama-4 ngaphambi kwesigamu, kufanele asebenzise imile yakwesisi ukucophelela indawo encane?

Let's calculate:

Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and 2 miles in the next hour. That's a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. To walk the remaining 6 miles (12 - 6), she'll need 3 more hours (since she walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour).

If she wants half of her sister's mileage, and her sister walks at 1 mile per hour, her sister would need 6 hours to walk 6 miles. So, Marissa should use 3 hours of her sister's mileage to calculate the remaining distance.

Ngithola ukuthi Marissa kufanele asebenzise amahora asithupha yakwesisi ukucophelela indawo encane. (I think Marissa should use 3 hours of her sister's mileage to calculate the remaining distance.)"	3
20	There are 10 gallons of water, about two-thirds of the way. Doesn't anyone want to mix 15 gallons of pineapple water, or maybe a gallon of water? How many gallons of water are left in 24 gallons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* There are 10 gallons of water initially.
* Two-thirds of 15 gallons of pineapple water is 10 gallons (2/3 × 15 = 10).
* So, 10 gallons of pineapple water are added to the initial 10 gallons, making it 20 gallons.
* Then, 1 gallon of water is added, making it 21 gallons.
* Now, we need to find out how many gallons of water are left in 24 gallons. To do that, we subtract 21 from 24: 24 - 21 = 3 gallons.

21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond gave birth to Samantha a year before she was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how old are Raymond's children?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond gave birth to Samantha a year before she was 23, so Samantha was 22 when Raymond gave birth to her. That means Raymond is 31 - 22 = 9 years older than Samantha.

Since Raymond is 9 years older, and Samantha is 31, Raymond is 31 + 9 = 40 years old. But the question asks for the age of Raymond's children, not Raymond. Since Samantha is Raymond's child, and she's 31, the answer is 31.

Let's break it down:

The drill hole collapses 2 centimeters per hour.
From 13H to 17H, that's 4 hours.

24	Kyle bought the book more than it sold last year at $19.50, even though we returned 25% of the book's sales. How much did your book cost?	26	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! In isiZulu, I'll respond.

Let's break it down:

* Kyle bought the book for $19.50 more than it sold last year.
* 25% of the book's sales were returned, which means 75% of the sales remained.

Let x be the original sales price. Then, 0.75x is the remaining sales price after the return.

The equation becomes: 0.75x + 19.50 = x

Subtract 0.75x from both sides: 19.50 = 0.25x

Divide both sides by 0.25: x = 19.50 / 0.25
x = 78.00

So, the book's original sales price was $78.00.

29	Instead of buying shoes, Gloria found a pair of shoes that would increase her price. But she had to choose between a pair of shoes or two pairs of high-heeled shoes, both of which cost five dollars less than the price of the shoes. If the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes was $33 and the price of the other pair was twice as much, how much was the price of the shoes?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Both pairs of high-heeled shoes together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The shoes Gloria found cost $5 more than both pairs of high-heeled shoes together, so that's $99 + $5 = $104.

So, the price of the shoes is $104.

The ratio of their ages is 7:11, and the sum of their ages is 162. 

Let Darell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. 

We know that 7x + 11x = 162. 

Combine like terms: 18x = 162. 

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9. 

So, Darell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99. 

Since Allen's age is 10 years more than Darell's, we can set up the equation: 

Darell's age + 10 = Allen's age 

63 + 10 = 99 

True!"	99
31	Gunter tries to count the number of holes in each hole. He asks his friends to calculate the number of holes in the hole. One of them says 80. The other says he gave half as much as the one who gave 20. The third says he gave 25% more than the one who gave? What is the number of half as much as they gave?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

One friend says 80.
The second friend says half as much as the one who gave 20, so that's 20 / 2 = 10.
The third friend says 25% more than the one who gave 20, so that's 20 + (20 x 0.25) = 25.

Now, the question asks for the number of half as much as they gave. Since we're looking for half as much, we'll divide the numbers by 2:

80 / 2 = 40
10 / 2 = 5
25 / 2 = 12.5

So, the numbers of half as much as they gave are 40, 5, and 12.5.

32	Jean takes care of ten dogs. Does a dog need 0.5 hours a day to walk and do anything else? How many hours does Jean take a day to take care of the dogs?	35	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's calculate the time Jean spends on the dogs. If each dog needs 0.5 hours, and Jean has 10 dogs, then:

10 dogs × 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours

So, Jean takes 5 hours a day to take care of the dogs.

33	Gretchen has 110 medals. The gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. How many gold medals does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem in isiZulu, a beautiful African language.

Izimpande zaseGretchen ziyisi-110. Izimpande ezidumile ziyabalekela izimpande ezisiliva ngama-30. Izimpande ezidumile eziyini?

(Translation: Gretchen has 110 medals. The gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. How many gold medals does Gretchen have?)

Let's say the number of silver medals is x. Then, the number of gold medals is x + 30.

We know that the total number of medals is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver medals is 40. The number of gold medals is 40 + 30 = 70.

Izimpande ezidumile eziyini? Izimpande ezidumile ziyisi-70!

(Translation: How many gold medals does Gretchen have? Gretchen has 70 gold medals!)"	70

Raymond has 40 legs, and Aron has 10 more legs than Raymond, so Aron has 40 + 10 = 50 legs.

Siobhan has two fewer legs than Aron, so Siobhan has 50 - 2 = 48 legs.

35	Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 games. He scored 25% more points in the next 20 games. How many points did he score in total?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 games. To find out how many points he scored in the next 20 games, we need to calculate 25% more than 4 points.

25% of 4 is 1 (because 25% is the same as 1/4, and 1/4 of 4 is 1).

So, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the next 20 games.

In total, Mike scored 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day on Sundays, and we sell 4 yogurts for $5. How much would you pay for 30 yogurts?	75	"Nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so for 30 yogurts, it's like 30 / 2 = 15 Sundays.

Since 4 yogurts cost $5, 1 yogurt costs $5 / 4 = $1.25.

So, for 30 yogurts, it would cost 30 x $1.25 = $37.50.

39	A running horse is three times as fast as a walking horse, and if it stops it is twice as fast as a running horse. If it stops at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles can it run in one hour, if you know how it does 1/3 of its running time and 2/3 of its walking time?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

If the horse stops at a speed of 3 miles per hour, that means it's twice as fast as a running horse. So, the running horse's speed is half of 3, which is 1.5 miles per hour.

Since a running horse is three times as fast as a walking horse, the walking horse's speed is one-third of 1.5, which is 0.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered in one hour:

Running time: 1/3 of 1 hour = 20 minutes = 1/3 hour
Distance covered while running = 1.5 miles/hour × 1/3 hour = 0.5 miles

Walking time: 2/3 of 1 hour = 40 minutes = 2/3 hour
Distance covered while walking = 0.5 miles/hour × 2/3 hour = 0.33 miles

Total distance covered in one hour = 0.5 miles + 0.33 miles = 0.83 miles

So, the horse can run approximately 0.83 miles in one hour.

43	According to a nutritionist, one bag of potato chips produces 250 calories of protein. If a 300-g bag produces 5 calories of protein, how many potato chips would you eat if you didn't know how many calories you would eat a day in 2000 if you had eaten 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, we need to find out how many grams are in one calorie of protein. We know a 300-g bag produces 5 calories of protein, so:

300 g ÷ 5 calories = 60 g per calorie

Now, we want to know how many grams are in 250 calories of protein:

250 calories × 60 g per calorie = 15,000 g

Since we're looking for the number of potato chips, let's assume one chip weighs approximately 10 g (this might vary depending on the brand and type). Then:

15,000 g ÷ 10 g per chip = 1,500 chips

Now, let's talk about your daily calorie intake. You've eaten 1,800 calories, but you don't know how many calories you'll eat in a day. To be safe, let's focus on the 1,800 calories you've already consumed.

To find out how many potato chips you could eat, we'll divide your calorie intake by the calories per chip. Assuming each chip has approximately 10 calories (again, this might vary):

1,800 calories ÷ 10 calories per chip = 180 chips

So, if you didn't know how many calories you would eat in a day, you could eat around 180 potato chips.

50	Lloyd was the sole owner. His brothers made 252 eggs a day and sold them for $2 a dozen. How many eggs would Lloyd have had?	294	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of eggs Lloyd would have had.

If they sold eggs for $2 a dozen, that means they sold 1 dozen (12 eggs) for $2.

Since they made 252 eggs a day, they would have sold 252 ÷ 12 = 21 dozens a day.

If they sold 21 dozens a day for $2 each, they would have made 21 x $2 = $42 a day.

Now, since Lloyd was the sole owner, he would have had all the profit, which is $42 a day.

To find out how many eggs he would have had, we can multiply the number of eggs they made a day by the number of days. Let's assume they worked for 1 day.

Lloyd would have had 252 eggs.

Let's break it down:

From 13H to 16H, Tom's boat travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 10 x 3 = 30 miles.

To get back home, the boat travels at 6 miles per hour. Time taken to get back = Distance / Speed = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

Now, let's add the weight of the pencil: 7.5 pounds + 0.5 pounds = 8 pounds

Uriah's pocket was too heavy, so he had to remove some items. Since the sheet weighs 15 pounds, he can remove the 8 pounds (books and pencil) to make it lighter.

To find out how many pencils are left, let's subtract the weight of the books from the total weight removed: 8 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 0.5 pounds

Since each pencil weighs 0.5 pounds, there's only 1 pencil left to solve!"	1

Alxamis made 6 small catamaran spirits and 4 small catamaran spirits, but he did not make 12 small catamaran spirits and did not make large catamaran spirits. The day he had more than he used to, how many catamaran spirits did he make?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Alxamis made 6 small catamaran spirits, which cost $40 each, so he made 6 x $40 = $240.

He also made 4 large catamaran spirits, which cost $60 each, so he made 4 x $60 = $240.

In total, he made $240 + $240 = $480 worth of catamaran spirits.

But wait, the problem says he didn't make 12 small catamaran spirits, which would be 12 x $40 = $480. So, he made $480 worth of catamaran spirits, but not $480 worth of small catamaran spirits.

And it also says he didn't make large catamaran spirits, but we know he made 4 large ones! 

So, the question is asking how many catamaran spirits he made in total. Let's count them: 6 small + 4 large = 10 catamaran spirits.

If you add the driver's design and the empty carrier together, it costs 3755 livres. How many boilers can we make a large car that does not exceed its capacity?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Let x be the number of boilers.

The cost of the driver's design and the empty carrier together is 3755 livres.
The cost of each boiler is 15 livres.
The total cost of the car should not exceed 5000 livres.

We can set up the equation: 3755 + 15x ≤ 5000

Subtract 3755 from both sides: 15x ≤ 1245

Divide both sides by 15: x ≤ 83

So, we can make a large car with 83 boilers that does not exceed its capacity.

Stéphane may raise the price by $4.00 that same year. If we calculate the price of everything, how much did Stéphane save?	57	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial bill = $40.00

New bill = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

If Stéphane raises the price by $4.00, the new bill would be:
$50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00

But since the increase was only $3.00, the actual new bill is:
$40.00 + $3.00 = $43.00

Stéphane saved: $54.00 - $43.00 = $11.00

For the rest of the year (9 months), the company subtracts 10% of the cost. First, calculate 10% of $420:

$420 × 0.1 = $42

Now, subtract $42 from the cost for the rest of the year:

$140/month × 9 months = $1260
$1260 - $42 = $1218

To find the total cost, add the costs for the first quarter and the rest of the year:

$420 + $1218 = $1638

So, the cost to use the equipment that allows the company to sell all its products is $1638.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuthenga kwalezi zinto kuyindlela e-$1638."" (The cost of these things is $1638.)"	1638
64	Sophie wanted to go on a trip with her daughter and wanted to ban the practice of running because her water tank was always full. She ran 100 miles before filling it with water and then added 4 pairs of shoes to complete the race. When the race was over, she didn't know how to use the 12 pairs of shoes. How many miles could Sophie have run if only one was filled?	300	"Ewe, ""E dey confuse me o!"" (This is confusing!)

But let me try to break it down. Sophie ran 100 miles before filling her water tank, and then she added 4 pairs of shoes to complete the race. But how does that relate to the water tank being full? And what about the 12 pairs of shoes at the end?

I think there might be some misunderstanding or mixed-up information here. Could you please clarify or provide more context?

In Yoruba, I'd say ""Oriki omo, e joor"" (Patience, my child, let's try again)."	12
65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then cuts the screen time down to half an hour. This is done three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV a week?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV initially, then reduces it to 0.5 hours (half an hour). This happens three times a week.

Initial TV time: 2 hours
Reduced TV time: 0.5 hours
Total TV time per session: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours
Total TV time per week: 2.5 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 7.5 hours/week

So, Jim spends 7.5 hours watching TV a week.

66	A basketball team assembled three teams to compete. One team won a women's championship, one won a men's championship, and one won a five-a-side tournament. The teams also won a four-a-side tournament. How many points did all the teams win?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokuthola ukuthola imininingwane (Let me understand the information).

67	A jeweler opened a jewelry box. The box contained 175 diamond rings, 35 rubies more than twice the size of diamonds and emeralds more than twice the size of rubies. How many jewelry boxes were there?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 35 more than twice the diamonds = 2 x 175 + 35 = 385
* Emeralds: more than twice the rubies = 2 x 385 = 770

Adding them up, we get: 175 + 385 + 770 = 1330

So, there were 1330 jewelry pieces in the box.

68	Men are twice as likely to marry as women, according to Dr. Wertz. If there are 60 women and 5 children per teacher, how many children are there?	36	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! However, I must respectfully point out that the information provided does not allow us to determine the number of children. The statement about men and women marrying is not relevant to the number of children, and the number of women and teachers does not provide enough information to calculate the number of children.

70	During the week, Judy teaches five times a week. On Sundays, she teaches eight times a week. If she teaches 15 students for $15.00 each, how much money does she make per week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Judy teaches 5 times a week, and on Sundays, she teaches 8 times. That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 times a week.

She teaches 15 students at $15 each, so she makes 15 x $15 = $225 per session.

Since she teaches 13 times a week, she makes 13 x $225 = $2,925 per week.

Let's calculate the money Tommy makes:

Brownies: 43 x $3 = $129
Cheese cakes: 23 x $4 = $92
Total money: $129 + $92 = $221

Tommy makes $221! Odi nma!"	221
73	Shiela bought two sets of equipment so that she could call a replacement that would cost her $150 a month for three months. Even if we had a 2% increase, how much money would Shiela have to pay each month for 3 months?	255	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the new monthly cost with a 2% increase:

Original monthly cost = $150
Increase percentage = 2% = 0.02
New monthly cost = $150 + (0.02 x $150) = $150 + $3 = $153

So, Shiela would have to pay $153 each month for 3 months.

Let's calculate the total amount Artie made:

Soups: 12 pots x $2.74/pot = $32.88
Petunias: 9 pots x $1.87/pot = $16.83
Begonias: 17 pots x $2.12/pot = $36.04

Total amount: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $85.75

75	Luc Daffy builds high-rise buildings with sand from the sea. He calculates that the area of the roof of the house is half the area of the ground. If you add all the areas, what would be their width if you knew the width of the highest wall of 16 feet of wet concrete?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uma uLuc Daffy ebudaza amakhilimu amahle, ukuhlonza kwawo kukudla kwesandla sesihlanu. Uma ungaqonda ukuthi isikhathi sesiphelele siyinhloko, kubalulekile ukuthi uLuc Daffy aqhube isikhathi sesiphelele ngokucopheleleyo. Uma uLuc Daffy efuna ukuthola ukuthi isikhathi sesiphelele siyinhloko, kufanele aqhube isikhathi sesiphelele ngokucopheleleyo.

(Translation: Ah, I want to understand that when Luc Daffy builds high-rise buildings, the area of the roof is half the area of the ground. If you understand that the total area is the sum of the areas, it is important that Luc Daffy calculates the total area correctly. If Luc Daffy wants to understand that the total area is the sum of the areas, he must calculate the total area correctly.)

Let's break it down:

Let the area of the ground be x.
The area of the roof is half the area of the ground, so it's 0.5x.
The area of the wall is the perimeter times the height. Since the width of the highest wall is 16 feet, the perimeter is 4 times the width, which is 64 feet. The height is not given, but we can call it h. So, the area of the wall is 64h.

The total area is the sum of the areas: x + 0.5x + 64h.

Now, we need to find the width of the highest wall. Since we know the area of the wall, we can set up an equation: 64h = total area - x - 0.5x.

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact width, but we can express it in terms of the total area and the area of the ground.

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi uLuc Daffy aqhube isikhathi sesiphelele ngokucopheleleyo! (I hope Luc Daffy calculates the total area correctly!)"	0
76	Cecilia always buys a puppy. According to the veterinarian's recommendation, she must feed the puppy one bowl of food every 180 days. If she does, she must feed him 2 bowls of food every day for the rest of his life. Considering that her diet consists of 110 bowls, how many bowls of food does Cecilia feed the puppy each year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

77	Raymond's salary is twice as low as Sarah's, and Sarah's salary is three times that of David's. Knowing that Sarah earns 400 pounds, how much more do David and Raymond earn?	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah earns 400 pounds.

David's salary is 1/3 of Sarah's, so David earns 400 ÷ 3 = 133.33 pounds.

Raymond's salary is 1/2 of Sarah's, so Raymond earns 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.

To find out how much more David and Raymond earn, we subtract their salaries:

200 (Raymond) - 133.33 (David) = 66.67 pounds.

So, Raymond earns 66.67 pounds more than David.

78	Vincent had the option of buying 3 bottles of flowers for $2.50 or a bottle of 2 for $1. How much money could he have saved if he had bought 18 bottles that sold more easily?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Option 1: 3 bottles for $2.50, so 1 bottle costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
Option 2: 2 bottles for $1, so 1 bottle costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

If Vincent buys 18 bottles, the cost would be:
Option 1: 18 bottles × $0.83 = $14.94
Option 2: 18 bottles × $0.50 = $9.00

He could have saved $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94 if he had bought 18 bottles at the cheaper rate.

Two women each get 1/6 of 24 liters, so each woman gets 24 ÷ 6 = 4 liters. Together, they get 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

81	Charlie has 10 tapes. He bought another 21 that the family collected and used 23 of them to celebrate his birthday. Now, he gives his sister 9 and uses 28 of them to save the tapes that we write prayers and dedicate to our loved ones. How many tapes are left?	17	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Charlie had 10 tapes initially. He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 tapes.

The family used 23 tapes for his birthday celebration, leaving him with 31 - 23 = 8 tapes.

He gave his sister 9 tapes, but he only had 8, so he must have bought one more tape to give to his sister. Now he has 8 - 9 = -1 tape (he doesn't have any tapes left).

But then he used 28 tapes to save prayers and dedicate them to loved ones. This means he must have bought more tapes. Let's assume he bought 28 tapes. Now he has -1 + 28 = 27 tapes.

So, Charlie has 27 tapes left.

Grace weighs 25 pounds.
Four times Grace's weight is 25 x 4 = 100 pounds.
Twice that is 100 x 2 = 200 pounds.
Alex weighs less than 200 pounds, so let's assume Alex weighs 199 pounds (just a tiny bit less!).

The sum of their weights is 25 + 199 = 224 pounds.

How many times did the whole thing rotate?	22	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. First rotation: 3 times
2. Second rotation: 3 times
3. Third rotation: 2 times as fast as the second, so 3 x 2 = 6 times

87	A law firm pays its employees $600 a month. Dafy wants to increase the company's interest rate to 10% of her salary. Sylvie is celebrating her fifth anniversary with the firm last December. How much is a year's salary after three years?	9360	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down:

Dafy's current salary is $600 per month. 
She wants a 10% increase, which is $600 x 0.10 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.

Since Sylvie is celebrating her fifth anniversary, we'll calculate her salary after three years.
A year's salary is $660 x 12 = $7,920.
After three years, her total salary will be $7,920 x 3 = $23,760.

In isiZulu, we say ""Ngikhona!"" (I'm here!) to confirm the answer: $23,760."	23760

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Let Marilyn's company's turnover be 10x and Harald's company's turnover be x.

Since they sold 88,000 units together, we can set up the equation:

10x + x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald's company sold 8,000 units.

91	Marcia has three times as many pets as Cindy does. Marcia has twice as many pets as Cindy does. Cindy has four pets. How many pets do we have?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cindy has 4 pets.
Marcia has twice as many pets as Cindy, so Marcia has 2 x 4 = 8 pets.
Marcia also has three times as many pets as Cindy, so Marcia has 3 x 4 = 12 pets.

But wait, we have a contradiction! Marcia can't have both 8 and 12 pets. Let's assume the correct statement is ""Marcia has three times as many pets as Cindy does.""

So, Marcia has 12 pets.

In total, we have 12 (Marcia's pets) + 4 (Cindy's pets) = 16 pets.

Let's break it down:

* Jack is 10 years old.
* Corey is 1 year older than Jack, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
* Corey is 2 years younger than Jackson, so Jackson is 11 + 2 = 13 years old.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy is 13 + 5 = 18 years old.

So, Jackson is 13 years old.

93	In the morning, Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by more than two seconds over Gerald, but when Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by 38 seconds, how many seconds does Gerald run without changing his diet?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Ukuthola kwesikhathi, uLee waqedisa iminithi engu-400, waphumelela igamu ngaphezu kwesikhathi esiyi-2 esingena nguGerald. Kodwa uma uGerald echangea isidlo sakhe, waphakamisa izivakashi zakhe ngama-10%. Uma uLee eqedisa iminithi engu-400, waphumelela igamu ngosikhathi esiyi-38, ingaki isikhathi esingena nguGerald ngaphandle kokuchangea isidlo sakhe?

(Translation: In the morning, Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by more than 2 seconds over Gerald. But when Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by 38 seconds, how many seconds does Gerald run without changing his diet?)

Let's solve this:

Let Gerald's original time be x.

Lee won by 2 seconds, so Lee's time is x - 2.

When Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%, so his new time is 0.9x.

Lee won by 38 seconds, so Lee's time is 0.9x - 38.

We know Lee's time is x - 2, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 0.9x - 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40

So Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izinhlobo zokuhlala ziyadingeka ukuba zingaphezu kwezinhlobo zokuhlala zika-12 uma uqonda amanani amadog ne-cats. Uma kukhona izinhlobo zokuhlala ezingama-2 zamadog kanye nezinhlobo zama-60 zamakat, inani lezinhlobo zokuhlala ezikhona kulendawo?

(Translation: The number of households exceeds the number of households of 12 if you add the number of dogs to the number of cats. If there are 2 cat households and 60 dog households, how many households are there in the area?)

Let's solve it:

Number of dogs (60) + Number of cats (2) = 62

Since the number of households exceeds the number of households of 12, we subtract 12 from the total:

62 - 12 = 50

So, there are 50 households in the area!

* 2/5 of 200 are boys, so the number of boys is (2/5) × 200 = 80.
* The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.
* 2/3 of the girls are scouts, so the number of girls who are scouts is (2/3) × 120 = 80.
* The number of girls who are not scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.
* The percentage of girls who are not scouts is (40/120) × 100% = 33.33%.

96	Harry fell asleep at nine o'clock last night. His friend Jacques slept for two-thirds of that time. If you don't count Jacques, how many hours did Harry spend asleep?	3	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (That's ""okay"" in Akan, a language spoken in Ghana!)

Let's calculate the time Jacques slept: two-thirds of 9 hours is 2/3 × 9 = 6 hours.

98	We are a group of women who live on a narrow strip of land. One of the women will be able to cross the 15 kilometers long road and then the other 20 women will cross the 15 kilometers long road. 5 women will take a detour to avoid crossing the narrow road. if the 30 kilometers long road had a fixed base, how many women will cross the 15 kilometers long road?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inkululeko yakho. (I'll help you find the answer.)

Let's break it down:

* 1 woman will cross the 15 km road initially.
* Then, 20 women will cross the same 15 km road.
* 5 women will take a detour, so they won't cross the 15 km road.

To find the total number of women who will cross the 15 km road, add the initial 1 woman to the 20 women who will follow:

1 + 20 = 21

So, 21 women will cross the 15 kilometers long road.

100	One day, 4 friends went to visit Jérôme. the first person knocked 20 times before Jérôme opened the door, the second person knocked 1/4 as many times as the first person knocked, the third person knocked 10 times as many as the third person knocked. If you know how the third person knocked 60 times, how many times did the dog shake?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first person knocked 20 times.
2. The second person knocked 1/4 as many times as the first person, so 20 x 1/4 = 5 times.
3. The third person knocked 10 times as many as the second person, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, the problem says the third person knocked 60 times, not 50! Maybe there's a mistake?

Anyway, there's no information about a dog shaking, so I can't answer that part. Maybe the dog was just chillin' and didn't shake at all?

103	If the city stretches for 42 miles and if the sea level rises and the sea level sinks, how many steps will it take to destroy the entire city?	140	"Akwaaba! (Hello!)

Hah! That's a clever question, but I must respectfully point out that it's based on a few assumptions that don't quite add up.

Firstly, the sea level can't both rise and sink at the same time. It's either one or the other, my friend!

Secondly, the number of steps it would take to destroy an entire city is a rather abstract concept, don't you think? Cities are complex systems with buildings, infrastructure, and people, so it's not possible to provide a numerical answer to that question.

However, I'll give you a response in my native Twi language, just for the fun of it: ""Ɛyɛ hu! Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ deɛ!"" (That's not possible! There's nothing like that!)

104	Poppy wanted to make a bronze statue that would cost 1000 bronzes. she had to cut a third of the bronze to make the statue. then her mother cut a third of the remaining bronze to make the statue. how much bronze was left to complete the process of cutting bronze to make the statue?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step in isiZulu:

Poppy had 1000 amabronzi (bronzes) initially.

 Ukuba ufuna ukucutheka isithathu (one third) of the bronze, she would cut:
1000 ÷ 3 = 333.33 amabronzi (let's round it off to 333 amabronzi)

So, she's left with:
1000 - 333 = 667 amabronzi

Then, her mother cuts a third of the remaining bronze:
667 ÷ 3 = 222.33 amabronzi (let's round it off to 222 amabronzi)

Now, they're left with:
667 - 222 = 445 amabronzi

Kutheni, kune-445 amabronzi akapheli (Therefore, there are 445 bronzes left) to complete the process!"	445

108	Henri was preparing cookies that a cook had prepared for him. He wanted to make something twice as good as he had made before, but in the evening, he realized that he had made 15 more cookies than he had expected. After adding 5 biscuits, they were no longer refrigerated and now there were 110 biscuits. How many biscuits had Henri made before?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step, my friend.

Let x be the number of cookies Henri expected to make.

Since he made 15 more cookies than he expected, the total number of cookies he made is x + 15.

After adding 5 biscuits, the total number of biscuits is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 + 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

x + 20 = 110

Subtract 20 from both sides:

x = 90

Now, Henri wanted to make something twice as good as he had made before. So, if x is the number of cookies he made this time, the number of cookies he made before is x/2.

x/2 = 90/2
= 45

Therefore, Henri had made 45 biscuits before.

Let's count the peppers:

Béatrice has 2 large and 24 small peppers = 26 peppers
Marcel has 3 large and 14 small peppers = 17 peppers

If they eat all their peppers, half of what they eat is 43 ÷ 2 = 21.5 peppers

111	Julia's boat sank and she found herself in the river. The boat began to sink 2 liters of water that flowed ten feet towards the shore. It took eleven minutes for the boat to sink. The shore was 64 feet deep, how many liters of water did the boat sink?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* The boat sank 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it flowed towards the shore.
* The shore was 64 feet deep, so the boat sank a total of 64 / 10 = 6.4 times (since 64 ÷ 10 = 6.4).
* Since the boat sank 2 liters of water for each of those 6.4 times, the total amount of water it sank is 2 x 6.4 = 12.8 liters.

So, the answer is: ""Izimali zesamanzi ezisuka kwiloli ziyi-12.8!"" (The boat sank 12.8 liters of water!)

The forest of Brittany can hold up to 50 times as many birds as the forest of plants, even if the canals are located in the same area where the animals are. If Jamal's telescope of the 1800s can hold a statue, how many statues can we find?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

The forest of Brittany can hold 50 times as many birds as the forest of plants. Let's call the number of birds in the forest of plants ""x"". Then, the forest of Brittany can hold 50x birds.

Jamal's telescope can hold 6 times as many birds as the forest of Brittany. So, Jamal's telescope can hold 6(50x) = 300x birds.

Now, if Jamal's telescope can hold a statue, that means it can hold 1 statue. But we know it can hold 300x birds. So, we can set up the equation:

300x = 1

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 300:

x = 1/300

Now, we want to find the number of statues. Since the forest of plants has x birds, and Jamal's telescope can hold 300x birds, it can hold 300x statues. Plugging in x = 1/300, we get:

300(1/300) = 1 statue

So, we can find 1 statue."	1
115	After we bought some tablets, Shasha checked how much the sale had increased the price by 50% in the last few months. She now sells the remaining tablets. She had 10 2×4×10 tablets that she had bought 10 years ago and bought five 4×4×10 tablets that were worth 16 fps each. Given how much she had sold, how much was the increase compared to the original?	90	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Shasha benza izitabekithi ezine (Shasha had 10 tablets)
* Ezine zibe ngama-2x4x10 (Each tablet was 2x4x10)
* Wabonga amatabekithi amahlanu ase-4x4x10 (She bought 5 tablets of 4x4x10 each)
* Amatabekithi ase-4x4x10 ayengama-16 fps (Each 4x4x10 tablet was worth 16 fps)

Original price of 10 tablets = 10 x 2x4x10 = 800
Original price of 5 new tablets = 5 x 16 fps = 80 fps
Total original price = 800 + 80 fps = 880 fps

Since the sale increased the price by 50%, the new price = 880 fps x 1.5 = 1320 fps

The increase compared to the original = 1320 fps - 880 fps = 440 fps

119	Adrien's total salary was 30% more than Lylah's salary. Three years earlier, the salary had risen to more than 40% of what she had previously earned. While Adrien and Lylah's salary had risen, and Adrien had earned $40,000 three years earlier, their salary had risen three years earlier.	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step in isiZulu, my friend.

Izindleko zakhe zika-Adrien zaziyisithupha kwesalari sakhe sika-Lylah. (Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's salary.)

Izindleko zakhe zika-Lylah zazincane ku-40% kwesalari sakhe esikhathini esidlule. (Three years earlier, Lylah's salary had risen to more than 40% of what she had previously earned.)

Izindleko zakhe zika-Adrien zazingu-$40,000 esikhathini esidlule. (Adrien had earned $40,000 three years earlier.)

Let's use the information to find Lylah's salary three years earlier. If Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, that means Adrien's salary is 1.3 times Lylah's salary.

Let Lylah's salary three years earlier be x. Then, Adrien's salary three years earlier is 1.3x.

We know Adrien's salary three years earlier was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40,000

To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40,000 / 1.3
x = 30,769

So, Lylah's salary three years earlier was $30,769.

Now, we know Lylah's salary had risen to more than 40% of what she had previously earned. This means her current salary is 1.4 times her previous salary:

Lylah's current salary = 1.4 × $30,769
= $43,076

Sadie slept 8 hours a night usually. For 2 nights, she slept 2 hours more, so that's 8 + 2 = 10 hours per night. For those 2 nights, she slept a total of 10 x 2 = 20 hours.

For the rest of the nights, she slept 1 hour more than usual, so that's 8 + 1 = 9 hours per night. Let's assume there are 7 nights in a week, and she slept more for 2 nights, so she slept 9 hours per night for 7 - 2 = 5 nights. That's 9 x 5 = 45 hours.

In total, she slept 20 + 45 = 65 hours.

125	Julia is preparing for a dinner party at their house. So she decides to make ragout. She checks that there are no more couscous, and buys a pack of couscous. Later, her husband buys another pack of 5 couscous and gives it to Julia. When she cooks, Julia uses 3 couscous to cook the meal. When she cooks the first meal, she uses 12 couscous. How many couscous are in the package that Julia forgot?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Julia buys a pack of couscous (unknown quantity).
Her husband buys another pack of 5 couscous and gives it to Julia.
Total couscous Julia has = unknown quantity + 5.
Julia uses 3 couscous to cook the meal.
Julia uses 12 couscous to cook the first meal.
Total couscous used = 3 + 12 = 15.
Total couscous Julia has - Total couscous used = unknown quantity + 5 - 15.
Let's call the unknown quantity ""x"".
x + 5 - 15 = x - 10.

Since Julia had no couscous initially, x - 10 = 0.

126	Dylan had the experience of cooking shrimp and cooking fish in order to make a small cake with shrimp on one occasion. He bought 38 more shrimp sausages and 6 more fish sausages than he bought from the shrimps. How much did it cost to make all the sausages?	82	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuqonda ukuthi uDylan wayengena ngokukhetfwa kweshrimp nefish ukwenza icake encane negishrimp ngalokhu. Waqoka amashrimp sausage angu-38 kunezifish sausage angu-6 kunalezi zeshrimp. Kutheniwa imali yokwenza lezosa sausage zonke?

(To understand that Dylan was involved in cooking shrimp and fish to make a small cake with shrimp on one occasion. He bought 38 more shrimp sausages and 6 more fish sausages than he bought from the shrimps. How much did it cost to make all the sausages?)

Since we don't have the cost of each sausage, we can't determine the total cost. However, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the cost of 1 shrimp sausage.
Then, the cost of 1 fish sausage is x - 38.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of shrimp sausages and fish sausages.

We need more information to solve for x and find the total cost."	38
127	When we moved to another school, Amy outnumbered Lily's 20 friends. If Lily has 50 friends, how many friends do Lily and Amy have?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Amy anabantu abaningi kakhulu ku-20 kukaLily. Uma uLily unezabangane ezingama-50, ngaba nezabangane ezizingama-kuphi uLily noAmy?

(Uh, I want to find out that Amy has more friends than 20 of Lily's. If Lily has 50 friends, how many friends do Lily and Amy have?)

Ukuba uLily unezabangane ezingama-50, futhi uAmy anabantu abaningi kakhulu ku-20 kukaLily, ngakho uAmy unezabangane ezingama-70. Ngakho nezabangane ezizingama-kuphi uLily noAmy ngizama ukuthi ine-120.

(If Lily has 50 friends, and Amy has more friends than 20 of Lily's, then Amy has 70 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have is 120.)"	120
128	Well's mother sells toys, powders, and candy at the grocery store. A box of one toys can be a third box of candy, a fifth box of candy. We sent Dillon to the store to buy 4 toys, 20 toys, and 10 candies. How much money would it cost if each box was worth $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi uma unina kaWells uyaphothula izitoyi, amapawuda, nekhendi esitolo. Ukuthi ibhokisi elinye lizitoyi lingaba yibhokisi lesithathu lekhendi, ibhokisi lesihlanu lekhendi. Siye saDillon esitolo ukuthenga izitoyi ezine, amapawuda ayi-20, nekhendi eyi-10. Kutheni imali eyengezi ukuthi uma ibhokisi lingaba lilodwa li-$15?

(Translation: I understand that Wells' mother sells toys, powders, and candy at the store. One box of toys is a third of a box of candy, a fifth of a box of candy. We sent Dillon to the store to buy 4 toys, 20 powders, and 10 candies. How much would it cost if each box was worth $15?)

Ukubonga ukuthi ibhokisi elinye lizitoyi lingaba yibhokisi lesithathu lekhendi, okuthetha ukuthi ibhokisi lekhendi lingaba lilodwa li-3 * $15 = $45. Ukuthi ibhokisi lesihlanu lekhendi lingaba lilodwa li-5 * $15 = $75. Ukuthi siyathenga izitoyi ezine, amapawuda ayi-20, nekhendi eyi-10, imali eyengezi ukuthi $45 * 4 + $75 * 20 + $15 * 10 = $180 + $1500 + $150 = $1830.

(Translation: To answer, since one box of toys is a third of a box of candy, that means one box of candy is 3 * $15 = $45. Since one box of candy is a fifth of a box of powder, that means one box of powder is 5 * $15 = $75. Since we bought 4 toys, 20 powders, and 10 candies, the total cost would be $45 * 4 + $75 * 20 + $15 * 10 = $180 + $1500 + $150 = $1830.)"	1830
129	A hospital treats about 500 people a day. The average patient is treated in a tent for 24 hours. Doctors pay the hospital an hourly fee of $150, and $200 per patient. How much does the hospital make per page?	10000	"Kwame, nsɛm yiye! (Hello, my friend!)

The hospital treats 500 people a day, and each patient stays for 24 hours. So, the total hours of treatment per day is:

500 patients/day × 24 hours/patient = 12,000 hours/day

The doctors pay the hospital an hourly fee of $150, so the total hourly fee per day is:

12,000 hours/day × $150/hour = $1,800,000/day

Additionally, the doctors pay $200 per patient, so the total patient fee per day is:

500 patients/day × $200/patient = $100,000/day

The total daily revenue for the hospital is:

$1,800,000/day + $100,000/day = $1,900,000/day

Now, to find out how much the hospital makes per page, we need to know how many pages are in a day. However, I'm assuming you meant to ask ""How much does the hospital make per day?"" rather than ""per page"". If that's correct, the answer is $1,900,000 per day.

131	In May, Joseph's net worth was $500. This was followed by a decline in June. What is the sum of his net worth over the two months?	940	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The question doesn't provide the net worth for June, so I'll assume it's unknown. Let's use ""x"" to represent the net worth in June.

The sum of his net worth over the two months would be:
$500 (May) + x (June) = $500 + x

Without the June value, we can't provide an exact sum. If you provide the June value, I'd be happy to help you with the calculation!"	500
132	Pam and Fred went to a ticketing convention. Pam walked around the block twice, Fred did it four times. Eventually, one of them said that he had made two tickets. If each ticket came with 6 tickets, how many of the tickets were used?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi (Let me calculate)... Pam walked around the block twice, Fred did it four times. That's a total of 2 + 4 = 6 times. If each time they walked around the block, they got 6 tickets, that's 6 x 6 = 36 tickets. But one of them said they made 2 tickets, so they used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.

Kuyafana ukuthi (So, it means) 12 tickets were used.

133	Altine, Walt walked 4 kilometers. In fact, he walked four times more than he ever walked altine. The distance between Altine and the city is 41 kilometers. How many kilometers did Walt walk altine?	13	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down. Walt walked 4 kilometers, which is four times more than he walked to Altine. So, if we divide 4 by 4, we get 1 kilometer, which is the distance Walt walked to Altine. 

Now, the distance between Altine and the city is 41 kilometers. To find the distance Walt walked to Altine, we subtract 1 kilometer from 41 kilometers. 

41 - 1 = 40 kilometers 

So, Walt walked 40 kilometers to Altine. 

In isiZulu, that's: UWalt uhambe izi kilomitha ezi-40 kuAltine!"	40
134	Tom showered 4 times a month. If a shower cost him $15, how much would it cost him a year?	720	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicabanga ukuthi... (Let me think...)

Uma Tom ubhukuda ngamahora amane emenyuzini, ngabe uyabhukuda ngamahora angu-48 emnyakeni (4 x 12 = 48). Uma ibhukudu liyimali engu-$15, ngabe liyimali engu-$720 emnyakeni (48 x $15 = $720).

Kusho ukuthi Tom uyabhukuda ngamali engu-$720 emnyakeni. (So, Tom will spend $720 in a year.)"	720
135	On Brian's map, Bobby has 5 video cameras, which is three times as many as Brian's video cameras. If Brian has 20 video cameras, but he has 5 damaged video cameras, now how many does Bobby have?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If Bobby has 3 times as many video cameras as Brian, and Brian has 20 video cameras, then Bobby has 20 / 3 = 6.67 (but we can't have a fraction of a camera, so) Bobby has 6 video cameras initially.

The problem states Bobby has 5 video cameras, so we'll go with that.

Now, Brian has 20 video cameras, but 5 are damaged, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 working video cameras.

But the question asks about Bobby's video cameras, and that hasn't changed: Bobby still has 5 video cameras.

In Zulu, we can say: ""Bobby unezicamera ezinhlanu."" (Bobby has five cameras.)"	5
136	The rest of the world's population is 27 million. About one-third of them live in an area as large as Scotland. About two-thirds of Scotland's population are women. How many of Scotland's population are women?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One-third of 27 million is 9 million (27,000,000 ÷ 3 = 9,000,000).

Since two-thirds of Scotland's population are women, we multiply 9 million by 2/3:

9,000,000 × (2/3) = 6,000,000

So, approximately 6 million women live in Scotland.

137	Rory lost two stones worth $7.50 each, two packets of chips worth $1.50 each, and two packets of cookies worth $1.00 each. The finder's fee was 20%, and Rory also lost $5.00.	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total value of what Rory lost:

2 stones = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 packets of chips = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 packets of cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total value = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Finder's fee = 20% of $20.00 = $4.00
Rory also lost $5.00, so the total loss is:
$20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

138	In the past, Marc did a 75-question test. his average was 5 questions per hour. Tay also did a 100-question test where he did the same. If Marc took 8 hours for the first test and 6 hours for the second, how many questions did he not answer?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the 75-question test, Marc's average was 5 questions per hour. He took 15 hours in total (8 hours for the first test and 6 hours for the second). So, he answered:

15 hours x 5 questions/hour = 75 questions

He answered all 75 questions.

For the 100-question test, his average was still 5 questions per hour. He took 6 hours for this test, so he answered:

6 hours x 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

He didn't answer:

100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions

So, Marc did not answer 70 questions.

Let's calculate the total cost with a 10% increase:

Bag: $2 + (10% of $2) = $2 + $0.20 = $2.20
Hat: $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Lamp: $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Cup: $3 + (10% of $3) = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Secret pocket: $4 + (10% of $4) = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Total cost: $2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $16.50

144	Kim set up a mailroom, and counted the amount of mail she could get from her clients. She had three clients, but, hoping to negotiate with five other clients, she sent her mail. Two bottles of toilet paper and a pack of mail would be able to wash each client's house. She would have to spend $2 for a bottle of toilet paper and $5 for a pack of mail. That's all. I don't know how her weekly income would be $92.	20	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for sharing Kim's story! Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 existing clients and hopes to get 5 more, making a total of 8 clients.

To clean each client's house, she needs 2 bottles of toilet paper and 1 pack of mail. So, for 8 clients, she'll need:

* 2 bottles of toilet paper x 8 clients = 16 bottles
* 1 pack of mail x 8 clients = 8 packs

The cost of the supplies is:

* 16 bottles of toilet paper x $2 each = $32
* 8 packs of mail x $5 each = $40

Total cost = $32 + $40 = $72

Since Kim's weekly income is $92, that means she'll have a profit of:

$92 (weekly income) - $72 (total cost) = $20

So, Kim's weekly profit would be $20."	20

After seeing 30 puppies leave the nest in the first 6 hours, she discovers that when another puppy leaves the nest in the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many flying puppies as the first time it left the nest. Also, in the next 6 hours, all the puppies that left and never came home are back in the nest. How many of the puppies did Debra see return to the nest in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, 30 puppies left the nest.
In the next 6 hours, when another puppy left, Debra saw twice as many flying puppies as the first time. This means there were 2 x 30 = 60 puppies flying outside the nest.
Since all the puppies that left and never came home are back in the nest, this means all 60 puppies returned to the nest.

So, Debra saw 60 puppies return to the nest in the last 6 hours of the day.

Let's break it down: The difference between the adult and child ticket is $12 - $10 = $2. Since the difference is $8, that means the adult ticket is $8 more than 4 times the difference, so $8 + 4 * $2 = $16. The child ticket is $2 less than the difference, so $8 - $2 = $6. In total, Brittany's mother gives the vendor $16 + $6 = $22.

153	Dave buys a large bag of chips, and eats nineteen of them from the hands of a crooked man. When the crooked man eats them, he destroys almost half of the chips Dave has eaten. Eventually, he is kicked out of the bag by three dogs, each of whom ends up eating three chips. After a while, a small demon steals three of the chips from the other dogs. The British take one and leave the five. How many chips were in the package when Dave got it?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* Dave eats 19 chips.
* The crooked man eats almost half of those, which is 9 chips (19 / 2 = 9.5, but we can't eat half a chip!).
* So, 19 - 9 = 10 chips left.
* Three dogs eat 3 chips each, which is 3 x 3 = 9 chips.
* 10 - 9 = 1 chip left.
* A small demon steals 3 chips from the dogs, but they didn't have any left, so this doesn't change the count.
* The British take 1 chip and leave 5.
* This means there were 5 + 1 = 6 chips left in the bag.
* Before the dogs ate, there were 6 + 9 = 15 chips.
* Before the crooked man ate, there were 15 + 9 = 24 chips.
* So, when Dave got the package, there were 24 + 19 = 43 chips.

3 hours/day x number of days (not Tuesdays and Thursdays) = 3 hours/day x 3 days = 9 hours
4 hours/day x number of days (Tuesdays and Thursdays) = 4 hours/day x 2 days = 8 hours
Total hours per week = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours in 6 months:
There are approximately 26 weeks in 6 months. So, Kimo studies:
17 hours/week x 26 weeks = 442 hours

Odi nma! (That's ""Well done"" in Igbo!) Kimo studies 442 hours in 6 months."	6
155	Every day, Bill makes 300 small loaves of bread, 120 chocolate loaves of bread, and 60 bagels of bread. Small loaves of bread, measured by the length of 4 fingers, are about the same size, chocolate loaves are about the same size, chocolate loaves are about the same size, and bagels are about 2 feet long. If Bill were to calculate the total amount of bread he makes for the entire company, how big would it be?	280	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* Small loaves: 300 loaves x 4 fingers/loaf = 1200 fingers
* Chocolate loaves: 120 loaves x 4 fingers/loaf (assuming same size as small loaves) = 480 fingers
* Bagels: 60 bagels x 2 feet/bagel x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's convert everything to inches:
* 1200 fingers x 3 inches/finger (approx.) = 3600 inches
* 480 fingers x 3 inches/finger (approx.) = 1440 inches
* We already have bagels in inches: 1440 inches

Add them up: 3600 + 1440 + 1440 = 6480 inches

So, the total amount of bread Bill makes would be approximately 6480 inches long.

156	In order to sustain the wild bananas, the caretaker must harvest bananas from a nearby field every 2 months. If there are 200 bananas for small bananas, 400 for small bananas and 100 for large bananas, how many must be harvested in 2 months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola inani lezithelo zobanana ezifunyanwa ngomhlali ngonyaka? (Do you want to know the total number of bananas to be harvested by the caretaker in 2 months?)

157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run 15 laps. We decide to do it in a 100-yard football game. Blake runs 15 laps, Kelly runs one and then announces that he doesn't want to run next to Blake. He starts running back and forth around the 40-yard line. He does it 34 times. How many chances does the winner have over the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Blake runs 15 laps, which means he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs 1 lap, which is 100 yards, and then runs back and forth around the 40-yard line 34 times. Since he's running back and forth, he covers a distance of 2 x 40 = 80 yards each time. So, he covers a total distance of 1 x 100 + 34 x 80 = 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

The winner is Kelly, and he has 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards more than Blake. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, Kelly has 1320 x 3 = 3960 feet more than Blake.

So, the winner has 3960 chances over the loser.

158	Raphael went shopping for school supplies. he bought 4 bicycles worth $1.5 each, 2 shoes worth $4 each and a house worth $20. how much did Raphael spend for this?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much Raphael spent:

4 bicycles x $1.5 each = $6
2 shoes x $4 each = $8
1 house x $20 = $20

Total amount spent = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Raphael spent thirty-four dollars. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	34
159	Finn observes 11 tetras floating in the lake. If he sees 6 of them emerge from an ice shelf, then he has to hide two of them in the ice. How many tetras can Finn now see in the lake?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Finn anabona 11 tetras ekuleni. Ukubonga, waabona 6 kwaba yi-ice shelf, wafisa ukuphinda 2 ekuleni. Kuyaphi ukuthi Finn angabona tetras ekuleni?

(Translation: Finn saw 11 tetras in the lake. Later, he saw 6 of them emerge from the ice shelf, and he had to hide 2 in the ice. How many tetras can Finn see in the lake now?)

Ukucopheleleyo: Finn anabona 11 - 2 = 9 tetras ekuleni.

160	There is a pool of water 17 feet deep at the bottom. On the top, there is another 7 feet of water. The average water depth is about 2/3 of the average water depth. What is the average water depth on the bottom of the pool?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi kwesigcawu siyisi-17 feet. Kusasa, kukhona amanzi angu-7 feet. Ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi kwesigcawu kuyisi-2/3 ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi.

Ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi kwesigcawu kuyisi- (17 + 7)/2 = 12 feet.

Ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi kuyisi-2/3 * 12 = 8 feet.

Ngithola ukuthi ukuvuleka kwamanzi ngaphakathi kwesigcawu siyisi-8 feet. (I find that the average water depth on the bottom of the pool is 8 feet.)

161	Anakin and Locsin went to sea together. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 hippopotamuses and 3 species of fish. Locsin caught 5 starfish more than Anakin, 3 hippopotamuses more than Anakin and 2 species of fish more than Anakin. How many fish did they both catch?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Anakin caught 3 species of fish.
Locsin caught 2 species more than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 species of fish.

Together, they caught 3 + 5 = 8 species of fish.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	8
162	If a $20 bag costs 20% more every two months to store, how much does a $36 bag cost?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down. If a $20 bag costs 20% more every 2 months, that means it increases by $4 every 2 months (20% of $20 is $4).

To find the cost of a $36 bag, we need to calculate the increase in percentage terms. Since the $20 bag increases by $4, the percentage increase is $4/$20 = 0.2 or 20%.

Now, let's apply this 20% increase to the $36 bag. 20% of $36 is $7.20. So, the $36 bag will cost $36 + $7.20 = $43.20.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	43
163	a number of dolls are displayed in a room: 5 red dolls, 3 dolls and a doll. the doll is worth 3 dolls, one red doll is worth $4. if it is clear that a doll is worth $5, how much will it cost to buy all the dolls?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

We have:
* 5 red dolls
* 3 dolls
* 1 doll (which is worth 3 dolls)

Since 1 doll is worth $5, and 1 doll is worth 3 dolls, that means 1 doll is worth $5, so 3 dolls are worth $15.

Now, let's calculate the total value of all the dolls:
* 5 red dolls = 5 x $4 = $20
* 3 dolls = $15 (as we calculated earlier)
* 1 doll (worth 3 dolls) = $15

Adding all together, we get: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

So, it will cost $50 to buy all the dolls!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	50
164	Jackie wonders if she should publicize her wealth or hire a copywriter. If she does it herself, she will be able to do 3 menial jobs, which can cost her $35 an hour. The copywriter asks for $90. how much will she earn in addition to her salary if she hires the copywriter?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If Jackie does it herself, she'll do 3 menial jobs at $35/hour, so she'll earn 3 x $35 = $105.

If she hires a copywriter for $90, she'll earn $105 - $90 = $15 more than her salary.

So, she'll earn $15 in addition to her salary if she hires the copywriter.

166	Sandra's neighbor gave her a 9-cent piece of paper every time she handed it to her daughter. To make a mistake in español. Sandra needed 3 coins. If we had made her a 15-cent piece of paper with a password for their school's computer. how many times would she have handed it to the kid?	5	"Ndi Igbo ka m ji! (That's ""Let me explain"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Sandra needs 3 coins to make 15 cents. Since each coin is 9 cents, let's divide 15 by 9:

15 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder of 6

So, Sandra would need 1 coin plus 6 more cents. Since each coin is 9 cents, she would need to receive the 9-cent piece of paper 1 whole time and 6/9 of another time. To find out how many times she would need to receive the paper, add 1 (whole time) and 6/9:

1 + 6/9 = 1.67 times

So, Sandra's neighbor would need to hand the 9-cent piece of paper to her daughter approximately 1.67 times."	1
167	Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, they will be 28 years old. What is Seth's age?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Let Brooke's current age be x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x.

In two years, they will be 28 years old, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 14 (Brooke's age in 2 years)
2x + 2 = 14 (Seth's age in 2 years)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 (Brooke's current age)
2x = 24 (Seth's current age)

So, Seth is currently 24 years old.

Let's break it down:

* A Western restaurant costs $25 x 3 = $75
* A restaurant that's half the price of a Western would be $75 ÷ 2 = $37.50

So, the restaurant that's half the price of a Western costs $37.50.

Let's count the legs, my friend!

80 lizards with 8 legs each = 80 x 8 = 640 legs

173	Jessica's monthly mortgage payment is $300 a month, her credit card is $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wanted to pay off the other 50% of her mortgage, how much would she have to pay in five years?	18000	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Jessica's monthly expenses:
- Mortgage: $500
- Credit card: $200
- Other mortgage payment: $300

Total monthly expenses: $500 + $200 + $300 = $1000

To pay off 50% of her mortgage in 5 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay:

Current mortgage: $500/month
50% of mortgage: $500/2 = $250/month
Total amount to pay in 5 years: $250/month × 12 months/year × 5 years = $15,000

So, Jessica would need to pay $15,000 in 5 years to pay off 50% of her mortgage.

174	Billy cooks and cuts potatoes for his brother's big barbecue. As an important event, he has 60 potatoes to cook. The potatoes are quick enough, so the time to cook them and cut them is the same. Billy needs about the same amount of chicken and shrimp to cook the potato, but 5 pieces of chicken to cut it. How much time does Billy need to make the potato?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Ukuba ukudla kwabaBilly kuyinto ekubonga kakhulu, futhi unezindlela ezinhlanu zokudla kwesikhathami. Ukudla kwesikhathami kuya ngokufanayo nekuqoka, kepha ukudla kuya ngokwesikhathami esingena ngamaphesenti angu-60. Ukudla kwesikhathami kuya ngokwesikhathami esingena ngamaphesenti angu-60, futhi ukudla kwesikhathami kuya ngokwesikhathami esingena ngamaphesenti angu-5.

Now, let's calculate the time Billy needs:

Time to cook potatoes = 60
Time to cut potatoes = 60
Time to cook chicken and shrimp = 60 (same as cooking potatoes)
Time to cut chicken = 60 + 5 = 65

Since cooking and cutting potatoes take the same time, we add them together: 60 + 60 = 120. Then, we add the time to cook and cut chicken and shrimp: 120 + 65 = 185.

So, Billy needs 185 units of time to make the potato."	185
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. So each of us spends $3 on mangoes and $2 on sugar. We have 20 months of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 each month. If we make a bond of $25, how much will it cost to buy the mangoes?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they make from selling lemonade:

20 months x $0.50 each = $10

They also make a bond of $25, so the total amount of money they have is:

$10 + $25 = $35

They spend $3 on mangoes and $2 on sugar, so the total amount they spend is:

$3 + $2 = $5

To find out how much it will cost to buy the mangoes, we subtract the amount they spend on sugar from the total amount of money they have:

$35 - $5 = $30

So, it will cost $30 to buy the mangoes.

177	Zaid used 1/4 of his salary to pay for his apartment, 1/3 to pay for his wife and then gave it to his favorite charity fundraiser. He gave $200 to his daughter for her weekly medical expenses, and then $700 to his wife for toiletries and other household items. Since Zaid earns $6,000 a month, would you ask him to pay for the wedding and then give him all of that and everything else?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for sharing Zaid's story. However, I think there might be some confusion. Zaid has already allocated his salary to different expenses, and it seems like he's taken care of his priorities.

Let me try to break it down in isiZulu:

* 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500 for his apartment
* 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000 for his wife
* He gave $200 to his daughter for medical expenses
* He gave $700 to his wife for toiletries and household items

That's a total of $4,400 already allocated. If we subtract that from his monthly salary, he's left with $1,600.

While it's kind of you to offer, I don't think it would be fair to ask Zaid to pay for the wedding on top of his existing expenses. Perhaps we could explore other options or contributors for the wedding expenses?

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Izindleko zokubonga ukuba isahluko senziwa ngaphezulu kwe-3 kubhekene nesahluko esingakwazi ukuba senziwe ngamadigiti amabili angaphambili.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

There are 6 possible outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

The outcomes greater than 3 are: {4, 5, 6}, which is 3 outcomes.

The outcomes without at least two consecutive digits are: {1, 3, 6}, which is 3 outcomes.

So, the probability of a die having a value greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of a die not having at least two consecutive digits is also 3/6 = 1/2.

The answer is: 1/2."	2

Hmmm... let me think for a sec... 

Jenna harvested twice as many apples as her mother, and her mother had 20 apples. So, Jenna had 2 x 20 = 40 apples.

* Russell has 10 hamsters, each getting 5 pieces of grass, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of grass.
* There's a rule to distribute 20 pieces of grass, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of grass so far.
* In total, 160 pieces of grass are distributed, so we subtract what we've used so far: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of grass left.
* Since each animal gets 6 pieces of grass, we divide 90 by 6: 90 ÷ 6 = 15 animals.
* Each animal is weighed in 3 cups, so we multiply 15 animals by 3 cups: 15 x 3 = 45 cups.
* Now, we need to find the pieces of grass in each cup. We know there are 90 pieces of grass left, and 45 cups. So, we divide 90 by 45: 90 ÷ 45 = 2 pieces of grass in each cup.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 2 pieces of grass in each cup."	2
187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. We're approaching a 2% interest rate. If Mandy can pay off that money in 3 months, how much should Benoit pay?	106	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Benedict uyafuna ukuthola imali eyi-$100. Une-2% interest rate. Uma Mandy angabonga imali leyi mizuzu eyi-3, Benedict kufanele abhadale imali eyi-$102."	102
188	a salesman buys bags from a farmer for $20 each. If you take a bag from the farm to the store for $2, and all the bags are sold for $30 each to get a bonus of $400, how many bags do you sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

The salesman buys bags from the farmer for $20 each.
He takes a bag from the farm to the store for $2, so the total cost is $20 + $2 = $22.
The bags are sold for $30 each.

Let's say the number of bags sold is x.

The total revenue is $30x.
The total cost is $22x.

The bonus is $400, which means the profit is $400.

We can set up the equation: $30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get: $8x = $400

Dividing both sides by $8, we get: x = 50

So, the salesman sells 50 bags!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"	50
189	three friends spent $20, $25 for three meals to go to a business meeting. we also spent $4, $50 on food. that's less than we spent on meals. we also made two bags of manicures for $33 each. if we're right about the distribution of bags in the middle, how much will each of us make?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the expenses:

* Meals: $20 + $25 = $45
* Food: $4 + $50 = $54 (this is more than the meals, not less, but let's continue)
* Manicures: 2 bags x $33 = $66

Total expenses: $45 + $54 + $66 = $165

Since there are three friends, let's divide the total by 3:

$165 ÷ 3 = $55

Each friend will make $55.

Ngubonga! (Thank you!)"	55

191	Chickens need to eat 3.5 kilos of coconut per week to survive. how many kilos of coconut does a flock of 10 chickens need?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi: 3.5 kilo zika-coconut ngeweek, ngoba izinkukhu ezinhlanu (10) ziyafuna i-35 kilo zika-coconut ngeweek.

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. He also prunes 2 trees a year. He started with 50 trees. In 10 years, 30% of the trees died. How many trees are left?	91	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he'll have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees.

He also prunes 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he'll have pruned 2 x 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, he had 50 trees. After planting and pruning, he'll have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees died, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.

So, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"	91
193	Sue lives in a very peaceful environment. Within a few hours, her neighbors convince her that she is to blame. On Friday morning, they put about 18 green coffee beans in her fridge. Late in the morning, the neighbors picked up one of the three 18 green coffee beans that we had painted white and returned to Sue's fridge. The next morning, we added another 18 green coffee beans. At 12 o'clock in the morning, how many more green coffee beans were there than white coffee beans?	24	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo yakho! (I love getting your puzzle!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 18 green coffee beans.
The neighbors picked 1 white coffee bean (out of the 3 painted white) and returned it to the fridge, so there's 1 white coffee bean.
The next morning, 18 more green coffee beans were added, making a total of 18 + 18 = 36 green coffee beans.

Now, let's count the difference between green and white coffee beans:
36 (green) - 1 (white) = 35

So, at 12 o'clock in the morning, there were 35 more green coffee beans than white coffee beans.

Ngiyabonga ukuthola ingxoxo yakho! (Thanks for the puzzle!)"	35

199	Marc is a mathematician. He calculates the number of hours per week for two different accounting firms that have different prices. The number of hours Marc spends with Accountant B is twice the number of hours Marc spends with Accountant A. Marc averages 1,000 hours per week. If Accountant A spends 5 fifty hours per week, how much money does Marc make in a week, in fifty?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Accountant A spends 5 × 50 = 250 hours per week.
Since Marc spends twice as much time with Accountant B, he spends 2 × 250 = 500 hours with Accountant B.
Total hours per week = 250 + 500 = 750 hours.
But Marc averages 1,000 hours per week, so he spends the remaining 1,000 - 750 = 250 hours on other tasks.
Let's assume the other tasks pay the same rate as Accountant A, which is 50 per hour.
Then, Marc earns 250 × 50 = 12,500 from the other tasks.
Adding this to what he earns from Accountant A and B, his total weekly earnings are:
250 × 50 = 12,500 (Accountant A) + 500 × 50 = 25,000 (Accountant B) + 12,500 (other tasks) = 50,000.

So, Marc makes 50,000 ÷ 50 = 1,000 fifty per week."	1000

Let's calculate Jean's total earnings:

1. Bonus: $5,000
2. Previous weekly salary: $2,000
3. New weekly salary with 5% increase: $2,000 x 1.05 = $2,100
4. Total weekly salary for 51 weeks (excluding bonus week): $2,100 x 51 = $107,100
5. Add bonus to total salary: $107,100 + $5,000 = $112,100

Let's break it down:

* 10 hectares x 5 tons/hectare = 50 tons of grapes per year
* 50 tons x 2 bottles/ton = 100 bottles of wine per year

So, Josie's plantation produces 100 bottles of wine per year. Umsebenzi wakhe uyaphumelela! (Her work is successful!)"	100
203	Formas is Carl's favourite dish. Every week he makes a sandwich with a different recipe. He uses 2 slices of formas in the same recipe. He eats an omelet with a formas and a slice of bread in the same recipe for 3 days a week, which means he uses one more slice of formas than I do in the recipe. He makes a pasta dish with a large portion of formas to save a lot of food during the week. Which means he uses 8 slices of formas in his cooking. How many formas does he use?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* He uses 2 slices of formas in a sandwich every week.
* He eats an omelet with 1 slice of formas and 1 slice of bread for 3 days, which means he uses 3 slices of formas.
* He uses 8 slices of formas in his pasta dish.

In total, he uses 2 + 3 + 8 = 13 slices of formas.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Uyise 13 ukudla formas."" (He eats 13 slices of formas.)"	13

Let's break it down:

Janet had 22 white bikes and 10 black bikes, making a total of:
22 + 10 = 32 bikes

The buyer bought 6 white bike bags and 2 red bike bags. Each white bike bag makes 9 bikes, so:
6 x 9 = 54 new white bikes

Each red bike bag makes 6 bikes, so:
2 x 6 = 12 new red bikes

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's tent class. He makes six tents every six months. He doesn't accept the odds we set for their worst goal every six months. Given that in the first five tents, Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score would it take to complete, in the sixth tent, goal 93?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total score Brinley needs to reach the goal of 93.

The total score Brinley has so far is: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

To find out how much Brinley needs to score in the sixth tent, let's multiply the goal by 6 (since it's every 6 months): 93 x 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract the total score Brinley has so far from the total goal: 558 - 438 = 120

So, Brinley needs to score 120 in the sixth tent to complete the goal of 93.

Let's break it down:

Weeks 1-4: Michael runs 5 times a week at 25 km/h.
Total distance = 5 runs/week × 25 km/h × 4 weeks = 500 km

Weeks 1-3 (initially): Michael runs 2 times a week at 60 km/h.
Total distance = 2 runs/week × 60 km/h × 3 weeks = 360 km

Total kilometers Michael ran = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

207	A bag of Joe's Halloween candy contains 25 bars of chocolate and 80 apples. Each bar of chocolate is twice the size of an apple. If the bar of chocolate weighs 40 g, what is the weight of the bag of Joe's candy?	2600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 bar of chocolate = 40g
* 1 apple = 40g / 2 = 20g (since 1 bar of chocolate is twice the size of an apple)
* Total weight of chocolate = 25 bars x 40g = 1000g
* Total weight of apples = 80 apples x 20g = 1600g
* Total weight of the bag = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

So, the weight of the bag of Joe's candy is 2600g.

208	Alternatively, Rose went to buy 4 cakes in one store. However, she bought 3 times more than she bought in another store. However, she went to another store and bought there 5 times more than she bought cakes. How much did she buy in a cake in 3 days?	76	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

In the first store, Rose bought 4 cakes.
In the second store, she bought 3 times more, so 4 x 3 = 12 cakes.
In the third store, she bought 5 times more than the second store, so 12 x 5 = 60 cakes.

In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes in 3 days.

209	Two dozen packs of 12 cups cost $1,200 each. That's more than half the price of a palace dozen, which costs $6,000 each. How about a cup?	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two dozen packs of 12 cups = 24 x 12 = 288 cups

Cost of 288 cups = $1,200

Cost of 1 cup = $1,200 ÷ 288 = $4.17 per cup

Now, let's look at the palace dozen:

1 palace dozen = 12 cups
Cost of 12 cups = $6,000
Cost of 1 cup = $6,000 ÷ 12 = $500 per cup

So, one cup from the palace dozen costs $500, and one cup from the two dozen packs costs $4.17.

210	Sarah wants to buy a new vest and 2 pairs of shoes. The vest she chooses is worth $30 and the pair of shoes are worth $20. Sarah works at her neighbor's house 4 times a week, earning her $5 a day. Her parents give her $4 every time she makes a dress with a wig. If Sarah saves $10 she'll start a baby shower. How much does a dress with a wig cost to buy a vest and shoes?	10	"Jambo! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Sarah needs $30 for the vest and 2 pairs of shoes, which will cost 2 x $20 = $40. So, in total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70.

She earns $5 a day by working at her neighbor's house 4 times a week, which means she earns $5 x 4 = $20 a week.

To save $10, she needs to work for $10 / $20 = 0.5 weeks.

Now, let's calculate how many dresses with wigs she needs to make to earn the remaining amount. She needs $70 - $10 = $60. She earns $4 for each dress with a wig, so she needs to make $60 / $4 = 15 dresses with wigs.

In Swahili, ""kijani"" means ""green,"" and I hope Sarah's plans are greenlit with her hard work and savings!

211	Jerry hunts a tiger. Red tigers hunt three tigers a day, white tigers hunt five a day. Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day. If the number of white tigers is more than the number of red tigers, how many red tigers are there?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day. White tigers hunt 5 tigers a day, and red tigers hunt 3 tigers a day. Since the number of white tigers is more than the number of red tigers, let's assume there are x white tigers and y red tigers.

The total number of tigers hunted is 42, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 3y = 42

Since there are more white tigers, let's try x = 6 (which means there are 6 white tigers). Then:

5(6) + 3y = 42
30 + 3y = 42
3y = 12
y = 4

So, there are 4 red tigers!

The circumference of the circle is 2 × π × radius. Since the curve is 1.5 meters, the radius is 1.5 meters. So, the circumference is approximately 2 × 3.14 × 1.5 = 9.42 meters.

To find the time, we divide the circumference by Gary's walking speed: 9.42 meters ÷ 3 meters/hour = 3.14 hours.

Uzothatha izikhathi ezizayo zonke ezi-3.14! (It will take him approximately 3.14 hours!)"	3
213	At the one-dollar store, Sloane had 100 customers come in. The next day, there were 50 more customers than the previous day. If on the third day the number of customers was 500, how many customers did she lose that day?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Day 3: 500 customers

To find out how many customers she lost, subtract the number of customers on Day 2 from Day 3: 500 - 150 = 350

So, she gained 350 customers on Day 3. To find out how many she lost, subtract the gain from the total: 500 - 350 = 150

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uthole 150 abantu."" (She lost 150 people.)"	150
214	There are two reservoirs, both of which have a source of polluted water, and each of them receives 4 cubic meters of water. During the passage of 4 cubic meters, the volume of the larger reservoir is equal to the volume of the smaller reservoir. Here, it is equal to 4. What is the volume of the smaller reservoir now?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokuthola ukuthola ukuphendula kwami. (Let me try to get the answer for you.)

Let's break it down:

* The larger reservoir receives 4 cubic meters of water, and its volume becomes equal to the smaller reservoir.
* This means the larger reservoir had 0 cubic meters initially, and the smaller reservoir had 4 cubic meters initially (since they become equal after adding 4 cubic meters to the larger one).
* Since the larger reservoir now has 4 cubic meters, and the smaller reservoir had 4 cubic meters initially, the smaller reservoir now has 4 + 4 = 8 cubic meters.

Kuyafana ukuthi i-smaller reservoir inowama 8 cubic meters. (So, the smaller reservoir now has 8 cubic meters.)

215	Lori is willing to pay $32,000 for a pair of shoes and $32,000 for a pair of jeans. Her salary is $8.00 per hour. How many hours does she have to work to pay for these shoes?	44	"Kambole! (That's ""okay"" in Lingala, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo.)

Let's calculate how many hours Lori needs to work to pay for the shoes and jeans.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of jeans = $32,000 + $32,000 = $64,000

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, she needs to work:

Number of hours = Total cost ÷ Hourly wage = $64,000 ÷ $8.00 = 8,000 hours

216	Janet owed $2,000 and then promised to pay back 10% of what she owed. If she owed $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi Janet wayeyindleko $2,000, futhi wacela ukubuyisela 10% yokuthola kwakhe. Uma wayeyindleko $165 ngomzuzu kuze kube 12 amazuzu, Janet izoba nezimali ezingaki ezisele?

(Translation: I understand that Janet owed $2,000 and promised to pay back 10% of what she owed. If she owed $165 per month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?)

Let's calculate:

10% of $2,000 = $200 (initial payment)
Janet pays $165/month for 12 months = $165 x 12 = $1,980
Total amount paid = $200 + $1,980 = $2,180
Janet initially owed $2,000, so she would have:
$2,000 - $2,180 = -$180 (Janet would be in debt by $180)

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money left over, let's assume the question means ""how much would Janet still owe?"" In that case, the answer would be $180.

219	Naomi scored 68. Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi's average, and Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi's average. To find Naomi's average, we divide 68 by 1 (since it's a single score): 68 ÷ 1 = 68. So, Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.

Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi. That's 68 + 17 = 85 points.

But wait, there's no information about Jojo's score! We can't determine Jojo's score with the given information.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question, though!"	85
220	Sister Carmen did 10 puzzles to end a sentence (it's a poem), 5 puzzles for a Sudoku poem. Between a chicken and a bear, she traveled 3 different languages and 8 different Sudoku languages. How many hours did she spend on these puzzles?	70	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I love solving puzzles!)

Let's break it down:

* 10 puzzles to end a sentence (poem) = 10 hours
* 5 puzzles for a Sudoku poem = 5 hours
* She traveled 3 different languages and 8 different Sudoku languages, but this doesn't give us a specific time, so we'll ignore it for now.

Adding the hours, Sister Carmen spent 10 + 5 = 15 hours on these puzzles.

221	A water tank produces 120 litres of water. Céline uses 90 litres to water the parched garden. She then collects twice as much rainfall. How many litres of water is left in the tank now?	90	"Nkɔ̀kɔ̀! (Ahaha!) 

Let's break it down, my friend! 

Initially, the tank has 120 litres of water. Céline uses 90 litres, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 litres.

Then, she collects twice as much rainfall as the 90 litres she used, which means she collects 90 x 2 = 180 litres.

Now, add the 30 litres left in the tank to the 180 litres collected: 30 + 180 = 210 litres.

So, there are 210 litres of water left in the tank now!

222	Andy has planted 90 geraniums and 40 petaniums in addition to the geraniums . How many of these beautiful trees has he planted in total ?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inkomba yalokho. (Let me help you with that.)

UAndy uyaphakama amageranium angu-90, futhi uyaphakama amapetanium angu-40. (Andy has planted 90 geraniums and 40 petaniums.)

Ukuthola inkomba yalokho, sizokuvumela inani lama-geraniums namapetanium. (To get the total, we will add the number of geraniums and petaniums.)

Inani lama-geraniums ngu-90, inani lama-petaniums ngu-40. (The number of geraniums is 90, the number of petaniums is 40.)

Ukuthola inkomba yalokho, sizokuvumela inani lama-90 namama-40. (To get the total, we will add 90 and 40.)

Inani lama-90 + inani lama-40 = inani lama-130. (90 + 40 = 130.)

Kutheni uAndy uyaphakama amathende angu-130. (Therefore, Andy has planted 130 trees.)

Let's calculate the amount of money they make:

Carlos rents an office for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he makes:
30 x 3 = $90

Benji rents a big boat for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he makes:
18 x 5 = $90

Together, they make:
90 + 90 = $180

226	James collects Pokémon cards. There are 30 of them from indigenous peoples, 20 from herb-speaking peoples and 40 from water-speaking peoples. If he loses 8 of the water-speaking peoples and then buys 14 of the herb-speaking peoples, what is the probability that he chooses, without thinking, a water-speaking peoples?	33	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, James had:
30 cards from indigenous peoples
20 cards from herb-speaking peoples
40 cards from water-speaking peoples

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water-speaking peoples cards, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 water-speaking peoples cards left

Then, he buys 14 more herb-speaking peoples cards, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 herb-speaking peoples cards

Total cards now = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Probability of choosing a water-speaking peoples card = Number of water-speaking peoples cards / Total cards
= 32 / 96
= 1/3

So, the probability is 1/3 or approximately 0.33.

227	When he was young, Chad bought a burrito. The burrito cost 6,50 §. He added meat costing 2 §, 1,00 § cheese, 1,00 § avocado and 2 sausages costing 0,25 § sausage. He chose the best price, which was more than 3,00 §, so he could add some fries and a snack. He received a 5,00 § complimentary card upon completion of the purchase.	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's purchase in Zulu:

* Burrito: 6,50 §
* Meat: 2 §
* Cheese: 1,00 §
* Avocado: 1,00 §
* Sausages: 2 x 0,25 § = 0,50 §
* Total: 6,50 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0,50 = 11,00 §

Since the total cost is more than 3,00 §, Chad can add fries and a snack. He also receives a 5,00 § complimentary card.

228	Kalinda tries to solve a 360-degree puzzle with her mother. She can put 4 pieces of the puzzle together. Her mother puts a new piece together twice each time. How long does it take to put the puzzle together?	1	"Nkosi! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuphakama kwephezu!"" (Let's calculate the puzzle's completion time!)

Kalinda puts 4 pieces together, and her mother adds 2 pieces each time. So, the total pieces added per round are 4 + 2 = 6.

To complete a 360-degree puzzle, they need 360 / 6 = 60 rounds.

Therefore, it will take 60 rounds to put the puzzle together.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kuphela! Ukuphakama kwephezu kuya ngama-rondi ayisihlanu!"" (That's it! The puzzle will be complete in 60 rounds!)"	60
229	Ashlyn went to the farm for two months. She found that about 30% of the chickens we had raised were able to be weaned, so she took them home. When she returned, two weeks later, she weaned the rest of the chickens, which was 3/4 of the chickens we had raised. How many of the chickens hadn't been weaned for two weeks?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of chickens is x.

Ashlyn took 30% of the chickens home, which means she took 0.3x chickens.

When she returned, she weaned 3/4 of the chickens, which is 0.75x chickens.

Since she already took 0.3x chickens, the remaining chickens that were weaned are 0.75x - 0.3x = 0.45x chickens.

So, the chickens that hadn't been weaned for two weeks are x - 0.45x = 0.55x chickens.

To find the exact number, we need to know the total number of chickens, x. But we can express the answer as 0.55x.

230	Marc bought 12 sets of shoes for his company's offices. Each pair was worth 20000§. He paid the shoes 10% of the leempo, and added another 1000 § for each pair of shoes. How much did it all cost?	276,000	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let me calculate that for you.

First, let's find 10% of 20000§, which is 2000§. Then, add 1000§ to that, making it 3000§ per pair. Since there are 12 pairs, the total cost is 12 x 3000§ = 36000§.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Izindleko zonke ziyahluka kwi-36000§."" (The total cost is 36000§.)"	36000
231	Kylie and Robert are constantly making cookies in the kitchen. Altogether, Kylie has made 5 more cookies than Robert. Robert has 20 more cookies. For example, Kylie's cookie count is twice as high as his cookie count. How many cookies does Kylie make?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Robert has 20 more cookies than some number, say x. So, Robert has x + 20 cookies.

Kylie has 5 more cookies than Robert, so Kylie has (x + 20) + 5 cookies.

Since Kylie's cookie count is twice as high as Robert's, we can set up the equation:

2(x + 20) = (x + 20) + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 40 = x + 25

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

x + 40 = 25

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives:

x = -15 (but this can't be, since you can't have a negative number of cookies!)

Let's try again. Since Kylie has 5 more cookies than Robert, we can set up the equation:

Kylie's cookies = Robert's cookies + 5

We know Kylie's cookie count is twice as high as Robert's, so:

2(Robert's cookies) = Robert's cookies + 5

Let Robert's cookies be x. Then:

2x = x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

x = 5

So Robert has 5 cookies. Since Kylie has 5 more cookies than Robert, Kylie has:

5 + 5 = 10 cookies

Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!) Kylie makes 10 cookies!"	10

234	Steve wants to eat more tomatoes, so he decides to eat tomatoes and cherries. His diet consists of twice his normal diet of 6 per day. If it is assumed that one tomato will produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many tomatoes will it take?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Steve wants to eat twice his normal diet of 6 tomatoes per day, so he'll eat 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes per day.

Since one tomato produces 3 tomatoes per week, we need to find out how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, Steve will eat 12 tomatoes per day for 7 days, which is 12 x 7 = 84 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many tomatoes it will take to produce 84 tomatoes per week, we can divide 84 by 3, since one tomato produces 3 tomatoes per week.

84 ÷ 3 = 28

So, it will take 28 tomatoes to produce 84 tomatoes per week.

Johnny started with $20 and added $10, making it $30.

Let's break it down:

Marie was married to Jessa for 10 years, and Jessa is currently 20 years old. That means Jessa was 20 - 10 = 10 years old when they got married.

Since Marie was also married to Jeanne for 2 years, we can assume Marie is also around the same age as Jessa, which is 20 years old.

So, Marie and Jessa are both 20 years old, and Jeanne's age is not specified."	20

246	Jeanne was paid $250 per hour by her director. She needed a professional director for one of her films, which took her 6 hours a day. She had to do it 4 times a week. The film lasted 5 weeks. When the film was finished, the director reduced Jeanne's salary by 10% because of the limitations of her work.	27000	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Jeanne worked 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. That's a total of:

6 hours/day × 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
24 hours/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

She was paid $250 per hour, so her total earnings would be:

120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

However, her salary was reduced by 10% due to limitations in her work. To find 10% of $30,000, we can multiply by 0.1:

$30,000 × 0.1 = $3,000

So, Jeanne's salary was reduced by $3,000. To find her new salary, we subtract this amount from her original earnings:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

1. Her brother ate 5 cookies in the morning and 13 cookies in the afternoon, so he ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
2. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her brother, so she ate 2 x 18 = 36 cookies.
3. Since one cookie has 200 fruits, her brother ate 18 x 200 = 3600 fruits.
4. Sue ate 36 x 200 = 7200 fruits.
5. To find out how many fruits Sue ate more than her brother, we subtract the number of fruits her brother ate from the number of fruits Sue ate: 7200 - 3600 = 3600 fruits.

So, Sue ate 3600 fruits more than her brother. In Lingala, that's ""Sue akeli 3600 ya mafuta kuluta yandi na yeko!"""	3600
