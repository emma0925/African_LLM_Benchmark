0	Janet's chickens produce 16 eggs a day. She eats three breakfast cereals every morning, cooks four biscuits for her friends every day. She sells the rest of the eggs at the farmers' market for $2 a day for a fresh chicken. How much money does she make a day at the farmers' market?	18	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the number of eggs Janet sells:

16 eggs produced - 3 eggs for breakfast cereal - 4 eggs for biscuits = 9 eggs left

She sells 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so:

9 eggs × $2 = $18

Janet makes $18 a day at the farmers' market!

1	How many beads will each beam take up? 2 blue beads and half of the white beads.	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi una mahloni angaki. (Let me help you figure that out.)

Ukuthi una 2 beads eblue, kanti uma half of the white beads, ngizokucophelela ukuthi uma 2.5 beads. (You have 2 blue beads, and half of the white beads, let me help you that it's 2.5 beads.)

2	Josh decides to try copying a house. He buys it for $80,000 and leaves $50,000 for repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial cost = $80,000
Repair cost = $50,000
Total investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repair increases the value by 150%, so the new value is:
$130,000 x 2.5 (150% increase) = $325,000

Profit = New value - Total investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

Josh made a profit of $195,000.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	195000
3	James decides to run three runs three times a week. He runs 60 meters on each run. How many meters does he run in a week?	540	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi James uyabheda ngamathathu amahora ngalowo mvula, futhi uyabheda ngamakhulu amamitha ngalowo bheda. Kuthola ukuthi uyabheda ngamakhulu amamitha angu-60 ngalowo bheda. Ngakho, uyabheda ngamakhulu amamitha angu-60 x 3 = 180 ngalowo mvula. Futhi uyabheda ngamathathu amahora ngalowo mvula, ngakho uyabheda ngamakhulu amamitha angu-180 x 3 = 540 ngalowo mvula.

(Translation: James runs three times a week, and he runs 60 meters each time. So, he runs 60 x 3 = 180 meters each week. And he runs three times a week, so he runs 180 x 3 = 540 meters a week.)

Uyabheda ngamakhulu amamitha angu-540 ngalowo mvula! (He runs 540 meters a week!)"	540
4	Wendy feeds each of her chicks three pieces of cornmeal, which includes seeds, nuts, and vegetables that are good for their health. She feeds her chicks three different foods. In the morning, she feeds her flock of chicks 15 pieces of cornmeal, and in the afternoon, she feeds another flock of chicks 25 pieces of cornmeal. If Wendy's flock is 20 chicks, how many pieces of cornmeal will she need to feed her chicks at the last meal of the day?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Wendy feeds each chick 3 pieces of cornmeal. She has 20 chicks, so for one meal, she needs 20 x 3 = 60 pieces of cornmeal.

In the morning, she feeds 15 pieces, and in the afternoon, she feeds 25 pieces. So, she has already fed 15 + 25 = 40 pieces.

To find out how many pieces she needs for the last meal, we subtract the number of pieces she has already fed from the total number of pieces she needs for one meal: 60 - 40 = 20.

So, Wendy needs 20 pieces of cornmeal for the last meal of the day.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	20
5	Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. $5 for one window, but only 60% off for each second window. Kyler wants to buy 16 windows. How much will they cost?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1st window: $5
* 2nd window: $5 - 60% of $5 = $5 - $3 = $2
* Since the discount is for each second window, the price for the rest of the windows will be $2.
* Total cost for 16 windows: $5 (1st window) + $2 x 15 (remaining 15 windows) = $5 + $30 = $35

Kutheni? (How's that?) The total cost will be $35."	35
6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have in common if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep.

So, Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep. In total, they have 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingu-260 ezimvelo!"" (There are 260 sheep in total!)

No common sheep, though - each city has its own flock!"	260
7	Carla is caching a 200 GB file. By default, she can cache 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the cache, Windows Update forces a restart to load, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla must restart to cache from the beginning. What cache is needed to cache the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi Carla ithola ukucache ifayili elinganiselwa ku-200 GB. Ngokuqondiswa, uCarla ungacache 2 GB/ngiminithi, kodwa ngaphambi kwesikhathi esingama-40% esifike, i-Windows Update ithatha isikhathi esingama-20 amaminithi ukulanda, okuthiwa Carla kufanele aqale ngqo ukucache kusuka kuqala.

To cache the file, Carla needs to work continuously. It takes Carla to cache the 200 GB file in one go.

So, Carla can cache the file in:

8	After driving for 3 hours at a speed of 60 km/h, John turned around as he realized that he had forgotten several important things at home. He tried to get home in 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours in traffic jams. He spent the next half hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before driving for the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. At the end of the 4 hours, how far was he from home?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

First, John drove for 3 hours at 60 km/h. Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/h × 3 h = 180 km.

Then, he turned around and drove for 2 hours in traffic jams. We don't know the speed, so we can't calculate the distance.

Next, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph. We need to convert mph to km/h: 30 mph × (1 km/0.621371 mph) = 48.28 km/h. Distance = Speed × Time = 48.28 km/h × 0.5 h = 24.14 km.

Finally, he drove for 4 hours at 80 mph. Again, we need to convert mph to km/h: 80 mph × (1 km/0.621371 mph) = 128.75 km/h. Distance = Speed × Time = 128.75 km/h × 4 h = 515 km.

Now, let's add up the distances: 180 km + 24.14 km + 515 km = 719.14 km.

Since John was trying to get home, we need to subtract the initial distance from home: 719.14 km - 180 km = 539.14 km.

So, at the end of the 4 hours, John was 539.14 km away from home.

9	For the first 40 hours of work in a week, Eliza is paid $10 per hour, plus 1.2 times the overtime. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she get for the week?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukucophelela ukuthi Eliza uyasebenza imihla 45 ekuseni, futhi uyathola $10 phakathi kwezihora 40, kanti ezihora ezisebenzayo ziyathola 1.2 times overtime.

Kuthola ukuthi Eliza uyathola $10/hour x 40 hours = $400

Ukuthola ukuthi Eliza uyathola overtime yakhe ngokuthi 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Ukuthola ukuthi Eliza uyathola overtime yakhe ngokuthi 5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60

Ukuthola ukuthi Eliza uyathola ngokuthi $400 + $60 = $460

Ngithola ukuthi Eliza uyathola $460 ekuseni. (I think Eliza will get $460 this week.)"	460
10	One new program had 60 outcomes in the first month. In the second month the number of outcomes in the first month dropped three times, but in the third month it decreased by 30%. What was the total outcome of the program in three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: 60 outcomes
Month 2: 60 ÷ 3 = 20 outcomes (dropped three times)
Month 3: 20 - (20 x 30%) = 20 - 6 = 14 outcomes (decreased by 30%)

Total outcome in three months: 60 + 20 + 14 = 94 outcomes

11	Toola went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastas.She bought 3 cans of donuts for $68 each, 2 cans of biscuits for $80, and 6 cans of biscuits for $55 each.How much was the total cost?	694	"Ekuuro! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

3 cans of donuts for $68 each = 3 x $68 = $204
2 cans of biscuits for $80 = $80 x 2 = $160
6 cans of biscuits for $55 each = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos has an apple tree. It costs $90 to plant the tree. If he grows 7 apples a year, he can sell them for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years does it take before he starts making money from the apple tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial cost: $90 (planting the tree)
Annual income: 7 apples/year × $1.5/apple = $10.5/year
Annual expense: $3/year (watering and feeding)

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate how many years it takes for the total income to cover the initial cost and annual expenses.

Year 1: Income = $10.5, Expense = $3, Net = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 (still in debt)
Year 2: Income = $10.5, Expense = $3, Net = $7.5 + $10.5 - $3 = $15 (still in debt)
Year 3: Income = $10.5, Expense = $3, Net = $15 + $10.5 - $3 = $22.5 (still in debt)
Year 4: Income = $10.5, Expense = $3, Net = $22.5 + $10.5 - $3 = $30 (break-even point!)
Year 5: Income = $10.5, Expense = $3, Net = $30 + $10.5 - $3 = $37.5 (making profit!)

So, it takes Carlos 4 years to break even and start making money from the apple tree.

13	Melanie is a house-to-house saleswoman. She sold one-third of her empty space to a green house, 2 more to a red house, and the remaining half to a brown house. If Melanie had 5 empty spaces left, how many would she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 1/3 of her empty space to a green house.
She sold 2 more to a red house.
The remaining half was sold to a brown house.
She had 5 empty spaces left.

Let's assume Melanie started with x empty spaces.

1/3 of x was sold to the green house, so x - (1/3)x = 2x/3 was left.
Then, 2 more were sold to the red house, leaving 2x/3 - 2.
The remaining half was sold to the brown house, leaving 2x/3 - 2 - (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5
x/3 - 1 = 5
x/3 = 6
x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 empty spaces.

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz, and the remainder in hip-hop.	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of students in each dance style:

* Modern dance: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students
* Jazz: 25% of 20 = 0.25 x 20 = 5 students
* Hip-hop: 100% - 20% - 25% = 55% of 20 = 0.55 x 20 = 11 students

So, 4 students are enrolled in modern dance, 5 in jazz, and 11 in hip-hop.

15	A trader needs to choose between two buying plans: $5,000 worth of goods or $8,000 worth of electronics.His financial advisor predicts that the price of electronics will rise by 2.5% in the same month.If the trader chooses to make a profit at the end of the month, how much profit will it make?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukukhetha kwesikhathi sokuthenga kuyinto ekubonakalayo.""

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Initial value of electronics = $8,000
Predicted increase = 2.5% of $8,000 = $200
New value of electronics = $8,000 + $200 = $8,200

Profit = New value - Initial value = $8,200 - $8,000 = $200

So, the trader will make a profit of $200 at the end of the month.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umbono uyindlela ekutholweni kwesikhathi sokuthenga."" (The prediction is the key to making a profit in trading.)"	200

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher, and 15 hours a week as a coach, what would her salary be?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, she works 35 hours/week × 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

As a coach, she works 15 hours/week × 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Total hours worked per year = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours

Assuming a rate of R200 per hour ( Rand, the South African currency), her total salary would be:

2500 hours × R200/hour = R500,000 per year

Translation: ""Claire makes 3 egg omelettes every morning. In 4 weeks, how many eggs will she use?""

Let's calculate: 3 omelettes/day × 7 days/week = 21 omelettes/week. Since each omelette needs 2 eggs, Claire uses 21 × 2 = 42 eggs/week. In 4 weeks, she'll use 42 × 4 = 168 eggs.

19	Marisa walks the 12 miles. It takes her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If you want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) should she walk the remaining distance?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Marisa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. To get an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to cover the total distance of 12 miles in 3 hours.

She has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk. To cover this distance in 1 hour (since she's already taken 2 hours), she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uya phezuka ngamaphesenti angu-6!"" (You must hurry at a speed of 6!)"	6
20	I have 10 liters of vodka which is two thirds water, I would like to add 15 liters of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But if I pour one liter of vodka, how much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

10 liters of vodka is 2/3 water, so water content in vodka = (2/3) × 10 = 6.67 liters

15 liters of pineapple juice is 3/5 water, so water content in juice = (3/5) × 15 = 9 liters

Total water content = 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters

You pour 1 liter of vodka, which is 2/3 water, so water poured out = (2/3) × 1 = 0.67 liters

Remaining water content = 15.67 - 0.67 = 15 liters

So, in the remaining 24 liters, there are 15 liters of water.

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 years old now.
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.
Raymond was 23 years old when he had a son, so his son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

24	Kyle purchased a copy of last year's bestseller for $19.50, which was 25% off the original price.	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price.

Let x be the original price.

Since 25% off means 75% of the original price, we can set up the equation:

19.50 = 0.75x

To solve for x, divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 ÷ 0.75
x = 26.00

So, the original price was $26.00.

Let's break down the costs:

* Chicken dish: $12
* 5 cans of milk: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total cost so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
* Mary paid $50 in total, so the cost of the pizzas is: $50 - $33 = $17
* Since each box of pizzas is $8.50, Mary ordered: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizzas

Let's calculate the total amount Mishkan spent:

3 shorts x $16.50 = $49.50
3 pants x $2.50 = $7.50

27	Cynthia eats one ice cream a night. She buys a carton of 15 ice cream for $4.00 a carton. How much does she spend on ice cream after 60 days?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cynthia eats 1 ice cream per night, so in 60 days, she'll eat 60 ice creams.

Since a carton has 15 ice creams, she'll need 60 ÷ 15 = 4 cartons.

Each carton costs $4.00, so she'll spend 4 × $4.00 = $16.00.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U Cynthia uyaphakama imali engu-$16.00 emihleni engu-60."" (Cynthia spends $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days.)

3. The third friend says 25% more than the original. 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

So, their average estimate is 80.

32	John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to take care of their daily walks and chores. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. How many hours a week does it take to take care of dogs?	35	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Each dog takes 0.5 hours for daily walks and chores, and another 0.5 hours for walking and business. That's a total of 1 hour per dog per day.

John has 10 dogs, so it takes 10 dogs x 1 hour/dog = 10 hours per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so it takes 10 hours/day x 7 days/week = 70 hours per week.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	70
33	The Grech has 110 coins. The silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin. How many gold coins does Grech have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuphendula kwami. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Let's break it down:

Let the number of gold coins be x.

Since the silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin, the number of silver coins is x/30.

The total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/30 = 110

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 30:

30x + x = 3300

Combine like terms:

31x = 3300

Divide by 31:

x = 106.45

Since you can't have a fraction of a coin, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Grech has approximately 106 gold coins.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	106
34	Siobhan has 2 fewer pearls than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more pearls than half of Raymond's pearls. If Raymond has 40 pearls, how many pearls does Siobhan have?	23	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Raymond has 40 pearls. Half of that is 40 ÷ 2 = 20. Aaron has 5 more than that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 pearls. Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 pearls.

Odi nma! (That's ""It's good!"" in Igbo.) Siobhan has 23 pearls."	23
35	Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes he scores an additional 25% points. How many points did he score in total?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores an additional 25% of 4 points, which is:
4 x 0.25 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

In total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry eats 2 cookies a day. Currently 4 cookies are sold for $5.00 each. How much does a cookie cost in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 cookies a day, so in 30 days, Terry will eat:
2 cookies/day × 30 days = 60 cookies

4 cookies are sold for $5.00, so the cost of 1 cookie is:
$5.00 ÷ 4 cookies = $1.25 per cookie

So, in 30 days, the cost of cookies for Terry will be:
60 cookies × $1.25 per cookie = $75.00

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	75
37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy a video game. He has 13 sets of Legos and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many Legos do I still have in my collection?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 sets of Legos for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He has $5 left, so he had:
$195 - $160 = $35

But wait, he has $5 left, not $35. This means he spent all his money, and...

John has no Legos left in his collection!"	35
38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. The first day he runs for 3 hours and a half and the other two days. How fast does he run?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. So, he runs 60 ÷ 3 = 20 miles per day.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and a half, which is 3.5 hours. To find his speed, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes: 3.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 210 minutes.

Now, let's find his speed in miles per minute: 20 miles ÷ 210 minutes = 0.095 miles/minute.

To convert this to miles per hour, we multiply by 60: 0.095 miles/minute × 60 = 5.7 miles/hour.

So, John runs at a speed of approximately 5.7 miles per hour.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	5

Suzie's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is twice as old, so Ben's is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.

Brando's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so Brando's is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.

41	The giant Perge, perched on the summit of Mount Farbo, blew flames at anything within 1,000 feet. The golden spear, the only weapon known to have stolen the dragon, could be fired at a distance of 400 feet, where the fire could reach the dragon. But with the sapphire in its hand, the spear was three times stronger than without the gem. If so, how far away from the dragon's fire could Pauline stand and strike the golden spear again?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthi uma unesapho sesitshi, uPauline angakwazi ukuthi athethe isicoco esisodwa kusuka kwesikhathi esingama-1200 amafeet.""

Translated to English, that means: ""It's wonderful to find out that with the sapphire, Pauline could stand 1200 feet away from the dragon's fire and strike the golden spear again.""

Here's the calculation: The golden spear can be fired at a distance of 400 feet. With the sapphire, it's three times stronger, so the distance becomes 3 x 400 = 1200 feet."	1200
42	Grandma Johnson cooked five apples for the fireman's lunch. She cut each apple into eight pies and placed five pies on the dining table for the guests to serve themselves. By the end of the evening, after the guests had eaten their pies, there were 14 pies left. How many pies did each guest receive?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Grandma Johnson akha imifino 5 yamaapple ku-fireman's lunch. Wakha imifino yamaapple ngamaphesenti 8, wathatha amaphesenti 5 emenyameni yokudla ukuba abantu bakhe baphumelele. Ngekucophe, ngemuva kokuba abantu bakhe babuye baphumelele, kunezinhlelo 14 ezisalele.

Now, let's calculate:

Grandma cut 5 apples into 8 pies each, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pies in total.

She placed 5 pies on the table, leaving 40 - 5 = 35 pies.

By the end of the evening, there were 14 pies left, so the guests ate 35 - 14 = 21 pies.

Since there were 5 pies on the table initially, there must have been 21 / 5 = 4.2 pies per guest (assuming equal distribution).

So, each guest received approximately 4 pies."	4
43	According to the dietary information, one pound of potato chips has 250 calories per meal. If one pound of potato chips has 5, how many grams would you eat if you had 2,000 calories per day and had eaten 1,800 calories before?	48	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! 

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kwakudla ukudla okuhle!""

Now, let's calculate:

You need 200 calories more to reach 2,000 calories.
Each meal has 250 calories, so you need 200/250 = 0.8 meals.
Since one pound has 5 meals, you need 0.8 x 5 = 4 meals.
Each meal is 1 pound / 5 meals = 0.2 pounds.
1 pound is approximately 453.59 grams, so 0.2 pounds is 0.2 x 453.59 = 90.72 grams.

So, you would eat approximately 91 grams of potato chips."	91
44	Charlie wants to sell his cheese. He can make a total of 10 cheeses for each cheese. He sells his cheese and tomatoes for $10.00 a week. If he sells his cheese for $2.00 each, what is the net profit if he makes 20 cheeses?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Charlie makes 10 cheeses for each cheese, so if he makes 20 cheeses, he'll have 20 x 10 = 200 cheeses.

He sells each cheese for $2.00, so he'll make 200 x $2.00 = $400.00.

He sells his cheese and tomatoes for $10.00 a week, so that's his weekly expense.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total expense = $400.00 - $10.00 = $390.00.

So, Charlie's net profit is $390.00.

46	Before leaving for her job at the coffee shop, Candice put 80 pieces of paper in her bag. On the way to the store, she stopped and bought a package of Italian souvenirs; at work, she put a letter of remembrance on each of the 220 different cups of coffee. If there were 23 letters of remembrance left, how many letters of remembrance were in the package she bought?	163	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem together. Candice had 80 pieces of paper initially and used 220 at work. So, she used a total of 220 - 80 = 140 pieces from the package. Since 23 were left, the package must have had 140 + 23 = 163 pieces.

47	John buys red carbide twice as much as blue carbide. The red carbide costs 50% more than the blue carbide. He spent $200 on the blue carbide which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the blue carbide?	800	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spent $200 on blue carbide, and each costs $40, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 units of blue carbide

Since he bought twice as much red carbide, he bought:

5 units × 2 = 10 units of red carbide

The red carbide costs 50% more than the blue carbide, so it costs:

$40 × 1.5 = $60 per unit of red carbide

He spent:

10 units × $60 = $600 on red carbide

So, in total, John spent:

$200 + $600 = $800

52	Uriah's book bag is too heavy for him. He has to lift 15 pounds. His books weigh 1/4 of a pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 of a pound each. If he carries 30 books, how many toys does he have to lift?	15	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's break it down:

Uriah's book bag weighs 15 pounds.
He has 30 books, each weighing 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the books is:
30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

To find the weight of the toys, subtract the weight of the books from the total weight:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy:
7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15 toys

O di kwa! (That's ""It's okay"" in Igbo) Uriah has 15 toys."	15

Let's break it down:

On a normal day, the mechanic repairs 6 truck wheels and 4 truck wheels, earning:
6 x $60 = $360 (truck wheels)
4 x $40 = $160 (truck repairs)
Total earnings = $360 + $160 = $520

On Fridays, the mechanic doesn't repair any wheels, so earnings are $0.

The difference between the normal day and Friday is:
$520 - $0 = $520

So, on the day of high earnings, the mechanic earned $520 more.

If Marcie receives 5% of $50,000 after 20 years, that's $50,000 x 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

After 30 years, she'll receive a percentage of $50,000, which is proportional to the number of years she's worked. Since she worked 30 years, that's 30/40 = 0.75 of the full pension.

Less than 10% of half-year salary = $840 x 0.1 = $84

Alena's second-half salary = 6 months x $140 = $840
Less than 10% of second-half salary = $840 x 0.1 = $84

Total salary paid for broadcasting services = $84 + $84 = $168

So, Alena's total salary paid for broadcasting services at the end of the year would be $168, which would be taxed."	168
64	Sophia, who is considering a road trip, wants to know how far she can go with one tank of gas. After the last 100 miles, she still needs to fill up her tank with 4 gallons of gas. According to the manufacturer's contract, her car has 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia travel with one tank of gas?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank. After driving 100 miles, she needs to fill up with 4 gallons. That means she used 12 - 4 = 8 gallons to drive 100 miles.

To find out how many miles she can travel with one tank of gas, we can set up a proportion:

8 gallons / 100 miles = 12 gallons / x miles

Cross-multiply:

8x = 12 × 100

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 150 miles

So, Sophia can travel 150 miles with one tank of gas.

65	Jim spent 2 hours watching TV and then decided to lie in bed and read for half an hour. He does this 3 times a week. In 4 weeks, how many hours does he spend watching TV and reading?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 0.5 hours reading, so in total, he spends 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week, he spends 2.5 x 3 = 7.5 hours.

In 4 weeks, he spends 7.5 x 4 = 30 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	30
66	In a basketball tournament, four schools compete. Each school sends a girls basketball team and a boys basketball team. Each team has 5 players. Each school sends a coach to each team. How many players each school sends?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi iningi lezinhlangano zesikole ezine (Let me calculate the number of teams each school has)

Izinhlangano zesikole ezine ziliku-2 (Each school has 2 teams)
Izinhlangano zesikole ezine ziliku-5 amalungu (Each team has 5 players)
Izinhlangano zesikole ezine ziliku-1 umdlali wesikhungo (Each team has 1 coach)

Ngakho, iningi lezinhlangano zesikole ezine ngalinye izolo (So, the total number of players each school sends is)
2 (teams) x 5 (players per team) + 2 (coaches) = 12

Izolo, isikole sidlala ngalinye izolo 12 amalungu. (Therefore, each school sends 12 players.)

67	A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with precious stones - 175 diamonds, 35 rubies less than a diamond, and twice as many emeralds.	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the precious stones together!

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 175 - 35 = 140
* Emeralds: 2 x 175 = 350

So, the treasure chest has 175 diamonds, 140 rubies, and 350 emeralds. That's a total of 665 precious stones!

68	At Dr. Wertz's school, there are twice as many boys as girls. If there are 60 girls for every teacher and 5 students, how many teachers are there?	36	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""I understand"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

If there are twice as many boys as girls, that means the number of boys is 2 × number of girls.

We know there are 60 girls for every teacher and 5 students. So, the total number of students is 60 girls + 60 boys (since there are twice as many boys) = 120 students.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, the number of teachers is 120 students ÷ 5 = 24 teachers.

69	Belle starts with a certain amount of money. After that, for 8 weeks, she earns $5 per week. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Belle start with?	60	"Ehe, ngiyingcenga ukuthola ukuthi Belle wayeqala ngamaphesenti angaki? (Ah, let me calculate how much Belle started with?)

Belle earned $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she earned a total of $5 x 8 = $40.

If she had a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, then she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.

Kutheni Belle wayeqala ngamaphesenti ayi-60. (So Belle started with $60.)"	60

73	Sheila bought five mobile phones for $150 each for 3 months. Each unit is charged 2% interest. How much does Sheila pay per month for 3 months?	255	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total amount Sheila paid for the mobile phones:
5 phones × $150 = $750

Since there's a 2% interest charge, we'll calculate the interest:
$750 × 2% = $750 × 0.02 = $15

Now, let's find the total amount Sheila needs to pay:
$750 (initial amount) + $15 (interest) = $765

To find out how much Sheila pays per month for 3 months, we'll divide the total amount by 3:
$765 ÷ 3 = $255 per month

74	Artie has a flea market at the Farmers' Market. He sells three types of flea: yellow, black, and brown. He usually sells yellow for $2.74 a bushel, black for $1.87 a bushel, and brown for $2.12 a bushel. Artie doesn't change today so he decides to keep all his prices around the dollar. How much would Artie make if he sold 12 boxes of yellow, 9 boxes of black, and 17 boxes of brown?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Artie's sales:

Yellow fleas: 12 boxes x $2 (approx.) = $24
Black fleas: 9 boxes x $1 (approx.) = $9
Brown fleas: 17 boxes x $2 (approx.) = $34

Total sales: $24 + $9 + $34 = $67

Artie would make approximately $67.

76	Cecilia bought a new cat litter. According to her veterinarian, she will need to feed 1 litter of cat food per day for the first 180 days. After that, she will need to feed 2 litter of cat food per day for the rest of her life. If a litter of cat food contains 110 litter of cat food, how many litter of cat food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 litter of cat food per day. That's 180 litters.

After 180 days, she needs 2 litters of cat food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so she'll need 2 litters/day for 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's 2 x 185 = 370 litters.

In total, she'll need 180 + 370 = 550 litters of cat food in the first year.

Since each litter contains 110 units of cat food, she'll need 550 x 110 = 60,500 units of cat food in the first year.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	60500
77	If Raymond weighs half as much as Sarah, if Sarah weighs four times as much as David, and if Sarah weighs 400 pounds, the difference is about as much as Raymond and David weigh.	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah weighs 400 pounds.
David weighs 1/4 of Sarah, so David weighs 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond weighs 1/2 of Sarah, so Raymond weighs 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Sarah and Raymond is 400 - 200 = 200 pounds.
The difference between Sarah and David is 400 - 100 = 300 pounds.
The sum of Raymond and David is 200 + 100 = 300 pounds.

So, the difference is about as much as Raymond and David weigh. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	300
78	Vincent could buy 3 cans for $2.50 or 2 cans for $1. How much money would he save to buy 18 cans at a lower price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

3 cans for $2.50 means 1 can costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
2 cans for $1 means 1 can costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

So, buying at the lower price, 18 cans would cost 18 × $0.50 = $9
If he buys at the higher price, 18 cans would cost 18 × $0.83 = $15

He would save $15 - $9 = $6

79	John raises a dog. Delivering the dog to a groomer costs $100. The groomer, being a new customer, gives him a 30% discount. How much does the grooming cost?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Okubonga ukuthi ungumsebenzi wokugcina. (Let's do the calculation.)

Izindleko zokuqala zokuthenga ukugcina kwesokudla kusuka ku-$100. (The initial cost of delivering the dog to the groomer is $100.)

Ukugcina uthole ukubonga okungu-30%. (The groomer gives a 30% discount.)

Ukubonga okungu-30% kusuka ku-$100 kukuba $30. (The 30% discount is $30 from $100.)

Izindleko ezintsha zokugcina kusuka ku-$100 kusuka ku-$30 kukuba $70. (The new cost of grooming is $100 minus $30, which is $70.)

Kutheni ukugcina kwesokudla kusuka ku-$70. (Therefore, the grooming costs $70.)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kwakutholakala amaliti ayisithupha.""

Let's break it down:

* Each girl received 1/6 pint, which is 4L.
* Two girls received 2 x 4L = 8L.
* One young man received 1 pint, which is 6L.
* Total water given out is 8L + 6L = 14L.
* Initially, there were 24L.
* Remaining water is 24L - 14L = 10L.
* To convert to pints, divide by 4 (since 1 pint = 4L): 10L ÷ 4 = 2.5 pints.

So, kwakutholakala amaliti ayisithupha (there are 2.5 pints remaining)."	2

84	One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If they won 8 more than they lost, that means if they lost x games, they won x + 8 games.

We know they played 22 games in total. So, the number of games they lost plus the number of games they won is equal to 22.

Let's write an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. And they won 7 + 8 = 15 games!

In isiZulu, we say: ""Wadlala amagemu 15!"" (They won 15 games!)"	15

Let's break it down:

Jean goes on 4 holidays a year and has been on vacation since he was 23 years old. He is now 34 years old, so he has been on vacation for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In 11 years, he has gone on 11 x 4 = 44 holidays.

Each holiday has a t-shirt, and each t-shirt is a winter coat. So, Jean has 44 winter coats!

87	The company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a salary policy of increasing the annual salary of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie has just worked for the company for 5 years as of last December, what is her salary after three more years of service?	9360	"Sawa sawa! (Hello!) 

In Yoruba, I'll respond: ""Owo re ti o ni lati fi se iranlọwọ yi ni 600 dọla fun oṣu kan. Ọnaṣe irinṣẹ ni 10% fun oṣu mẹsan ti o ti ṣiṣẹ fun ọdun marun. Ti Sylvie ti ṣiṣẹ fun ọdun marun tẹlẹ ni Osu kejila, owo re ti yẹ ki o gba ni ọdun mẹta ti o ba ṣiṣẹ.""

Now, let's calculate: 
Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600 x 12 = $7,200. 
After 5 years, her salary increases by 10%: $7,200 x 0.1 = $720. 
New annual salary is $7,200 + $720 = $7,920. 
After 3 more years, her monthly salary will be $7,920 ÷ 12 = $660.

So, Sylvie's salary after three more years of service is $660 per month."	660

Let's break it down:

* 1/4 of 16 guests will be absent, so 16 x 1/4 = 4 guests will be absent.
* That means 16 - 4 = 12 guests will attend.
* Each guest needs a gift of $2, so the total cost of gifts is 12 x $2 = $24.
* But the Christian wants to prepare a gift of 0.75 for each guest, so the total cost is $24 x 0.75 = $18.

Kulungile! (It's okay!) The answer is $18."	18

93	Lin used to run the 400 meters two seconds faster than Gerald in the 400 meters race, but Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lin ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how fast would Gerald, with a better diet, run the 400 meters?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lin ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds.
Gerald was 2 seconds slower, so he ran it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
Gerald improved his speed by 10%, so we'll calculate 10% of 40 seconds: 40 x 0.1 = 4 seconds.
Now, subtract the improvement from his original time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

So, with a better diet, Gerald would run the 400 meters in 36 seconds.

94	The number of donkeys in a neighbourhood is less than the number of dogs and donkeys put together. If there are two dogs for every dog, how many animals are there in the neighbourhood?	348	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* The number of donkeys is less than the number of dogs and donkeys together.
* If there are two dogs for every donkey, that means the number of dogs is 2x, where x is the number of donkeys.

Let's say the number of donkeys is x. Then, the number of dogs is 2x.

The statement says the number of donkeys is less than the number of dogs and donkeys together, so we can set up the equation:

x < x + 2x
x < 3x

This means x > 0, but we know x is a positive integer (number of donkeys).

Let's try x = 1. Then, the number of dogs is 2x = 2(1) = 2.

Now, let's check if the statement is true:
1 (donkey) < 1 (donkey) + 2 (dogs) = 3

Yes, it's true! So, there is 1 donkey and 2 dogs, making a total of 3 animals in the neighbourhood.

95	Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in espionage. How many girls are not in espionage?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

2/5 of 200 fifth graders are boys, so the number of boys is:
(2/5) × 200 = 80 boys

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls is:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

2/3 of the girls are in espionage, so the number of girls in espionage is:
(2/3) × 120 = 80 girls

To find the number of girls not in espionage, subtract the number of girls in espionage from the total number of girls:
120 - 80 = 40 girls

So, there are 40 girls not in espionage.

98	Vehicles clashed on the motorway. Some vehicles passed through the first 15 minutes of the traffic closure, and then 20 more vehicles passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. 5 vehicles took the exit from the line and did not drive through the traffic closure. If there were initially 30 motorcycles on the motorway, how many vehicles passed through the traffic closure in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Kunezimoto ezinhlanu ezithwala ukuphuma emgwaqeni wesithathu sesikhathi. Kusuka kwesikhathi sesithathu sesikhathi, kunezimoto ezishumi ezinhlanu ezithwala ukuphuma. Ezimoto ezinhlanu zithathe igatsha futhi azitholi ukuphuma emgwaqeni wesithathu. Kukhona izimoto ezithathu zokugcina emgwaqeni wesithathu.

Now, let's calculate:

Initially, there were 30 motorcycles.
5 vehicles took the exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 vehicles remained.
In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 vehicles passed through.

100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a given day. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than Jerome's first friend. If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, which is 20 + (20/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + 10 = 30 times.
4. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add them up: 20 + 25 + 30 + 60 = 135 times.

So, the doorbell rang 135 times.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	135
101	Solon had to read page 4 of his Science textbook, page 20 of his Social Studies textbook, page 7 of his History textbook, and page 8 of his Geography textbook. On Monday, Solon read page 15. If he had 4 more days to finish all his reading, on average, how many pages would he need to read in a day?	6	"Nagana ka! (That's ""okay"" in Wolof, a West African language)

Let's calculate the total number of pages Solon needs to read:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39

He's already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left

He has 4 days to finish, so on average, he needs to read:

24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

Jërëjëf! (That's ""good luck"" in Wolof!)"	6
102	John likes to drink a glass of warm water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and finally one before bedtime. John does this every day of the week, but on weekends he prefers to rest and instead have a glass of soda with us. How much warm water does John drink in a week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi John uyathanda ukudla amanzi asekhishini ngokuhlwa, ngokuhlwa, ngokuhlwa, futhi ngaphambi kokulala. Uyabonga ukudla amanzi asekhishini ngalowo mgosi, kodwa ngemini yokusasa, uyathanda ukudla amanzi asoda.

Ngokusho kukaJohn, uyadla amanzi asekhishini angu-3 ngosuku, kodwa ngemini yokusasa, uyadla amanzi asoda. Ngakho, ngicabanga ukuthi uyadla amanzi asekhishini angu-15 ngalowo mgosi, ngoba uyadla amanzi asoda ngemini yokusasa. (According to John, he drinks 3 glasses of warm water a day, but on weekends, he drinks soda. So, I think he drinks 15 glasses of warm water in a week, because he drinks soda on weekends.)"	15
103	It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles from the coast to the opposite side of the country, how many minutes would it take to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, that means it takes 10/3 minutes to cover 1 mile. To cover 42 miles, it would take (10/3) x 42 minutes.

Calculating that, we get... (drumroll)...140 minutes! It would take 140 minutes to cover the entire city from coast to coast.

Siyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	140
104	Poppy is playing a game of 1000 holes. She puts a quarter of the holes in it, and then her mother puts a third of the remaining holes in it. How many holes are left?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy puts a quarter of 1000 holes, which is 1000 ÷ 4 = 250 holes.

That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 holes.

Then, her mother puts a third of the remaining 750 holes, which is 750 ÷ 3 = 250 holes.

So, the number of holes left is 750 - 250 = 500 holes.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kuneziholo ezingama-500 ezisele ukugcina."" (There are 500 holes left.)"	500
105	If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies will the two of them eat together?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uAmir uyathakatha izinkwa eziyisihlanu. Uma ungene ngowesibili, bazothakatha izinkwa eziyi-10. (I want to know that Amir ate 5 cookies. If he joins with another, they will eat 10 cookies.)"	10
106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. It has a 1 inch thick wall. What is the total of all 3 boxes?	72	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Hello!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's calculate the volume of one box first. The inner dimensions are 5 - 1 = 4 inches, 6 - 1 = 5 inches, and 4 - 1 = 3 inches. So, the volume of one box is 4 × 5 × 3 = 60 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume is 3 × 60 = 180 cubic inches.

Nno! (That's ""Okay!"" in Igbo.)"	180
107	Frank watches TV every night after he finishes his homework. On Monday and Tuesday nights, he watches his favorite one-hour program. On Tuesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. On Fridays, he watches two one-hour episodes because he can get up for the weekend. In total, he watches 7 hours of TV, so how many 30-minute episodes does he watch on Wednesdays?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Frank's TV watching habits:

* Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each = 2 hours
* Tuesday: a few 30-minute episodes = x * 0.5 hours (we'll come back to this)
* Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 hours
* Total: 7 hours

Let's add up the hours: 2 + x * 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms: 5.5 + x * 0.5 = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides: x * 0.5 = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 3

So, Frank watches 3 thirty-minute episodes on Wednesdays!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	3
108	Henry is making a cake for a national baking competition. Last year he wanted to make twice as much. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he actually baked 15 more cakes than he had thought. He leaves 5 of his cakes in the bag to freeze, and now he has a total of 110 cakes. How many cakes did Henry make last year?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Henry has 110 cakes now, but he left 5 in the bag, so he actually baked 110 + 5 = 115 cakes.

He realized he baked 15 more cakes than he thought, so he intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cakes.

Since he wanted to make twice as much last year, he must have made half of 100 cakes last year, which is 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cakes.

So, Henry made 50 cakes last year.

Ngiyabonga ukubonga! (Thank you for asking!)"	50
109	A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. An app company is offering a cash back of $20.00 per gallon if you fill the station with gas. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much gas will they have with them, after cash back?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the gas: 10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cash back is $20.00 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it's 10 x $20.00 = $200.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the cash back: $200.00 - $30.00 = $170.00

So, after cash back, the person will have $170.00, not gas, but money! They will still have 10 gallons of gas, though.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you)!"	10
110	Marcel and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most fruit in the cluster, so they interpret what they find. It is interesting that someone made a mistake: Beatrice's is 2 inches high and 24 inches long, and Marcel's is 3 inches high and 14 inches long. If they both ate as much as they wanted, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Let's calculate the area of each fruit cluster:

Beatrice's cluster: 2 inches high x 24 inches long = 48 square inches
Marcel's cluster: 3 inches high x 14 inches long = 42 square inches

Total area: 48 + 42 = 90 square inches

To find the average, divide the total area by 2: 90 ÷ 2 = 45 square inches

So, on average, they ate 45 square inches of fruit each!

113	Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his field. After 15 days if he doesn't grow 5 flowers how many flowers does he have?	25	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the number of flowers Ryan has:

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he will have:
2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers

If he doesn't grow 5 more flowers, he will still have:
30 flowers

In isiZulu, I would say: ""U-Ryan unezinhlobo ezili-30 kuze kube ngemini."" (Ryan has 30 flowers in his field.)"	30
114	Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many pictures as the British phone. The number of pictures that the British phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds that Jamal photographed at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, how many seconds would Jamal's photos at the zoo take?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many pictures as the British phone, so if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, the British phone can hold:

1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures

The British phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds Jamal photographed at the zoo, so:

300 ÷ 50 = 6 birds

Now, let's assume each photo takes 1 second (a rough estimate!). So, Jamal's photos at the zoo would take:

6 birds × 1 second/bird = 6 seconds

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	6
115	Sasha, after buying some wood, realizes that the price of the wood has gone up by 50% in the last few months. She decides to sell because she has left over. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left over, each of which she paid her $10 for. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each of which she bought for $16 each. How much profit would she make if she sold them all?	90	"Ehe, Sasha go make am! 

Odi nma, let's calculate:

For 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she paid $10 each. Now, price don increase by 50%, so new price be $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15. She get 10 boards, so total sale be 10 x $15 = $150. She paid $10 each, so total cost be 10 x $10 = $100. Profit be $150 - $100 = $50.

For 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she paid $16 each. Now, price don increase by 50%, so new price be $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24. She get 5 boards, so total sale be 5 x $24 = $120. She paid $16 each, so total cost be 5 x $16 = $80. Profit be $120 - $80 = $40.

Total profit be $50 + $40 = $90.

Sasha go make $90 profit!"	90

119	Adrienne's total salary was 30 percent more than Leah's. After four years, his salary had increased, which was 40 percent more than what he had been earning four years earlier. If Adrienne and Leah's salary had increased at the same time, and Adrienne had earned $40,000 four years earlier, what would their total salary have been four years later?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Adrienne's salary was 30% more than Leah's, so if Adrienne earned $40,000, Leah earned:

$40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769 (Leah's salary four years earlier)

Four years later, Adrienne's salary increased by 40%, so he earned:

$40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000 (Adrienne's salary four years later)

Leah's salary also increased by 40%, so she earned:

$30,769 x 1.4 = $43,076 (Leah's salary four years later)

Their total salary four years later would be:

$56,000 + $43,076 = $99,076

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 peaches, so she brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the number of apples, so he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He brought half the number of peaches, so he brought 8 ÷ 2 = 4 peaches. So Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together, they brought 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

Let's count the sausages: Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 fish sausages instead of chicken sausages, so that's 6 more fish sausages. He also needed fish sausages, so let's add those too. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't tell us how many fish sausages he bought, but we can still give an answer.

Let's break it down:

* 500 patients per day, each seen for 24 minutes = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day
* Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours per day
* Doctors charge $150 per hour, so the hospital pays 200 hours x $150 = $30,000 per day
* The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so they earn 200 hours x $200 = $40,000 per day
* Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 per day

Let's calculate the tickets:

Pam climbed the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred climbed it 4 times. So, they used 2 + 4 = 6 tickets for the roller coaster.

Then, they each tried the luge 2 times, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 more tickets.

In total, they used 6 + 4 = 10 tickets.

Since each ladder issued 6 tickets, they used 10 tickets that day.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the miles he walked on Monday, so 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

Let's break it down:

* One-third of 27 unicorns are in Scotland, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 unicorns in Scotland.
* Two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female, so that's 2/3 × 9 = 6 female unicorns in Scotland.

137	Rory orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. If the delivery charge is increased by 20%, she wants to increase it by $5.00. What does her delivery charge?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the order:

2 subs = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 chips = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Let's say the original delivery charge is x. Then, the increased delivery charge is x + 20% of x + $5.00.

We can set up an equation: x + 0.2x + $5.00 = total cost
Combine like terms: 1.2x + $5.00 = $20.00
Subtract $5.00 from both sides: 1.2x = $15.00
Divide by 1.2: x = $12.50

So, the original delivery charge is $12.50.

138	Mark took 75 out of his test yesterday. He completed the test 5 times faster than an hour. Today he completed the test 100 times faster than an hour. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unfinished?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Yesterday, Mark completed the test 5 times faster than an hour, which means he took 1 hour ÷ 5 = 0.2 hours or 12 minutes to complete the test. Since he scored 75, that means there were 75 questions in total.

Today, Mark completed the test 100 times faster than an hour, which means he took 1 hour ÷ 100 = 0.01 hours or 0.6 minutes to complete the test. Since he had 6 hours to complete the test, he could have completed it 6 hours ÷ 0.01 hours = 600 times. This means he could have answered 600 x 75 = 45,000 questions.

However, since he only had 6 hours to complete the test, he could only answer 6 hours x 75 questions per 0.2 hours = 2250 questions.

So, Mark left 45,000 - 2250 = 42,750 questions unfinished.

145	John had a 10 hectare pineapple field. There were 100 pineapples in one hectare. John could harvest his pineapples in 3 months. How many pineapples could John harvest in a year?	4000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukucophelela ngokusola (Let me calculate for you).

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, John has a total of:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest his pineapples in 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, John can harvest his pineapples:

4 times (12 months / 3 months) = 4 times

She sees twice as many canyons as she first saw flying out of the corn and leaving in the next 6 hours. Then all the canyons that went before her return to the canyon in the next 6 hours without returning. How many canyons did Debra see return to the canyon in the last 6 hours?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 canyons leave the canyon.

In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 more canyons return, which is 30 + (1/2 × 30) = 30 + 15 = 45 canyons.

Then, she sees twice as many canyons as she first saw flying out of the corn and leaving in the next 6 hours, which is 2 × 30 = 60 canyons.

Now, all the canyons that went before her return to the canyon in the last 6 hours without returning. This means all the canyons that left initially (30) and the additional ones that left later (60) return. So, the total number of canyons that return in the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 canyons.

150	Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school faster. Steve is allowed to ride his bike because he lives farther away than Tim. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can cycle 440 miles per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can skateboard 264 miles per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before finishing the race?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Steve uyaphuma emgwaqweni (Steve is cycling) at 440 miles per minute. To find the time it takes him to get home, we divide the distance (3 miles) by his speed:

3 miles ÷ 440 miles/minute = 0.0068 minutes

Tim uyaphuma esikhwameni (Tim is skateboarding) at 264 miles per minute. To find the time it takes him to get home, we divide the distance (2 miles) by his speed:

2 miles ÷ 264 miles/minute = 0.0076 minutes

Since Steve gets home faster, Tim will be the winner waiting at home. The time Tim waits is the difference between their times:

0.0076 minutes - 0.0068 minutes = 0.0008 minutes

So, the winner (Tim) will wait approximately 0.0008 minutes or 0.048 seconds at home before finishing the race.

153	Dave bought a large packet of french fries and ate fourteen, before a hungry seagull snatched the packet from his hand. When the seagull landed, he ate less than half of the french fries Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons threatened him away from the food, each eating three pieces of french fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. The rabbits took the last five french fries and left. How many french fries were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Dave ate 14 french fries.

The seagull ate less than half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 - 1 = 6 french fries.

Then, 3 pigeons each ate 3 french fries, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 french fries.

Now, let's calculate the total number of french fries eaten so far: 14 + 6 + 9 = 29.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining french fries. Let's call the total number of french fries x. Then, the remaining french fries are x - 29.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining french fries, so it stole (2/3)(x - 29) french fries.

The rabbits took the last 5 french fries, so we can set up the equation:

x - 29 - (2/3)(x - 29) = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 47

So, there were 47 french fries in the packet when Dave bought them.

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi inani eliphelele. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Ukuba inhloli ingama-20, futhi ivalue yakhe iyaphakama ngama-20% emasontweni amabili, kufanele siqonde ukuthi inani eliphelele ngale nyanga lithathu kuyindlela ethu.

(I'll break it down for you. If the coin is worth $20 and its value increases by 20% in two months, we need to find the value after 36 months.)

Ukuba iphakama ngama-20% emasontweni amabili, kufanele siqonde ukuthi iphakama ngama-10% emenyanga emibili. (If it increases by 20% in two months, we know it increases by 10% every month.)

Ngale nyanga lithathu, inani eliphelele kuyindlela ethu:

* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-20 + (20% of 20) = 20 + 4 = 24
* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-24 + (10% of 24) = 24 + 2.4 = 26.4
* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-26.4 + (10% of 26.4) = 26.4 + 2.64 = 29.04
* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-29.04 + (10% of 29.04) = 29.04 + 2.904 = 31.944
* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-31.944 + (10% of 31.944) = 31.944 + 3.1944 = 35.1384
* Emenyanga eyodwa, inhloli ingama-35.1384 + (10% of 35.1384) = 35.1384 + 3.51384 = 38.65224

Ngale nyanga lithathu, inani eliphelele kuyindlela ethu yi-38.65.

* 1 Spanish flannel needs 3 eggs.
* Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flannels.
* So, she needs 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.
* She gets 9 eggs every time she takes care of the baby.
* To find out how many times she needs to take care of the baby, divide 45 eggs by 9 eggs: 45 ÷ 9 = 5.

So, Sandra needs to take care of the baby 5 times. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	5

169	Pancho walks 20 miles a day, except on weekends when he walks 10 miles. How many miles does he walk in a week?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So, he walks:
20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles a day, that's 2 days. So, he walks:
10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

In total, Pancho walks:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week! Ukudla kwethu! (That's our food!)"	120
170	The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform has a $25 coffeemaker, a triple coffeemaker jacket, and pants that average the cost of a coffeemaker and a coffeemaker jacket. How much are each uniform worth in total?	150	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Izincwadi zokugcina ze-uniform (The total cost of each uniform is):

* i-coffeemaker: $25
* i-jacket: $25 x 3 = $75
* i-pants: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Izincwadi ze-uniform ezinhle (The total cost of each uniform is): $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Let's count the feet:

* 80 rodents x 8 feet each = 640 feet
* 90 insects x 6 feet each = 540 feet
* 3 rare mutant invertebrates x 10 feet each = 30 feet

Total feet Jake sees = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 feet

172	There are four birds on a caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is equal to Sally Thirty-two and Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old, what is the total age of the four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sally Four = Sally Thirty-two = 8 years old
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red = 2 x 8 = 16 years old
Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two = 16 + 3 = 19 years old

Now, let's add up their ages:
8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51 years.

173	Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay off all of her loans each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300 per month, her credit cards have a minimum payment of $200 per month, and her husband's loans have a minimum payment of $500 per month. If Jessica wanted to pay 50% less than that, how much would she pay off in a year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total minimum payment per month:

$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit cards) + $500 (husband's loans) = $1000 per month

If Jessica wants to pay 50% less, she'll pay:

$1000 x 0.5 = $500 per month

In a year, she'll pay:

$500 per month x 12 months = $6000 per year

174	Billie barbecues the skin of the rabbit and has a few to prepare to make the rabbit salad for his large family gathering. Because of its size, he has 60 rabbits to pass through. Since the rabbits are roughly the same size, each takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut. Billie takes about a minute and a half to peel a rabbit, but for some it only takes about 5 seconds. How long does it take to finish making the rabbit?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in Zulu:

""Ukuba ukuphela kwesikhathi sokuba Billie eseba amarabbit afana nawo, kufanele siqonde ukuthi ukuba ngamunye umrabbit uya ngemini engu-1.5, kodwa ukuba ngamunye umrabbit uya ngasekutheni lesi-5. Ukuba sekuphela kwesikhathi sokuba amarabbit ayi-60, siyacula ukuthi ukuba sekuphela kwesikhathi sowiso ukuba ngu-60 x 1.5 = 90 amaminithi.""

Translation:
""To find out how long it takes Billie to finish preparing the rabbits, we need to consider that each rabbit takes about 1.5 minutes, but some take only 5 seconds. If there are 60 rabbits, we calculate that it will take 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes.""

So, it will take Billie 90 minutes to finish making the rabbit salad."	90
175	Juan and his brother Carlos are selling a gallon of beets for $3.00 and a gallon of sugar for $2.00 each, so they sell 20 coconuts for $0.50 each. If they make $25 profit, how much do they spend on beets?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

They sell 20 coconuts for $0.50 each, so they make:
20 x $0.50 = $10

They make a total profit of $25, so they must have made:
$25 - $10 = $15

from selling beets and sugar.

Let's say they sell x gallons of beets and y gallons of sugar. Then:
3x + 2y = 15

We don't have enough information to find the exact values of x and y, but we can express x in terms of y:
x = (15 - 2y) / 3

The question asks how much they spend on beets. Since they sell beets for $3.00 each, they must have spent:
3x = 3((15 - 2y) / 3) = 15 - 2y

on beets.

Unfortunately, we can't find the exact value of y without more information. But we can express the answer in terms of y:

176	Of the 240 Asians in the tournament, 80 were Japanese and the rest were Chinese.If there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, how many girls were in the Chinese team?	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

There were 240 Asians in total, and 80 were Japanese. That means the rest, 240 - 80 = 160, were Chinese.

If there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, that means the number of girls is 160 - 60 = 100.

So, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.

177	Zayed spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and donates half of the rest to his favorite charity. $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses, and $700 for his wife's shopping and other household expenses. If Zayed earns $6,000 a month, how much money would he still have after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zayed's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
3. Total spent so far: $1,500 + $2,000 = $3,500
4. Remaining salary: $6,000 - $3,500 = $2,500
5. Donation to charity: half of $2,500 = $1,250
6. Remaining salary after donation: $2,500 - $1,250 = $1,250
7. Daughter's weekly expenses: $200
8. Wife's shopping and household expenses: $700
9. Total remaining expenses: $200 + $700 = $900
10. Final remaining salary: $1,250 - $900 = $350

Zayed would have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

178	Rani Monik has ten more crabs than Bo, who has 4 fewer crabs. If Bo has 40 craps, then calculate the total number of craps the three of them have together.	122	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Bo has 40 crabs.
Bo has 4 fewer crabs than someone, so that someone has 40 + 4 = 44 crabs.
Rani Monik has 10 more crabs than that someone, so Rani Monik has 44 + 10 = 54 crabs.

Now, let's add the crabs together:
Bo has 40 crabs.
Rani Monik has 54 crabs.
The third person (who has 44 crabs) is not mentioned by name, but we can include their crabs too.

The total number of crabs is: 40 + 54 + 44 = 138 crabs.

182	Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago Mark was half a year older than Jean by 5 years. If Jean is 30 years old, how old is Jean?	23	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let Jean's current age be J and Mark's current age be M.

We know Jean is 30 years old, so J = 30.

Two years ago, Jean's age was J - 2 = 28, and Mark's age was M - 2.

The problem states that two years ago, Mark was half a year older than Jean by 5 years. So, we can set up the equation:

M - 2 = (J - 2) + 5 + 0.5

Substitute J = 30:

M - 2 = (30 - 2) + 5 + 0.5
M - 2 = 28 + 5 + 0.5
M - 2 = 33.5
M = 35.5

So, Mark is currently 35.5 years old.

In Zulu, we can say: ""UMark usuka eminyaka engu-35.5!"" (Mark is 35.5 years old!)"	35

184	Jerry is copying a hexadecimal digit. What is the probability of copying more than 3 digits (expressed in decimals) than copying two consecutive integers?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In hexadecimal, there are 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F. The probability of copying 2 consecutive integers is 1/16 × 15/16 = 15/256.

The probability of copying more than 3 digits is 1 - (probability of copying 3 digits or less). There are 16 ways to choose the first digit, 16 ways to choose the second digit, 16 ways to choose the third digit, and 13 ways to choose the fourth digit (since it must be more than 3 digits ahead). So, the probability of copying more than 3 digits is 1 - (16/16 × 16/16 × 16/16 × 3/16) = 1 - 3/16 = 13/16.

Now, let's compare the two probabilities: 15/256 vs 13/16. The probability of copying more than 3 digits (13/16) is greater than the probability of copying 2 consecutive integers (15/256).

In decimals, the answer is: 0.8125 (13/16).

Let's break it down:

* Chickens are kept in groups of 3 tents, and each tent receives 6 grass pieces. So, the total number of grass pieces for the chickens is 3 x 6 = 18.
* Hamsters are kept in 10 tents alone, and each receives 5 grass pieces. So, the total number of grass pieces for the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

Let's calculate the interest: $100 x 2% = $2 per month. For 3 months, the interest is $2 x 3 = $6. So, Mandy should pay Benedict $100 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $106.

In isiZulu, ""Mandy kufanele aphume Benedict amakhulu angu-$106."" (Mandy should pay Benedict $106.)"	106
188	If a merchant buys a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and if the merchant sells each sack for $30 and makes a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The merchant buys a sack for $20 and transports it for $2, so the total cost is $20 + $2 = $22.

He sells each sack for $30, so his profit per sack is $30 - $22 = $8.

If his total profit is $400, then the number of sacks he sold is $400 ÷ $8 = 50 sacks.

So, the answer is: Amasaka angu-50! (The answer is 50 sacks!)"	50

If one chicken needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then ten chickens need 10 x 3.5 = 35 pounds of insects per week.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 35 pounds by 7 to get the daily need:

Let's break it down:

Tom plants 10 trees/year and cuts 2 trees/year, so he has a net gain of 8 trees/year.

In 10 years, he'll have planted 10 x 8 = 80 trees.

He starts with 50 trees, so he'll have 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.

30% of 130 trees will die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.

So, he'll be left with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one-third of the flamingos back and painted them white, and the newly painted white flamingos were put back on Sue's front porch. Then on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. By Sunday afternoon, how many more pink flamingos were out than white flamingos?	24	"Jambo! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, one-third of the flamingos were taken back, which is 18 ÷ 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back on the porch. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left, and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos. The number of white flamingos remained the same, 6.

To find the difference, subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

So, by Sunday afternoon, there were 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

Month 1: Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards initially.

Month 2: She collected 3 times that number, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards. But she collected fewer than 20 cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Total cards after Month 2: 20 + 40 = 60 cards.

Month 3: She collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the first and second months. That's 2 x (20 + 40) = 2 x 60 = 120 cards.

201	John wins a prize at his workplace. The prize consists of a one-time cash award of $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he earns $2000 per week, how much money did he earn that year if he earned the prize every week and on the first day of the year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John earns $2000 per week. With a 5% salary increase, his new weekly salary is:
$2000 x 0.05 = $100
$2000 + $100 = $2100 per week

Since he earns the prize every week, he gets an additional $5000 each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
$2100 + $5000 = $7100 per week

In a year, there are 52 weeks. So, his total yearly earnings are:
$7100 x 52 = $369200

On the first day of the year, he gets an additional $5000, making his total yearly earnings:
$369200 + $5000 = $374200

Let's break it down:

* 1 chocolate caramel weighs 40g, so 1 apple caramel weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
* There are 25 chocolates, so their total weight is 25 x 40g = 1000g.
* There are 80 apple caramels, so their total weight is 80 x 20g = 1600g.
* Add the Halloween caramel (let's assume it weighs the same as an apple caramel, 20g).

Sarah takes care of 4 children in the neighborhood, each time she takes care of a child she gets $5. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass. If Sarah saved $10 before she started taking care of the baby, how many times would she have to cut the grass before she could buy a jacket and shoes?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah wants to buy a jacket ($30) and 2 pairs of shoes ($20 each), so she needs:
$30 + (2 x $20) = $30 + $40 = $70

She already has $10, so she needs:
$70 - $10 = $60 more

She earns $5 for each child she takes care of, but we don't know how many children she'll take care of, so let's focus on cutting grass. She earns $4 for every time she cuts the grass.

To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass, divide the amount she needs by how much she earns per grass-cutting:
$60 ÷ $4 = 15

So, Sarah needs to cut the grass 15 times to buy the jacket and shoes.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers for 3 days: 100 + 150 + x = 500 (where x is the number of customers on the 3rd day)

x = 500 - 250
x = 250

214	Jerry had two barrels, each of which made 4 gallons of water per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big barrel held twice as much water as the smaller barrel. Now the big barrel holds four times as much water as the smaller barrel. How much water does the smaller barrel hold?	8	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

4 minutes ago, the big barrel held twice as much water as the smaller barrel. This means the big barrel had 2x gallons and the small barrel had x gallons.

Since each barrel fills 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the big barrel will have 2x + 4*4 = 2x + 16 gallons, and the small barrel will have x + 4*4 = x + 16 gallons.

Now, the big barrel holds four times as much water as the smaller barrel, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 16 = 4(x + 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 16 = 4x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

16 = 2x + 64

Subtracting 64 from both sides gives:

-48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by -2 gives:

x = 24

So, the smaller barrel held 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it fills 4 gallons per minute, it now holds:

24 + 4*4 = 24 + 16 = 40 gallons

Ngiyajabula ukuthola inketho! (I'm happy to have found the answer!)

The smaller barrel holds 40 gallons of water."	40

(I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has:

30 (fire) + 20 (rain) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

40 (water) - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 more rain cards, so he now has:
20 (rain) + 14 = 34 rain cards

The total number of cards now is:
30 (fire) + 34 (rain) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The probability of drawing a water card is:
Number of water cards / Total number of cards = 32/96 ≈ 0.333

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

Basic burrito = $6.50
Extra meat = $2.00
Extra bread = $1.00
Avocado = $1.00
2 pieces of salt = 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of burrito = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Enhancement (chips and drinks) = $3.00
Total cost = $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

229	One banana plant produced 120 baby bananas. Ashley went to the farm two months later and found that 30% of the bananas were ready to be harvested, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining bananas were ready, so she harvested them. After two weeks, how many bananas were not ready for harvest?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Initially, there were 120 baby bananas.

After two months, 30% were ready to be harvested. To find 30% of 120, we multiply: 120 x 0.3 = 36 bananas.

Ashley took 36 bananas home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 bananas.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining bananas were ready. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply: 84 x 0.75 = 63 bananas.

Inani leyi-car: $20,000 (Price of each car: $20,000)
Izimali ezithakazelwa: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 (Total cost: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000)
Ithakazi: 10% x $240,000 = $24,000 (Tax: 10% x $240,000 = $24,000)
Izimali eziyachithwa: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000 (Additional cost: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000)
Izimali ezithakazelwa ngokuhamba: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 (Total cost including tax and additional cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000)

Ukuthakazelwa okuphelele: $276,000 (The final cost: $276,000)

231	Kyle and Robert enjoy going to the beach and collecting seashells. On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more seashells than Robert collects 20. On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many seashells as she did on Monday.	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthi! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Kyle collects 5 more seashells than Robert, who collects 20. So, Kyle collects 20 + 5 = 25 seashells.

On Tuesday, Kyle collects twice as many seashells as she did on Monday. Since she collected 25 on Monday, she collects 25 x 2 = 50 seashells on Tuesday.

So, Kyle collects 25 seashells on Monday and 50 seashells on Tuesday."	50
232	Dax went to the orchard to gather some apples, only to find half a dozen apples in the orchard, about fifty in total.	75	"""Eyi ni ó ri ọja kan, ó ri ẹgbẹrun ọkan lẹẹkan, ó sí ní ó ri ọgbọ̀n ẹgbẹrun méjì lẹẹkan."" (Yoruba)"	-1
233	Thirty-six penguins sunbathe in the snow; one-third jump into the sea to swim; one-third hide in caves to eat their lunch; how many penguins still sunbathe?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Amapengusi ayi-36 asebhujiswa emhlabeni wenziwa; amathathu amahlanu aya emanzini ukushisa; amathathu amahlanu aya ekhaya ukudla izolo; unabantu bapengusi abaphuma bebhuji?

(Thirty-six penguins sunbathe in the snow; one-third jump into the sea to swim; one-third hide in caves to eat their lunch; how many penguins still sunbathe?)

One-third of 36 is 12. So, 12 penguins jump into the sea, and 12 penguins hide in caves.

That leaves us with: 36 - 12 - 12 = 12

Kuthola ukuthi amapengusi ayi-12 asebhujiswa emhlabeni wenziwa. (So, 12 penguins still sunbathe.)

Sawubona!"	12
234	Steve decided to start eating more tomatoes and decided to grow his own tomato cherry. Even his girlfriend eats twice as much, 6 times a day. If a vineyard can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how much wine does it need?	21	"Ewe, omo yi ko gbo! (Oh, this child doesn't understand!)

Tomatoes are not used to make wine, grapes are! So, the vineyard doesn't need any tomatoes to produce wine. The question is a bit confusing, but I hope this clears things up!"	-1
235	John orders some pizza to share with his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each of them can have 4 slices. Pizza is only sold sliced into 8 pieces. How many pizzas does it take for John to order?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi: 20 abangani bakhe bakhule 4 islice nganye, kuthiwa kufanele kube khona 20 x 4 = 80 islice.

Ipizza lihleliwe ngamaphesenti angama-8, kuthiwa kufanele kube khona 80 / 8 = 10 ipizza.

(Translation: I want to say: 20 of his friends must have 4 slices each, so there must be 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

The pizza is sold in slices of 8, so there must be 80 / 8 = 10 pizzas.)"	10
236	He used a lot of pencils. He realized that by combining five of the pencils, he could make a whole pencil. If he bought 25 pencils and used the pencils to make a new one, how many pencils would he have?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uma unezinto ezinhlanu, uzokwazi ukudala izinto eliyi-pencili. Uma unezinto ezimbalwa ezingu-25, wazidla izinto ezinhlanu ukudala izinto eliyi-pencili, uzokwazi ukuthola izinto ezili-21.

(Translation: I want to find out that if you have five things, you can make one pencil. If you have 25 things, you used five things to make one pencil, you can find 21 things.)"	21
237	John took his $20 deposit, added an additional $10 to it, and then used the money to triple his income within a year.	90	"""Oluwa lo ri, John gbe ode $20 re, o naa si $10 mo, o si lo fi owo naa se ipinle ase odun kan, o si ri ibi owo re di mẹta!"" (Yoruba language)"	10

239	If the number of students in a school is 3 A, B, and C, then 30% of the students graduate with a B, and the rest with a C.	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi 30% ukuthola A yi-3, kuyafana ukuthi yi-0.9. Kepha ukuthi abafundi abangama-3 abagraduwa ngama-B, kuyafana ukuthi yi-0.9 x 3 = 2.7. Okunye ukuthi abafundi abangama-3 abagraduwa ngama-C, kuyafana ukuthi yi-3 - 2.7 = 0.3.

(Translation: I want to find 30% of 3, which is 0.9. But since 3 students graduate with a B, it means 0.9 x 3 = 2.7. The rest of the 3 students graduate with a C, which means 3 - 2.7 = 0.3.)"	0

241	Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If Dolly and Pandora both read each other's books and theirs, how many books did they end up reading together?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Dolly unebhuku abili. Pandora unebhuku engalokhu. Uma Dolly noPandora babhala amabhuku akubo bonke, baya ngama-bhuku angamashumi amahlanu.

(Translation: Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If Dolly and Pandora both read each other's books and theirs, they ended up reading five books together.)"	-1
242	Mike had 5 co-writers in the company. He stopped writing to 2 of them. Each of them sent 2 letters a week that were 5 pages long. He replied the same. He could write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours a week did he spend writing?	3	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mike had 5 co-writers initially, but he stopped writing to 2, so he's now writing to 3 co-writers.

Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and Mike replies with the same number of letters. So, Mike writes 2 x 3 = 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes a total of 6 letters x 5 pages = 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, it'll take him 30 pages x 6 minutes = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours a week writing.

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"	3
243	Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1000 minutes. He has 15 minutes every day with his boss on the phone, and an additional 300 minutes this month with other people. If this month has 30 days, how many minutes does Jason have left?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Jason's total minutes used this month:

Daily minutes with boss = 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes
Additional minutes with others = 300 minutes
Total minutes used = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Jason's remaining minutes = 1000 (monthly plan) - 750 (total minutes used) = 250 minutes

Kusho ukuthi Jason uneemini engu-250! (That means Jason has 250 minutes left!)"	250
244	Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle received 5. Bill received twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin her full hand of fries, and then Colby received 3 fewer fries from Griffin than Kyle received. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many Ginger fries did Kyle give Griffin?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Kyle received 5 fries.
2. Bill received twice as many as Kyle, so Bill got 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
3. Colby received 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so Colby got 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
4. Griffin started with 24 fries and gave away 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 fries.
5. Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so Griffin received 27 - 24 = 3 fries from Ginger.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 3 fries."	3
245	There are 4 fish in one aquarium, and 32 in the other. The difference in the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice as large as the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Iqiniso likuthi: Ukuba kunefishi 4 kumodzi aquarium, kunefishi 32 kumunye aquarium. Ukudlula kwefishi kumabili aquarium akukhulu kakhulu kunezifishi zemabili aquarium. Uma kumabili aquarium anefishi eyodwa, unefishi mangaki kumodzi aquarium?

(Translation: The truth is: There are 4 fish in one aquarium, and 32 fish in the other aquarium. The difference in the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice as large as the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?)

Ukucophelela: Kuthola ukuthi ukudlula kwefishi kumabili aquarium kungu-28 (32 - 4 = 28). Uma ukudlula kwefishi kungu-28, futhi kungu-2 times ukufishi kumabili aquarium, ukufishi kumabili aquarium kungu-14. Uma ukufishi kumabili aquarium kungu-14, ukufishi kumodzi aquarium kungu-14.

(Translation: The answer is: We find that the difference in the number of fish in the two aquariums is 28 (32 - 4 = 28). If the difference in the number of fish is 28, and it is 2 times the number of fish in the two aquariums, the number of fish in the two aquariums is 14. If the number of fish in the two aquariums is 14, the number of fish in each aquarium is 14.)

246	Jean's make-up artist charges her $250 per hour. If she needs expensive make-up for a film she's in, she needs to work 6 hours a day, 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is made, the make-up artist gives Jean a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. That's a total of:
6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

At $250 per hour, the total cost is:
120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

With a 10% discount, Jean pays:
$30,000 × 0.9 = $27,000

So, Jean pays $27,000.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	27000
247	Isabel spent $12 for the cake, $43 for the birthday present, $15 for the flowers, $4 for the invitation, and $22 for a nice bag for the guests. She divided the cost with her two parents into three parts. How much did each person pay?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabel divided the cost into 3 parts with her 2 parents, so there are 3 people sharing the cost. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3: $96 ÷ 3 = $32

So each person pays $32.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	32
248	Chef bought 4 bags of chicken. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. One pound of chicken costs $1.50. How much did Chef spend?	300	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Chef bought 4 bags of chicken, each weighing 50 pounds. That's a total of 4 x 50 = 200 pounds.

Since one pound costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 x $1.50 = $300.

Odi nma! (That's ""It's good"" in Igbo.) Chef spent $300."	300
249	On Monday, Sue ate four times her sister's cookie, on Tuesday she ate twice her sister's cookie, on Monday she ate five cookies, and the next day she ate 13 cookies. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times her sister's cookie, and she ate 5 cookies. So, her sister ate 5 ÷ 4 = 1.25 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 13 cookies, and she ate twice her sister's cookie. So, her sister ate 13 ÷ 2 = 6.5 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate = 5 + 13 = 18
Total cookies her sister ate = 1.25 + 6.5 = 7.75

Calories Sue ate = 18 x 200 = 3600
Calories her sister ate = 7.75 x 200 = 1550

Sue ate 3600 - 1550 = 2050 calories more than her sister.
