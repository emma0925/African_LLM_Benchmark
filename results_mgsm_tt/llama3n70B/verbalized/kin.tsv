0	Jane's kitchen produces 16 eggs a day, sleeps three every morning and bakes a hot bun with four, selling the rest at the farmer's market every day for 2 cents each egg. And how many dollars does the farmer's market make in a day?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jane's kitchen produces 16 eggs a day.
She sleeps 3 every morning, so she's left with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
She bakes a hot bun with 4 eggs, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at 2 cents each, so she makes 9 x 2 = 18 cents.
To convert cents to dollars, divide by 100: 18 ÷ 100 = $0.18.

So, the farmer's market makes $0.18 in a day.

2	Determined to find a home, Josh bought a house for $800,000 and renovated it for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ok, let's calculate the profit:

Original price = $800,000
Renovation cost = $50,000
Total investment = $800,000 + $50,000 = $850,000

The renovation increased the value by 150%, so the new value is:
$850,000 x 2.5 (150% increase) = $2,125,000

Profit = New value - Total investment = $2,125,000 - $850,000 = $1,275,000

3	Jacob is determined to run 3 times a week, he runs 60 kilometers each time. How many meters does he run a week?	540	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Jacob's weekly run:

3 times a week × 60 kilometers = 180 kilometers

Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, we multiply:

180 kilometers × 1000 meters/kilometer = 180,000 meters

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Jacob runs 180,000 meters a week."	180000
4	Every day Wendi gives her chickens three cups of mixed chicken food, including fruits, vegetables and spices, to make them healthier. She feeds the chickens in three batches. In the morning she gives her chickens 15 cups of food, in the afternoon she gives them 25 cups. And how many cups of food should she give her chickens at the last meal of the day, when the number of her chickens is 20.	20	"""Sawubona! Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Wendi ufuna ukudla izinkukhu zakhe ngomhlane. Ukudla kwesokuhlwa kwaba 15, ukudla kwesibusuku kwaba 25. Ukudla okufanele kwaba (3 x 20) - (15 + 25) = 60 - 40 = 20 cups."""	20
5	Kylar went to the store to buy a whole new bottle. One bottle sold for $5, the next bottle sold for 60% off. Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles. How much does she have to pay for the bottle?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One bottle costs $5. The next bottle is 60% off, which means it costs 40% of $5. That's $5 x 0.4 = $2.

Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles. Let's assume she buys 8 bottles at $5 each and 8 bottles at $2 each.

Total cost = (8 x $5) + (8 x $2) = $40 + $16 = $56.

So, Kylar has to pay $56 for the bottles.

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many rabbits do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, the question asks about rabbits, but there's no information about rabbits. The information is only about sheep. So, we can't determine the total number of rabbits.

7	Carla downloaded 200 GB of files. Normally she might not download 2 GB per minute, but when 40% of the download is done, the computer window pushes it into the boot loader to load new hardware, which takes 20 minutes to load. So Carla has to start the machine from the boot loader, How long does it take to download a file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Carla akhetha amafayili angu-200 GB. Ngokwesikhashana, akadingi ukuthakaza amafayili angu-2 GB ngeminithi, kodwa uma amafayili angu-40% asethunjwa, igatsha le-computer liyabaleka ku-boot loader ukuthi ilode inhlalo entsha, okuqhubeka iminithi engu-20 ukuloda.

Now, let's calculate the time:

Carla needs to download 200 GB. She downloads 2 GB per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to download 200 GB, we divide 200 by 2:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, when 40% of the download is complete, the computer restarts and takes 20 minutes to load new hardware. 40% of 200 GB is:

200 GB × 0.4 = 80 GB

Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so to download 80 GB, it takes:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

After the computer restarts, Carla still needs to download the remaining 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120). This will take:

120 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 60 minutes

Adding the 20 minutes it takes to load new hardware, the total time it takes to download the file is:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Kutheniwa, ukuthakaza amafayili akuya ngeminyaka engu-120! (So, it takes 120 minutes to download the file!)"	120
8	John drove for 3 hours at 60mph, then returned home because he realized he had forgotten something important at home. He tried to get home in 4 hours but spent 2 hours in the ambulance. He spent an hour and a half driving at 30mph before he was able to drive at 80mph for the remaining 4 hours. How far did he go home after 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

John drove for 3 hours at 60mph, so he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

He returned home, but spent 2 hours in the ambulance, so we don't count that distance.

Then, he drove for 1.5 hours at 30mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 1.5 = 45 miles

After that, he drove for 4 hours at 80mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x 4 = 320 miles

So, after 4 hours, he had covered a total distance of:
45 + 320 = 365 miles

Now, let's calculate:

Regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime hours: 5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2) = $60
Total pay: $400 + $60 = $460

U-Eliza uzokuthola izimali eziyi-$460 ngosuku lwesi! (Eliza will earn $460 this week!)"	460
10	The new app had 60 downloads in the first month, a threefold increase in the number of downloads in the second month, but a 30% decrease in the third month. How many files did the app download in three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: 60 downloads
 Month 2: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads (threefold increase)
 Month 3: 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads (30% decrease)

Total downloads in three months = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of breads, bought 3 packs of cumin bread at $68 per dozen, 2 small packs at $80 per pack. 6 boxes of ten and 2 small biscuits at $55 per box. How much did it cost in total?	694	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 3 packs of cumin bread at $68 per dozen = 3 x $68 = $204
* 2 small packs at $80 per pack = 2 x $80 = $160
* 6 boxes of ten at $55 per box = 6 x $55 = $330
* 2 small biscuits (no price given, assuming it's included in the $55 per box) = $0

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Kubonga! (Well done!) The total cost is $694.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Igazi likaToula lilingana ngama-$694."" (Toula's cost is $694.)"	694
12	If Carlos plants a lemon tree for you, it will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year it will produce 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and cover it. How many years will it take before he starts to see the fruit of this lemon tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukuba Carlos abone ukuthenga ukudla kwalemoni, kuya ngama-90 dolara ukuthenga uti. Njalo nje ngonyaka, uti uzoba nesithelo sesi-7 esingaba ngama-1.5 dolara ngese. Kuya ngama-3 dolara ngonyaka ukuthenga amanzi nezincwadi. Iminyaka emi Carlos ithola ukubona ukuthenga kwalemoni?""

Now, let's calculate:

Initial investment: $90
Annual revenue: 7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost: $3/year
Net annual profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5/year

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial investment of $90. Let's divide the initial investment by the net annual profit:

$90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start seeing the fruit of this lemon tree.

13	Melanie is a housewife. She sold one-third of her house-cleaning machine to the grass house, two to the red house, and the rest to the orange house. If Melanie has 5 house-cleaning machines left, how many did she start?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Melanie inemashini angama-5 akhe akaphela. (Melanie has 5 machines left.)

Ukuthola ukuthi inemashini eyodwa eqhamuka egrass house, amabili eqhamuka ered house, nabasebenzisa esitholileyo eqhamuka eorange house. (To find out how many machines she started with, one went to the grass house, two to the red house, and the rest to the orange house.)

Icala le-1/3 liya eqhamuka egrass house, amabili eqhamuka ered house, nabasebenzisa esitholileyo eqhamuka eorange house. (One-third went to the grass house, two to the red house, and the rest to the orange house.)

Ukuthola ukuthi inemashini eyodwa eqhamuka egrass house, amabili eqhamuka ered house, nabasebenzisa esitholileyo eqhamuka eorange house, Melanie wayenemashini angama-15. (To find out how many machines she started with, one went to the grass house, two to the red house, and the rest to the orange house, Melanie had 15 machines.)

14	In a dance school with 20 students, 20% are enrolled in modern dance, 25% are enrolled in jazz, and the rest are enrolled in hip-hop. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in hip-hop?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop:

20% are enrolled in modern dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students
25% are enrolled in jazz, which is 0.25 x 20 = 5 students
Total students enrolled in modern and jazz are 4 + 5 = 9 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop is 20 - 9 = 11 students

To find the percentage, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(11 ÷ 20) x 100 = 55%

So, 55% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop.

15	The retailer wants to choose what to buy between 2 options. Jewelry worth $5000 or electronics worth $8000. His advisor mathematically predicts that the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% while the electronics market will grow by 1.2% in the same month. If the retailer wants to increase its monthly profit by using options, how much profit will he have?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5000
Growth rate: 2.5%
Profit = $5000 x 2.5% = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8000
Growth rate: 1.2%
Profit = $8000 x 1.2% = $96

The retailer should choose Option 1: Jewelry worth $5000, which will give a profit of $125.

16	Two trains departed from San Rafael at the same time, heading west, each traveling 80 kilometers. The next day they headed north, traveling 150 kilometers. How many kilometers did each train travel in two days?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inkomba yakho. (Let me help you with that question.)

Ukuthola inani lokuqhakaza kwesitimela sesikhathi sesibili, sizokucophelela ukubonga amakhilomitha asuka ngemuva kwesitimela esiwudlile. (To find the total distance traveled by each train in two days, we need to add the kilometers traveled by each train.)

Isitimela sesi-1: 80 km (west) + 150 km (north) = 230 km
Isitimela sesi-2: 80 km (west) + 150 km (north) = 230 km

Kuthola ukuthi isitimela sesi-1 nesesi-2 sizidlile izikhilomitha eziyi-230 ngemuva kwesikhathi sesibili. (So, each train traveled a total distance of 230 kilometers in two days.)

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour as a teacher and $30 an hour as the head coach of the fans. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week and 15 hours a week as the top prize, how much does she get per year?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, Jill works 35 hours/week and earns $20/hour, so her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
35 hours/week × $20/hour = $700/week

As the head coach, she works 15 hours/week and earns $30/hour, so her weekly earnings as a coach are:
15 hours/week × $30/hour = $450/week

Her total weekly earnings are: $700/week + $450/week = $1,150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings are:
$1,150/week × 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, this one has one-third water and I want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which has three-fifths water. But when I poured it again I took 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Orange juice: 10 liters with 1/3 water, so water content is 10 x 1/3 = 3.33 liters.

Pineapple juice: 15 liters with 3/5 water, so water content is 15 x 3/5 = 9 liters.

Total water content before mixing: 3.33 + 9 = 12.33 liters.

Now, you took 1 liter of orange juice, which means you removed 1/3 liter of water (since 1/3 of orange juice is water). So, subtract 1/3 from the total water content: 12.33 - 1/3 = 12 liters.

In 24 liters of the mixed juice, there are 12 liters of water.

21	If Raymond and Samantha had children, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Samantha is now 31, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract 23 from his current age: 37 - 23 = 14 years.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

23	Buje shortened by 2 centimeters every nine hours. How many short centimeters will Buje be after baking from 1:00pm to 5:00pm?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

From 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, there are 4 hours. Since Buje shortens by 2 centimeters every 9 hours, we need to find out how many 9-hour periods are in 4 hours.

4 hours ÷ 9 hours = 0.44 (approximately)

Since Buje shortens by 2 centimeters every 9 hours, we multiply the number of 9-hour periods by 2:

0.44 × 2 = 0.88 centimeters

So, Buje will be approximately 0.88 centimeters shorter after baking from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.

24	Kyle bought the best-selling book last year for $19.50. Here I added a 25% discount to the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem. If the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount is 25%, that means the original price was 100%/75% = 4/3 of the discounted price.

Original price = $19.50 x 4/3 = $26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

25	Marie ordered a chicken dinner for $12, 5 milk cartons for $3 each, 4 pizza boxes for $1.50 each, and some pizza boxes. Marie paid a total of $50. How many pizza boxes did Marie send if each box sold for $8.50?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Marie paid a total of $50.

The chicken dinner cost $12.
The 5 milk cartons cost 5 x $3 = $15.
The 4 pizza boxes cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Adding these up, we get: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

So, Marie spent $50 - $33 = $17 on the remaining pizza boxes.

Since each box costs $8.50, we can divide $17 by $8.50 to find the number of boxes: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Marie bought 2 more pizza boxes.

Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

3 shorts x $16.50 = $49.50
3 socks x $22.50 = $67.50
3 shoes x $42.00 = $126.00

Adding all together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

Mishka spent a total of $243.00 on all this clothing.

Let's break it down:

Henry stopped twice while riding his bicycle for 60 kilometers.

He stopped the first time after 20 kilometers.

He stopped again 15 kilometers before completing his journey, which means he stopped at 60 - 15 = 45 kilometers.

So, he walked between 20 kilometers and 45 kilometers.

The distance between his first stop and last stop is 45 - 20 = 25 kilometers.

29	Gloria buys a pair of shoes when she finds a pair that matches her expected shoe price, she has to choose between a pair of regular shoes and a pair of shoes that have a five-dollar price tag that is $5 less than the cost of the regular shoes. If the price tag of the shoes is $33 and the other is twice the price tag. What about the boat's foot?	104	"Sawa sawa! (That's ""hello"" in Swahili!)

Let's break down the problem:

* The price tag of the shoes is $33.
* The regular shoes cost $5 more than the price tag, so they cost $33 + $5 = $38.
* The other shoes cost twice the price tag, so they cost 2 × $33 = $66.

Now, about the boat's foot... I think there might be some confusion! There's no mention of a boat or its foot in the problem. Could you please clarify or provide more context?"	66
30	If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, they will be Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukudla kwabo kuyafana ne-162, baya ngumzabalazo ka-Allen eminyakeni eyi-10 emva kweminyaka."" (Their ages add up to 162, they will be Allen's age 10 years from now.)

Now, let's solve the problem! If we let Allen's current age be A and Darrell's current age be D, we can set up the equation:

A + D = 162

We know that 10 years from now, Allen's age will be A + 10, and Darrell's age will be D + 10. Since they will be the same age, we can set up another equation:

A + 10 = D + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

A = D

Now we can substitute this into the first equation:

A + A = 162

Combine like terms:

2A = 162

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 81

So Allen is currently 81 years old, and Darrell is also 81 years old."	81
31	Gunter is trying to count the beans in the jar, so he asks his friends to tell him how many beans they think are in the jar. One says 80, another says 20 more than the first half. The third says 25% more than the first half. What is their estimate?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80 beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, so 40 + 20 = 60 beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than half of the first friend's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, and 25% of 40 is 10, so 40 + 10 = 50 beans.

So, their estimates are 80, 60, and 50 beans."	50
32	John calls it Big 10. It takes him 5 hours a day to walk around and take care of his business, and how many hours a week does he call it Big?	35	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Now, let's calculate: If John spends 5 hours a day, that's 5 hours/day × 7 days/week = 35 hours/week. So, John calls it Big 10 for 35 hours a week!"	35
33	Gretchen has 110 gold coins, there are 30 more gold coins than federal coins, how many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem together. If there are 30 more gold coins than federal coins, that means if we subtract 30 from the total gold coins, we'll get the number of federal coins. 

So, if Gretchen has 110 gold coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than federal coins, we can set up the equation:

Gold coins = Federal coins + 30

We know Gretchen has 110 gold coins, so:

110 = Federal coins + 30

To find the number of federal coins, we subtract 30 from both sides:

Federal coins = 110 - 30
Federal coins = 80

So, Gretchen has 80 federal coins. And we already know she has 110 gold coins!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	110

Raymond has 40 rings, so half of that is 20. Aaron has 5 more rings than that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 rings. Siobhan has 2 more rings than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 + 2 = 27 rings.

Sawubona! (hello!) Siobhan has 27 rings."	27
35	Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes, in the first 20 minutes he scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes he scored 25% more points. And how many points did he score in total?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.
In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points, which means he scored:
4 points x 1.25 (25% increase) = 5 points

Total points scored = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They now sell 4 yogurts for $5.00 How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Terry's yogurt expenses.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of 1 yogurt is:
$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, let's find out how much Terry spends on 60 yogurts:
60 yogurts × $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt in 30 days.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	30
37	John plans to sell all his toys and spend the money on video toys. He has 13 sets of Legos and sells them for $15 each. He ended up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has 5 left. How many sets of Legos are left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 sets of Legos for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He has $195 - $160 = $35 left, but he didn't buy any more Legos. He already sold all 13 sets, so there are:
Zero sets of Legos left!

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Akukho kuthola ukuthenga kwezinto zika-Lego!"" (There are no Lego sets left to buy!)"	13
38	John runs 60 kilometers a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 and a half hours more the first day than the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

UJohn uyaphenduka ngamakhilomitha angu-60 emvulo wesizinda. Uyaphenduka izinsuku ezintathu zemvulo. Uyaphenduka izikhathi eziyizigidi ezintathu kanye nezigi ezililandelayo kusukela esokweni esiyi-1 kulabo ababili.

(John runs 60 kilometers a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 and a half hours more the first day than the other two days he runs.)

Let's calculate the total hours he runs:

Izikhathi eziyizigidi ezintathu (3 hours) + izigi ezililandelayo (3.5 hours) = izikhathi eziyizigidi ezintathu nezigidigidi ezili-6.5 (6.5 hours)

Total hours = 6.5 hours (first day) + 3 hours (second day) + 3 hours (third day) = 12.5 hours

Now, let's find his speed:

Umkhondo = amakhilomitha / izikhathi (Speed = distance / time)

Umkhondo = 60 km / 12.5 hours ≈ 4.8 km/h

So, John runs at a speed of approximately 4.8 kilometers per hour.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	4
39	Dana can run at four times the speed of walking, but she can jump at half the speed of running. If she can jump 3 kilometers per hour, how many kilometers can she walk in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?	18	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

If Dana can jump at half the speed of running, and she can jump 3 km/h, then her running speed is 2 × 3 = 6 km/h.

Since she can run at four times the speed of walking, her walking speed is 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 km/h.

Now, let's calculate the distance she walks in six hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 2/3 × 6 = 4 hours.

The distance she walks is her walking speed multiplied by the time she walks: 1.5 km/h × 4 h = 6 km.

So, Dana can walk 6 kilometers in six hours.

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi: (Let me calculate...)

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.

Kusho ukuthi Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. (So Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.)

41	A giant dragon, the perg, sat on top of a farbo hill, breathing fire at anything within 1,000 meters. Polly could throw a golden javelin, the only known weapon that could hit a dragon, a distance of 400 meters, precisely with the fire of a serpent. But while polly held a sapphire stone, she could throw a spear three times as fast as without holding a gemstone. If she held a gemstone, how far from the fire of a serpent could polly stand on and still be able to hit a serpent with a javelin spear?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Polly ungathatha isiphezi esithathu kakhulu ngaphandle kokuthatha ithani, futhi ungathatha isiphezi esingama-400 mita. Uma ethatha ithani, ungathatha isiphezi esingama-1200 mita.""

Translated to English: ""Polly can throw a spear three times as far without holding a gemstone, and she can throw a spear 400 meters. If she holds a gemstone, she can throw a spear 1200 meters.""

So, Polly can stand 1200 - 400 = 800 meters away from the fire of a serpent and still be able to hit it with a javelin spear while holding the sapphire stone."	800
42	Grandma Jones cooked 5 apples for the laundry man's lunch. She cut the pie into 8 pieces and sent 5 pies to the guests' table so they could eat. By the end of the evening after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces were taken by the guests?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Grandma Jones akha 5 amaphala (5 apples) for the laundry man's lunch. Akha iphayi (cut the pie) into 8 izindlela (pieces) and usutha 5 iphayi (sent 5 pies) to the guests' table.

If there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, that's a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.

By the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract 14 from 40:

40 - 14 = 26

So, the guests took 26 izindlela (pieces) of pie!

43	According to nutritional data, a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. You've already eaten 1800 calories, and your daily goal is 2000 calories. That means you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, 1 serving is 300g / 5 = 60g. So, you can eat 0.8 servings x 60g/serving = 48g.

44	Charlie wants to sell candlesticks. For every pound of candlesticks he can make 10 closed candlesticks. A pound of candlesticks and whiskey costs $10.00 per pound. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what's the profit if he makes a kid who sells 20 candlesticks?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 pound of candlesticks and whiskey = $10.00
Number of candlesticks made from 1 pound = 10
Cost per candlestick = $10.00 ÷ 10 = $1.00
Selling price per candlestick = $2.00
Profit per candlestick = $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00

If the kid sells 20 candlesticks, the total profit = 20 x $1.00 = $20.00

47	John bought twice as many old ties as blue ties. Old ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties and it cost $40 per tie. How many new ties did he spend?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each tie costs $40. So, he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue ties

Since he bought twice as many old ties as blue ties, he bought:

2 × 5 = 10 old ties

Old ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties, so each old tie costs:

$40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

He spent a total of:

10 old ties × $60 = $600

on old ties. Adding this to the $200 he spent on blue ties, John spent a total of:

$600 + $200 = $800

on new ties.

50	Lloyd keeps chickens, her hens lay 252 eggs a day and sell them for $2 a dozen. How much does Lloyd make in eggs a week?	294	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Hens lay 252 eggs a day. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

252 eggs ÷ 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day

Selling 21 dozen eggs at $2 per dozen:

21 dozen × $2 = $42 per day

In a week, there are 7 days, so:

$42 per day × 7 days = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.

Let's break it down:

Tom's boat goes 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 pm, which is 3 hours. Distance = Speed x Time, so distance = 10 x 3 = 30 miles.

On the way back, he goes 6 miles per hour. To find the time, we use Time = Distance / Speed. Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Uriah's book bag is too heavy, and he wants to lose 15 pounds. He removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. So, he loses 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

He still needs to lose 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. His toys weigh 1/2 pound each, so he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

53	A mechanic charges different rates for repairing truck and car tires. for each truck tire that is broken, the mechanic charges $60 and for each car tire that is broken the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. on Friday the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires are repaired. How much money does the mechanic make on a typical workday?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the mechanic's earnings for Thursday and Friday.

Thursday:
6 truck tires x $60 = $360
4 car tires x $40 = $160
Total earnings on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Friday:
12 car tires x $40 = $480
No truck tires repaired, so $0
Total earnings on Friday = $480

To find the average earnings per day, we add the earnings for both days and divide by 2:
($520 + $480) / 2 = $1000 / 2 = $500

So, the mechanic makes $500 on a typical workday.

The weight of the driver attached to the empty truck is 3755 kg. How many boxes can be transported in the truck without exceeding the weight of the loaded box?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry: 5000 kg - 3755 kg (driver's weight) = 1245 kg

Since each box weighs 15 kg, we can divide the remaining weight by the box weight: 1245 kg ÷ 15 kg = 83 boxes

So, the truck can transport 83 boxes without exceeding the weight limit.

Let's break it down:

For the first 20 years, Mercy earns $50,000 per year. That's a total of:

20 years x $50,000 = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she gets a 5% annual savings bonus. That's an additional:

$50,000 x 0.05 = $2,500 per year

So, for the next 10 years, she earns:

$50,000 (annual savings) + $2,500 (bonus) = $52,500 per year

For the next 10 years, she earns a total of:

She has traveled 100 kilometers since she last filled her tank, and would like to add 4 liters of gas to refill it. Her car's manual says her tank holds 12 liters of gas. How many kilometers does Sophia drive with one gas tank?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

To find out how many kilometers Sophia can drive with one gas tank, we need to convert the distance she's traveled from kilometers to liters of gas consumed. Let's do that!

Since Sophia has traveled 100 kilometers, and her car's manual says the tank holds 12 liters of gas, we can assume that 100 kilometers is equivalent to 12 liters of gas consumed.

Now, let's calculate how many kilometers Sophia can drive with 1 liter of gas:

100 km ÷ 12 liters = 8.33 km/liter (approximately)

Since Sophia wants to add 4 liters of gas to refill her tank, she'll be able to drive an additional:

4 liters × 8.33 km/liter ≈ 33.32 kilometers

Adding this to the distance she's already traveled, Sophia can drive a total of:

65	Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then goes to bed and reads a book half the time. He does this 3 times a week. And how many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and half that time reading, which is 1 hour reading. So, in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV and reading per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week, he spends 3 hours/day × 3 days = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	36
66	There are four schools competing in basketball. Each school sends a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team and each team has 5 players. Each school sends a coach to each team. In total, how many people did all the schools send?	48	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Each school sends 2 teams, and each team has 5 players, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 players per school. Each school also sends 2 coaches, one for each team. So, that's 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.

There are 4 schools, so in total, they sent 4 x 12 = 48 people.

67	A treasure hunter found a treasure chest filled with precious stones. There were 175 diamonds, 35 rubies, and twice as many emeralds as rubies. How many precious stones were in the chest?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the precious stones:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 35
* Emeralds: 2 x 35 = 70

Total precious stones: 175 + 35 + 70 = 280

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There were 280 precious stones in the chest."	280
68	There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys.

Total students = girls + boys = 60 + 120 = 180 students.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, then the number of teachers = total students ÷ 5 = 180 ÷ 5 = 36 teachers.

Ukubonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate:

Daily classes: 5 classes/day × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1125/day
Weekday classes: 8 classes/day × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1800/day × 5 days = $9000
Saturday classes: 8 classes/day × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1800

74	Artie has flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He normally sells marigolds for $2.74 per can, petunias for $1.87 per can, and begonias for $2.12 per can. Today Artie has no returns, so he's committed to cutting his total price by almost a dollar. If Artie sold 12 cans of marigolds, 9 cans of petunias, and 17 cans of begonias, how much will he collect?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Artie will collect:

Marigolds: 12 cans x $2.74 = $32.88
Petunias: 9 cans x $1.87 = $16.83
Begonias: 17 cans x $2.12 = $36.04

Total amount: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $85.75

Since Artie wants to cut the total price by almost a dollar, let's subtract $0.90 (almost a dollar) from the total amount:

$85.75 - $0.90 = $84.85

So, Artie will collect approximately $84.85.

76	Cecilia bought a new puppy, and according to her veterinarian, she has to give the puppy 1 cup of food every day for the first 180 days. Then give the puppy 2 cups of food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of food has 110 cups, how many bags of food will cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup of food per day, so she'll need:
180 days x 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After that, she'll need 2 cups of food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so for the remaining days, she'll need:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days
185 days x 2 cups/day = 370 cups

In total, Cecilia will need:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of food has 110 cups, she'll need:
550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of food in the first year.

77	If Raymond did half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah did 4 times as much laundry as David did, what is the difference in the number of laundries Raymond and David did if Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry?	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah did 400 pounds of laundry.
David did 1/4 of what Sarah did, so David did 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond did half of what Sarah did, so Raymond did 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukudla kwethu kukubonga!"" (The difference is 100 pounds!)

78	Vicent can buy a 3-pack of flowers for $2.50 or a 2-pack of flowers for $1. How much money will he save by buying 18 flowers at the right price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

3-pack of flowers costs $2.50, so 1 flower costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
2-pack of flowers costs $1, so 1 flower costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

To buy 18 flowers, Vincent can buy:
- 6 packs of 3 flowers each, costing 6 × $2.50 = $15
- 9 packs of 2 flowers each, costing 9 × $1 = $9

By buying 9 packs of 2 flowers each, Vincent will save $15 - $9 = $6.

86	Grea has an alarm to speak three times a day that she remembers. When the alarm goes off, she continues to speak until Greg turns it off. The first time she turned it off today it sounded four times. The second time she turned it off, she cried three times more than the first time. The third time she cried half as much as the second time, how many times did the alarm go off in total?	22	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Let's do it!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

1. The first time, the alarm sounded 4 times.
2. The second time, it sounded 3 more times than the first time, so 4 + 3 = 7 times.
3. The third time, it sounded half as much as the second time, so 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 times. Since you can't have a fraction of a sound, let's round down to 3 times.

Now, let's add up the total: 4 + 7 + 3 = 14 times.

Let's solve this problem in isiZulu, my friend!

Kuthiwa uMarilyn wayengaphansi kwesithupha senani lakhe kuHarald. Kuthiwa babengaphansi kwama-88,000 ekupheleni.

(Translation: It is said that Marilyn's sales were six times more than Harald's. It is said that they sold 88,000 copies in total.)

Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of copies Harald sold. Then, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies!

Cindy has 4 animals.
Marcia has 2 more animals than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 animals.

Let's break it down:

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy = Jackson + 5
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy = Corey - 2
* James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so James = Corey - 1, and James = 10, so Corey = 11
* Now, Amy = Corey - 2, so Amy = 11 - 2 = 9

93	Lee could run the 400 meters in two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400 meters. But Gerald changed his diet, and it increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how fast could Gerald run the 400 meters with a good diet in how many seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds. Gerald was 2 seconds slower, so he ran it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

With a good diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find 10% of 40, multiply 40 by 0.1, which gives you 4. So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Gerald could run the 400 meters with a good diet in 36 seconds.

Let's break it down:

* Number of dogs = 60
* Number of cats = 2 x number of dogs = 2 x 60 = 120
* Number of feral animals = 12

95	of the 200 students there are 5,2/5th graders and 2/3 boys and girls scouts. How many girls are not scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

There are 200 students in total.

* 5/2 of the students are 5th graders, which means 5/2 × 200 = 500/2 = 250 students are 5th graders.
* 2/3 of the students are boys and girls scouts, which means 2/3 × 200 = 400/3 = 133.33 (round down to 133) students are scouts.

Since there are 250 students who are 5th graders, and 133 are scouts, the number of 5th graders who are scouts is 133.

The number of girls who are scouts is half of 133, which is 133/2 = 66.5 (round down to 66).

The total number of girls is half of 250, which is 250/2 = 125.

So, the number of girls who are not scouts is 125 - 66 = 59.

Enjoying humanity, she is determined to give 1 plant from each section to her friends and neighbors tomorrow. How many seedlings will Mary have left?	58	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mary bekune 18 amaseedling amasha ukuya ku-nursery yakhe. (Mary received 18 new seedlings from her favorite nursery.)

Uyabona ukuthi une 2 amaseedling angama-40 amaplanthi akwihlalutho. (She has 2 seedlings for every 40 plants in the household.)

Ukuya ngoku, uyakhetha ukubonga abantu bakhe ngokunika amaplanthi amahlanu ku-1 ku-section yakhe. (Tomorrow, she is determined to give 1 plant from each section to her friends and neighbors.)

Siyabonga! (Let's calculate!)

Mary had 18 seedlings initially.
She wants to give 1 plant from each section, and she has 2 seedlings for every 40 plants. That means she has 2/40 = 0.05 sections.
So, she'll give away 0.05 x 18 = 0.9 seedlings (let's round up to 1 seedling, since you can't give a fraction of a seedling).

Mary will have 18 - 1 = 17 seedlings left.

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi Mary uzoba nesaseedling ezi-17 ngoku! (I hope that helps, and Mary will have 17 seedlings left tomorrow!)"	17
100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend said an additional 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend refused an additional 1/4 to become Jerome's first friend. The third friend refused an additional 10 times as much as the fourth friend. if the fourth friend refused an additional 60 times, how many times did Jerome cry altogether?	175	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""I understand"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down:

* The first friend said an additional 20 times.
* The second friend refused an additional 1/4 to become Jerome's first friend, so the second friend said 20 - (1/4 × 20) = 20 - 5 = 15 times.
* The third friend refused an additional 10 times as much as the fourth friend, who refused 60 times. So, the third friend refused 60 × 10 = 600 times.
* Now, add up the number of times Jerome cried: 20 + 15 + 600 + 60 = 695 times.

O di kwa! (That's ""It is good"" in Igbo.) Jerome cried 695 times altogether."	695
101	Solo has to read 4 pages of his science book, 20 pages of his social book, 8 pages of his history book, and 8 pages of his geography book. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to finish his reading, how many pages should he read in one day?	6	"Nzuri sana! (Very good!) Let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

4 pages (science) + 20 pages (social) + 8 pages (history) + 8 pages (geography) = 40 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has:

40 pages - 15 pages = 25 pages left to read

He has 4 days to finish his reading, so he should read:

25 pages ÷ 4 days = 6.25 pages per day

Solo should read approximately 6-7 pages per day to finish his reading on time.

102	John likes to drink a glass of water with his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then he takes one before going to bed. John does this every day, but on weekends he likes to take a break and drinks soda with his dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink a week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John drinks 4 glasses of water on weekdays (Monday to Friday) = 4 x 5 = 20 glasses

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks 3 glasses of water and 1 soda = 3 x 2 = 6 glasses

Total glasses of water John drinks a week = 20 + 6 = 26 glasses

104	Poppy solves 1,000 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, and then her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces. How many pieces of the jigsaw are left to put together?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy starts with 1,000 pieces.
She puts a quarter (1/4) of the pieces on the board, which is:
1,000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces

So, 1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces are left.

Her mother puts a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces, which is:
750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to put together.

106	John has 3 boxes.Each box is 5 cm by 6 cm by 4 cm.The wall is 1 cm high.What is the internal thickness of all 3 boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the internal thickness of each box:

Volume of each box = Length x Width x Height = 5 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm = 120 cubic cm

Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal volume is:
3 x 120 cubic cm = 360 cubic cm

Now, let's convert the wall height from 1 cm to cubic cm:
1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cubic cm (since it's a cube)

So, the internal thickness of all 3 boxes is:
360 cubic cm - 3 x 1 cubic cm = 357 cubic cm

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi ungakwazi ukubonga! (I hope you understand!)"	357
107	Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour of his favorite episode that aired every night. On Wednesday he watched a few episodes of 30 minutes. On Thursday he finished his homework early and watched an episode of 1 hour and 30 minutes. On Friday he stayed up late for the weekend, so he watched two episodes of one hour each. If he watched 7 TV shows in total, what episode of 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour x 2 = 2 hours
Wednesday: x episodes of 30 minutes (we'll come back to this)
Thursday: 1 hour 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Total hours: 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, let's convert:
5.5 hours x 60 minutes = 330 minutes

We know Frankie watched 7 TV shows in total. Let's calculate the total minutes:
Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Thursday: 1.5 hours x 60 minutes = 90 minutes
Friday: 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Total minutes so far: 120 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes

Now, let's find the minutes for Wednesday:
330 minutes (total) - 330 minutes (Monday, Thursday, Friday) = 0 minutes
But wait, Frankie watched some episodes on Wednesday! Let's find out how many:
Since each episode is 30 minutes, let's divide the remaining minutes by 30:
0 minutes (remaining) = 0 episodes of 30 minutes

However, we know Frankie watched some episodes on Wednesday. This means our initial calculation was incorrect. Let's re-examine the total minutes:
We know Frankie watched 7 TV shows in total. Let's calculate the total minutes:
Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Thursday: 1.5 hours x 60 minutes = 90 minutes
Friday: 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Wednesday: x episodes of 30 minutes
Total minutes: 120 + 90 + 120 + 30x = 330 minutes

Now, let's solve for x:
330 minutes = 120 + 90 + 120 + 30x
330 = 330 + 30x
30x = 0
x = 0

Wait, this can't be right! Frankie did watch some episodes on Wednesday. Let's re-examine the question. Ah-ha!
The question asks, ""What episode of 30 minutes did he watch on Wednesday?"" The answer is not a specific number, but rather ""some episodes."" Frankie watched some episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

108	Henry is making cookies for the company, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finished working, he realized that he had made 15 more cookies than he planned to make. He removed 5 cookies and put them out for permanent display, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Henry has 110 cookies now, but he removed 5 cookies, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies initially.

He made 15 more cookies than he planned to make, so he planned to make 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so if he made x cookies last year, then 2x = 100.

Solving for x, we get x = 100/2 = 50.

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Henry wayenza amakuki angu-50 emnyakeni odlule."" (Henry made 50 cookies last year.)"	50
109	The gas station is selling gas at $3.00 a gallon. The software company offers $20 cash per gallon if you pay at the station. If a person sells 10 gallons of gas, how much of their gas will be after the refund?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount the person will get:

10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00 (cost of gas)
10 gallons x $20.00 per gallon (refund) = $200.00 (refund amount)
Total amount = $200.00 (refund) - $30.00 (cost) = $170.00

So, after the refund, the person will have $170.00.

If the jamal phone can store 1800 photos, how many pictures can be found in jamal's photos?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let x be the number of birds in Jamal's photos.

Brittany's phone can store 50x photos.

Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so it can store 6(50x) = 300x photos.

We know Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, so 300x = 1800.

Divide both sides by 300: x = 1800/300 = 6.

So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photos.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she has 5 pieces at $16 each, so that's 5 x $16 = $80.

Adding both amounts together, Sasha would make a total of $100 + $80 = $180.

119	Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. After four years, her salary increased, and she was earning 40% more than she had earned in the previous four years. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, what would both of their salaries be after four years?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so if Adrien earned $40,000, Lylah earned:

$40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769

After four years, Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so her new salary is:

$30,769 x 1.4 = $43,076

Adrien's salary also increased simultaneously, so his new salary is:

$40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000

So, after four years, Adrien's salary would be $56,000, and Lylah's salary would be $43,076.

Let's break it down step by step:

* Julia used 3 spoons to cool her soup, so she had 12 - 3 = 9 spoons left.

128	Well's mother sells pears, walnuts, and oranges at the local grocery store. A pear costs three times what a pear costs. A walnut costs 5 less than a pear. Dillon was sent to the store to buy 4 pears, 20 walnuts, and 10 walnuts. And how much money will he spend in total if a pear costs $15?	880	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I love getting into a conversation!)

Let's break it down:

* A pear costs $15.
* A walnut costs 3 times a pear, so it's $15 x 3 = $45.
* But wait, a walnut costs 5 less than a pear, so it's $45 - 5 = $40.
* An orange costs the same as a pear, so it's $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 pears = 4 x $15 = $60
* 20 walnuts = 20 x $40 = $800
* 10 oranges = 10 x $15 = $150

Adding it all up, Dillon will spend a total of $60 + $800 + $150 = $1010.

129	The hospital receives 500 patients per day. Each patient is admitted for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and hospitals charge patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital gain from these revivals?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* 500 patients per day, each admitted for 24 minutes = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes
* Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours
* Doctors charge $150 per hour, so total doctor fees = 200 hours x $150 = $30,000
* Hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so total hospital revenue = 200 hours x $200 = $40,000
* Profit for the hospital = Total hospital revenue - Total doctor fees = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

So, the hospital gains $10,000 in profit from these revivals.

That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.
Then, 10 more elves resign, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Kutheni, 30 elves are left! (That's ""So, 30 elves are left!"" in isiZulu.)"	30
131	Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was further reduced by $60. How much did he spend in those two months?	940	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* One-third of 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 unicorns.

137	Rory ordered 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 packets of cookies for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each for distribution. There is an additional 20% donation fee on the check and she would like to add a $5.00 credit. How much will she pay in total?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the calculation:

2 subs = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 packets of cookies = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Add 20% donation fee = $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
Total amount = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

 Subtract $5.00 credit = $24.00 - $5.00 = $19.00

So, Rory will pay $19.00 in total.

141	There are 700 bees in the honeycomb. There are twice as many worker bees as brood bees, and twice as many queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Kunezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini (There are 700 bees in the honeycomb)
* Kunezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini ezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini (There are twice as many worker bees as brood bees)
* Kunezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini ezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini ezinhlanhla zamasoti asekhishini (and twice as many queen bees)

Let's assume the number of brood bees is x. Then, the number of worker bees is 2x, and the number of queen bees is 2x/2 = x.

We know the total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x = 700

Combine like terms:

4x = 700

Divide by 4:

x = 175

So, there are 175 brood bees. Since there are twice as many worker bees, there are:

2x = 2(175) = 350

worker bees!

Ok, let's do the math:

Jordan plays video games 2 hours a day, so in a week (7 days), he would play 2 hours/day × 7 days = 14 hours.

If he worked those 14 hours instead, he would earn 14 hours × $10/hour = $140.

So, Jordan would make $140 in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working.

Snacks = $4
Total food cost = $2 + $3 + $4 = $9

Non-food items:
Lights = $3
Cups = $3
Total non-food cost = $3 + $3 = $6

10% tax on non-food items = $6 x 0.1 = $0.6
Total non-food cost with tax = $6 + $0.6 = $6.6

Total cost = Total food cost + Total non-food cost with tax
= $9 + $6.6
= $15.6

Kulungile! (It's okay!) The total cost is $15.6."	15
144	Kim started her home business and calculated the profit she would make from her customers. She has 3 customers, but she is talking to 5 other customers who she feels confident enough to include in her calculations. Each customer in the household will need 2 bottles of java water and a pack of laundry to clean. The java water bottles will cost $2 each and the laundry packs will cost $5 each. This is all the money she will spend. She calculates that her weekly income will be $92. The profit is the difference between her total income and her spending, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 existing customers and 5 potential customers, so she expects 8 customers in total.

Each customer needs 2 bottles of java water and 1 pack of laundry, so the total cost will be:
2 bottles/java water * $2/bottle = $4/java water
1 pack/laundry * $5/pack = $5/laundry
Total cost per customer = $4 + $5 = $9/customer
Total cost for 8 customers = $9/customer * 8 customers = $72

Kim's weekly income is $92, and her total cost is $72, so her profit will be:
Profit = Total income - Total cost = $92 - $72 = $20

Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple farm. On each hectare there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukuthola inani le-pineapple John angakwazi ukuthola ngonyaka. (Let me calculate the number of pineapples John can harvest in a year.)

John uneshectari lesi-10, futhi kusekusho ukuthi ku-hectare eliyi-1, kunepineapple engu-100. (John has 10 hectares, and on each hectare, there are 100 pineapples.)

Ukuthola inani le-pineapple John angakwazi ukuthola ngonyaka, ngicela ukuthola inani le-pineapple angakwazi ukuthola ngosuku olulodwa. (To calculate the number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, I need to calculate the number of pineapples he can harvest in one season.)

Ngosuku olulodwa, John angakwazi ukuthola i-pineapple engu-10 * 100 = 1000. (In one season, John can harvest 1000 pineapples.)

Ngonyaka, kunasuku olu-4. (In a year, there are 4 seasons.)

147	Debra is monitoring the hive to see how many bees are coming and going during the day.She saw 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours, and then saw 1/2 of the bees that were going to come back in the next 6 hours.She saw twice as many bees as she had seen before leaving the hive and going in the next 6 hours.Then all the bees that had gone before but had not returned returned returned to the hive in the next 6 hours.How many bees did Debra see coming back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.

In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that were going to come back came back. Let's call this number x. So, x/2 bees came back.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees left the hive as had left before. This means 2 × 30 = 60 bees left the hive.

Now, all the bees that had gone before but had not returned came back to the hive in the last 6 hours. This means x - x/2 = x/2 bees came back.

We know that x/2 + 30 = 60 (because the number of bees that came back in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours plus the number of bees that came back in the second 6 hours).

Solving for x, we get x = 60.

So, in the last 6 hours, x/2 = 30 bees came back to the hive.

Let's break it down: 1 adult ticket is $12 and 1 child ticket is $10, so the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany's mother was refunded $8, that means she gave the cashier $22 + $8 = $30.

150	Steve and Tim decided to see who could get home early from school.Steve lives far away from Tim, so he was allowed to ride his bike.Steve lives 3 kilometers from the school and can cycle at 440 meters per minute.Tim lives 2 kilometers from the school.If Tim can skateboard at 264 meters per minute, how long will the winner wait in their home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Steve cycles at 440 meters per minute, and he needs to cover a distance of 3 kilometers, which is equal to 3000 meters. To find out how long it takes Steve to get home, we can divide the distance by his speed:

3000 meters ÷ 440 meters/minute = 6.82 minutes (approximately)

Now, let's look at Tim's situation. He skateboards at 264 meters per minute and needs to cover a distance of 2 kilometers, which is equal to 2000 meters. To find out how long it takes Tim to get home, we can divide the distance by his speed:

2000 meters ÷ 264 meters/minute = 7.58 minutes (approximately)

Since Steve gets home faster, he will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will wait for Tim to finish, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:

7.58 minutes - 6.82 minutes = 0.76 minutes

So, Steve will wait approximately 0.76 minutes, or 45.6 seconds, before Tim finishes the race.

Let's break it down:

* 5 people with 2 bikes each = 5 x 2 = 10 bikes. Each bike costs $25, so that's 10 x $25 = $250.
* 3 people with motorcycle tires (assuming 1 tire per motorcycle) = 3 x $25 = $75.

153	Dave bought a large packet of French fries and ate nineteen of them before a hungry bird stole the packet from his pocket.When the bird landed,it took half of the French fries Dave had eaten.Then three pigeons chased him away from the nest,and the whole pigeon ate three of the fries.Then, marcoun stole two of the remaining three fries.The ants took the last French fries,leaving the last five.How many French fries were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Dave ate 19 French fries, and the bird took half of those, which is 19 ÷ 2 = 9.5, but since we can't have half a fry, let's round down to 9.

The bird had 19 - 9 = 10 French fries left.

The three pigeons ate 3 of those, leaving 10 - 3 = 7.

Marcoun stole 2, leaving 7 - 2 = 5.

The ants took the last 1, leaving 5.

So, the bird had 10 French fries initially, and Dave ate 19 before that. Therefore, the total number of French fries in the packet when Dave bought them was 10 + 19 = 29.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 classes/day × 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 classes/day × 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day × 2 days/week = 8 hours/week

Total hours/week = 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so:

* 60 baguettes x 2 meters = 120 meters = 12000 cm (since 1 meter = 100 cm)

Add them all up: 1200 cm + 720 cm + 12000 cm = 13920 cm

156	The ranger feeds all the monkeys in the park.He calls all the monkeys in the nearby fields every 2 months.If a monkey needs 200 monkeys, a baboon needs 400 monkeys, and a monkey needs 100 monkeys per month, how many monkeys does he need to survive for 2 months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* A monkey needs 200 units/month, so for 2 months, it needs 200 x 2 = 400 units.
* A baboon needs 400 units/month, so for 2 months, it needs 400 x 2 = 800 units.
* A monkey needs 100 units/month, so for 2 months, it needs 100 x 2 = 200 units.

To find the total, we add these up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 units.

Let's break this down:

Blake runs 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he covers a distance of:
15 x 100 = 1500 yards

Kelly runs 34 times on a 40-yard section, so she covers a distance of:
34 x 40 = 1360 yards

Since Blake covers more distance, he is the winner. To find out how much faster he runs than Kelly, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance:
1500 - 1360 = 140 yards

So, Blake runs 140 yards faster than Kelly.

162	If a bag of gems costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much would a bag of gems cost after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me calculate that for you...

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% every 2 months
Time = 36 months = 18 periods (since it increases every 2 months)

New price = $20 x (1 + 0.20)^18 ≈ $145.92

Kusho ukuthola! (You're welcome!) The bag of gems would cost approximately $145.92 after 36 months."	36
163	In the room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll.A doll costs about 3 action figures and one red car costs $4.How much did all the toys cost, if the action figures cost $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 doll = 3 action figures + 1 red car
* 1 action figure = $5
* 1 red car = $4

So, 1 doll = 3 x $5 + $4 = $19

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 5 red cars = 5 x $4 = $20
* 3 action figures = 3 x $5 = $15
* 1 doll = $19

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $19 = $54

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"	54
164	Jackie tries to decide between paying her own taxes or hiring a bookkeeper.If she pays her own taxes, she will be able to work 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in income.The bookkeeper charges $90.How much more would she make if she hired a bookkeeper?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi i-amount engaziwayo yi-$35/hour. Uma uJackie enza 3 amahora, uyothola i-amount engaziwayo yi-$35/hour * 3 = $105. Uma uyakuthola i-bookkeeper, uyothola i-$90. Ngakho, uJackie uyothola ukuthola i-amount engaziwayo yi-$105 - $90 = $15.

Translation:

I want to find the unknown amount, which is $35/hour. If Jackie works 3 hours, she will lose $35/hour * 3 = $105. If she hires a bookkeeper, she will lose $90. So, Jackie will gain $105 - $90 = $15."	15
165	For her 30th birthday, Elvira chooses a new computer with a lot of hardware as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks she will be able to save some money to get the dress. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine for €1090 with a screen, a notebook and a mouse. She also gets a scanner for €157, a CD player for €74 and a printer for €102. How much of her debt will she have left?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Elvira bought:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD player) + €102 (printer) = €1423

166	Sandra's neighbor gave her a basket of 9 eggs each time she raised their daughter.To make Spanish Flan, she needs 3 eggs.If Sandra was given the task of making 15 Spanish Flan for a school fundraiser, how many times does Sandra have to babysit?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Sandra needs 3 eggs to make 1 Spanish Flan.
* She needs to make 15 Spanish Flan, so she'll need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.
* Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits.
* To find out how many times she needs to babysit, divide the total eggs needed (45) by the eggs given each time (9): 45 ÷ 9 = 5.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish Flan!"	15
167	Seth is twice as old as Brooke.In 2 years, their combined age will be 28.How old is Seth?	16	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Seth uyindlela kabili Brooke. (Seth is twice as old as Brooke.)

Kuthiwa ngemva kweminyaka emibili, iminyaka yabo iyohlanganisa ithola 28. (In 2 years, their combined age will be 28.)

Let's use ""s"" for Seth's current age and ""b"" for Brooke's current age.

Seth uyindlela kabili Brooke, so s = 2b.

Ngemva kweminyaka emibili, iminyaka yabo ithola 28, so (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: s + b + 4 = 28.

Substitute s = 2b: 2b + b + 4 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3b + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3b = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: b = 8.

Now that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age: s = 2b = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is currently 16 years old."	16

Let's break it down:

* Hat: $25
* Jacket: 3 x $25 = $75

171	Jake is walking through the Entomological Museum. He sees 80 primates with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 strange mutant animals with 10 legs each. How many legs did Jake see at one time?	1210	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukucophelela ukuthi Jake wayibona ingani yezinyawo ezitholakalayo. (Let me calculate the total number of legs Jake saw.)

80 amaqhuzu anesihlanu sesinyawo (80 primates with 8 legs each) = 80 x 8 = 640 izinyawo

90 amagquba anesithupha sesinyawo (90 insects with 6 legs each) = 90 x 6 = 540 izinyawo

3 izilwane ezimbi ezinezingubo ezilishumi (3 strange mutant animals with 10 legs each) = 3 x 10 = 30 izinyawo

172	There are four birds on Caboose.Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four.If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, and Sally Thirty-two is 8, how old are these birds at the same time?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sally Four = Sally Thirty-two = 8 years old
Granny Red = 2 × Sally Four = 2 × 8 = 16 years old
Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years old

So, the ages of the birds are:
Sally Four = 8
Sally Thirty-two = 8
Granny Red = 16
Sally Two = 19

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Izinyoka zisebenzisa iminyaka engu-8, engu-8, engu-16, nezingu-19."" (The birds are 8, 8, 16, and 19 years old.)"	19

174	Billy is pressing and cutting potatoes in preparation for making the first salad for his large family to gather for barbecue.It's a big party, so he has 60 potatoes to finish.The potatoes are the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to press and cut each one.It takes Billy about a minute and a half to press the potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it.How long will it take Billy to finish making the potatoes?	95	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

 Ukudla okubili (The time for pressing) = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
 Ukudla okucutshwa (The time for cutting) = 5 seconds
 Ukudla okubili + ukudla okucutshwa (Total time per potato) = 90 + 5 = 95 seconds
 Ukuphela kwesikhathi (Total time) = Ukudla okubili + ukudla okucutshwa * 60 (number of potatoes)
 Ukuphela kwesikhathi = 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds
 Ukuphela kwesikhathi = 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes

Kusho ukuthi (So) Billy will take 95 minutes to finish making the potatoes.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemons.For each lemon they make, it costs $3 for the lemon and $2 for the sugar.They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for each lemon.If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on the lemon?	15	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

They sell 20 bottles for each lemon, and each bottle is sold for $0.50, so they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per lemon.

It costs $3 for the lemon and $2 for the sugar, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5 per lemon.

They make $10 and spend $5, so their profit per lemon is $10 - $5 = $5.

If they made $25 in profit, they must have sold 25 / $5 = 5 lemons.

Since each lemon costs $3, they spent 5 x $3 = $15 on lemons.

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)

In isiZulu, the answer is: ""Batholele $15."" (They spent $15.)"	15

177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and gives half of the rest to his favorite charity.He gives his daughter $200 to spend on groceries every week and $700 to his wife to cook food and other household items.If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much will he have left over after all the expenses and donations?	350	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
3. Total spent so far: $1,500 + $2,000 = $3,500
4. Rest of the salary: $6,000 - $3,500 = $2,500
5. Donation to charity: half of $2,500 = $1,250
6. Total spent so far: $3,500 + $1,250 = $4,750
7. Weekly groceries for daughter: $200
8. Monthly groceries for daughter: $200 x 4 = $800
9. Monthly household items for wife: $700
10. Total monthly expenses: $4,750 + $800 + $700 = $6,250

Now, let's calculate how much Zaid will have left over:

$6,000 (monthly salary) - $6,250 (total monthly expenses) = -$250

Unfortunately, Zaid will be in the red by $250. He will need to adjust his expenses or find ways to increase his income.

Bo has 40 fingers.
Rani has 4 fewer fingers than Bo, so Rani has 40 - 4 = 36 fingers.
Monic has 10 fewer fingers than Rani, so Monic has 36 - 10 = 26 fingers.

181	Sandra, a nearby florist, was upset that Fred had not delivered her order.Sandra had ordered red flowers that were four times the size of the white carnation.She also ordered 200 purple and calla flowers, which were five times the number of white flowers.Sandra said that she would change the florist if the flowers were not available by 11 p.m.In order for Sandra to keep working, how many red flowers would Fred have to deliver by 11 p.m.?	160	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkolelo! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Red flowers are 4 times the size of white carnations, but we don't know the number of white carnations. Let's call it x.
* Purple and calla flowers are 5 times the number of white flowers, which is 5x.
* The total number of flowers is 200 (purple and calla) + x (white) = 200 + x.
* Since Sandra ordered red flowers that are 4 times the size of white carnations, the number of red flowers is 4x.

We know Sandra ordered 200 purple and calla flowers, so we can set up the equation:

200 + x = 4x

Subtract x from both sides:

200 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 66.67 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 67 white carnations. Since red flowers are 4 times the size of white carnations, Fred needs to deliver:

4x = 4(67) = 268

red flowers by 11 p.m. for Sandra to keep working.

Let's break it down in isiZulu, my friend.

Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jan. So, two years ago, Mark was 30 - 2 = 28, and Jan was 28 - 5 = 23. That means Mark is currently 28 + 2 = 30 years old.

Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is 30 + 2 = 32 years old.

183	Two cycling teams compete in the 4 × 400 metres relay race; a race in which each cycling team consists of four people, each of whom runs 400 metres, or one lap, in a typical race.One of the two teams consists of specific individuals and each of them runs 400 metres in 55 seconds.The other team's athletes do not have the same ability; their first runner will run the 400 metres in 60 seconds, each of the next runners will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.Based on this data, how many seconds is the fastest team going to win the race?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the times for each team:

Team 1: Each runner takes 55 seconds, so the total time is 4 x 55 = 220 seconds.

Team 2: The first runner takes 60 seconds. The next runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The next runner is 3 seconds faster than that, so they take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The last runner is 3 seconds faster than that, so they take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for Team 2 is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. So, the fastest team will win the race by 2 seconds.

184	Jerry is throwing a six-sided dice.What is the approximate probability that he is more likely to throw 3 dice than he is to throw two consecutive funny numbers?	25	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuba Jerry ebiza i-dice yesixhobo, ingaba iphakathi yakhe yokuba eyenza amanani angu-3 kunezifunny ezimbili ezizodwa ukuba zingafani?""

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Probability of throwing 3: 1/6 (since there's one favorable outcome out of six possible outcomes)

Probability of throwing two consecutive funny numbers (assuming funny numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 6): There are 4 funny numbers, and we need two consecutive ones. The possible pairs are (2, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 6). So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes (6 × 6). The probability is 3/36 = 1/12.

Since 1/6 is greater than 1/12, Jerry is more likely to throw 3 than to throw two consecutive funny numbers."	3

186	Russell works in a pet store, and is distributing grass to the mice.The mice are kept in cages in 3 equal groups and each mouse is given grass 6.There are 10 kitten cages that are placed in single rooms, and each animal is given grass 5.There is also a rabbit pen, where they are given 20 grass.There is no grass anywhere else in the store.If the small insects are given 160 grass, how many mice are there per square?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Imice yi-3 groups, and each mouse gets 6 grass, so total grass for mice = 6 x? (number of mice) = 6m
* Ama-kitten ayi-10 cages, each gets 5 grass, so total grass for kittens = 10 x 5 = 50
* Ama-rabbit aya-1 pen, gets 20 grass, so total grass for rabbits = 20
* Ama-insect ayi-160 grass

Total grass in the store = 6m + 50 + 20 + 160

Since there's no grass anywhere else, the total grass is equal to the grass given to insects: 6m + 50 + 20 + 160 = 160

Solving for m (number of mice), we get: 6m = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90, so m = 90/6 = 15

Since there are 3 groups of mice, each group has 15/3 = 5 mice.

So, there are 5 mice per square!"	5
187	Mandy owed Benedict $100.They agreed to pay 2% interest each month.If Mandy could pay it off after three months, how much would she owe Benedict?	106	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mandy owed Benedict $100 initially.

For the first month, she'll pay 2% interest, which is $100 x 0.02 = $2.
So, the total amount she owes after the first month is $100 + $2 = $102.

For the second month, she'll pay 2% interest on the new total, which is $102 x 0.02 = $2.04.
So, the total amount she owes after the second month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

For the third month, she'll pay 2% interest on the new total, which is $104.04 x 0.02 = $2.0808.
So, the total amount she owes after the third month is $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1216.

Rounding it up to two decimal places, Mandy would owe Benedict approximately $106.12 after three months.

188	A merchant buys bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 per bag.If it costs $2 to transport one bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant earned $400 after selling all the bags for $30 each, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend.

The merchant buys bags of wheat for $20 each and sells them for $30 each. So, the profit per bag is $30 - $20 = $10.

However, it costs $2 to transport each bag, so the net profit per bag is $10 - $2 = $8.

The merchant earned $400 in total, so to find the number of bags, we divide the total profit by the net profit per bag:

$400 ÷ $8 = 50 bags

So, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat!

189	Three friends spent $20.25 on three tickets to the exhibition.They also spent $4.50 on food, which is less than they spent on tickets.They also went on two separate trips, each costing $33.If they agreed to split the total cost equally, how much did each of them pay?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the costs:

* 3 tickets: $20.25
* Food: $4.50
* 2 trips: 2 x $33 = $66

Let's break it down. Each bat needs 3.5 kg of insects per week. There are 7 days in a week, so each bat needs:

3.5 kg ÷ 7 days = 0.5 kg of insects per day

Now, there are 10 bats in the flock. To find out how many kg of insects they need per day, we multiply:

0.5 kg/day × 10 bats = 5 kg of insects per day

After 10 years, he would have planted 10 x 8 = 80 trees.
Total trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

193	Sue lives in an interesting neighborhood.One weekend, the neighbors decided to make fun of Sue.On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos in Sue's garden.On Saturday morning, the neighbors took one-third of the birds, painted them white, and placed them in Sue's garden.Then, on Sunday morning, they added 18 more pink and purple flamingos.On Sunday afternoon, how many more red flamingos were out than there were in the week?	24	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Friday: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday: 1/3 of 18 = 6 birds taken, painted white, and returned. So, 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left, and 6 white flamingos added. Total: 12 pink + 6 white = 18 flamingos.
Sunday morning: 18 more pink and purple flamingos added. Total: 18 (previous) + 18 (new) = 36 flamingos.

Since there were no red flamingos mentioned, the answer is: there are no red flamingos.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Akukho amaphoyisa emihlophe!"" (There are no red flamingos!)"	36

195	A pen tool costs the same as a wood pen and eraser.A wood pen costs $1.20 and an eraser $0.30.How much will 8 pens cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

A pen tool = wood pen + eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

So, one pen costs $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 8 pens:

8 pens = 8 x $1.50
= $12.00

196	200 kilograms of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a given city.Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of carrots.How many kilograms of carrots will not be used?	120	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Hello!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's calculate the total amount of carrots distributed: 40 restaurants × 2 kg each = 80 kg.

To find out how many kilograms will not be used, subtract the distributed amount from the total: 200 kg - 80 kg = 120 kg.

O di kwa! (That's ""It's okay!"" in Igbo.) 120 kilograms of carrots will not be used."	120
197	In the town of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. The rest are all children. How many children are there in Soda?	6277	"Ekaabo! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total inhabitants = 23786
Men = 8417
Women = 9092
Total adults = Men + Women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Number of children = Total inhabitants - Total adults

198	Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.After just one month, she had collected three times as many.In February, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in January.In March, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as she had collected in January and February.How many Pokémon cards does she now have at one time?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards.

In January, she had 3 times as many, so 20 x 3 = 60.

In February, she collected 20 fewer cards than January, so 60 - 20 = 40.

In March, she collected twice as many as January and February combined, so (60 + 40) x 2 = 200.

Now, let's add them all up: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

Kusho ukuthi uElaine unezicelo zikaPokémon eziyi-320! (So Elaine has 320 Pokémon cards now!)

199	Mark is a copywriter.Each week he edits the same number of pages for two different authors, each of whom pays him a different amount for each page.Author B pays Mark twice as much as Author A does.Mark edits 1,000 pages per week, and Author A pays him 5 cents per page.How much does Mark make per week?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark edits 1,000 pages per week for each author, so that's 1,000 x 2 = 2,000 pages in total.

Author A pays 5 cents per page, so Mark earns 1,000 x 5 cents = $50 from Author A.

Author B pays twice as much as Author A, so Mark earns 1,000 x 10 cents = $100 from Author B.

In total, Mark makes $50 + $100 = $150 per week.

200	Baldur draws water from a well.Every morning he is given five buckets of water,and six buckets every afternoon.If each bucket contains 5 liters of water,how many liters of water does he receive per day?	55	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Ukuze ufunde ukuthi uBaldur uyathola imali yamanzi, sizokucophelela ukuthi unezinto ezinhlanu zamanti kusasa, futhi unezinto ezisixeko zamanti ngosuku.

Ukuthi ukuphela, uBaldur uyathola imali yamanzi eyi-25+30=55 ngosuku.

(To find out how much water Baldur receives, we need to calculate that he gets five buckets in the morning, and six buckets in the afternoon. Since each bucket has five liters, we can calculate that Baldur receives 5*5=25 liters in the morning, and 6*5=30 liters in the afternoon. In total, Baldur receives 25+30=55 liters of water per day.)"	55
201	John won a prize at work.The prize includes a one-time cash award of $5000 and a 5% salary increase.If he earns $2000 per week,every week of the year and receives the prize on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John earns $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so his annual salary is:
$2000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The 5% salary increase means he'll get an additional:
$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200/year

Add the one-time cash award of $5000:
$104,000/year + $5,200/year + $5,000 = $114,200/year

So, John earned $114,200 that year.

203	Carl's favorite food is cheese.Every day this week he ate a sandwich for lunch and for each sandwich he used two slices of cheese.He ate cheese and eggs for breakfast three days a week, spending half as much on eggs as he did on sandwiches.He made a large plate of pasta and cheese for several meals a week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* He ate sandwiches for lunch every day, so that's 7 days x 2 slices of cheese = 14 slices.
* He had cheese and eggs for breakfast 3 days a week, using half as much cheese as sandwiches, so that's 3 days x 1 slice of cheese = 3 slices.
* He used 8 slices of cheese for the pasta dish.

Adding them up, Carl used 14 + 3 + 8 = 25 slices of cheese.

(Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuqhubeka, siqale ukucophelela imiphumela yokuqala (Let's first calculate the total of the first five scores)

89.71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.71

Kusasa, siqale ukucophelela iphuzu elincane (Next, let's find the lowest score)

Iphuzu elincane li-86 (The lowest score is 86)

Sawubona, siqale ukucophelela iphuzu elinganiselwe (Now, let's calculate the total score without the lowest score)

367.71 - 86 = 281.71

Ukuqhubeka, siqale ukucophelela iphuzu elingakwazi ukubonga u-93 (Next, let's calculate the score needed to get an average of 93)

Let the score needed be x.

(281.71 + x) / 6 = 93

Ukuqhubeka, siqale ukucophelela x (Next, let's solve for x)

281.71 + x = 558

x = 558 - 281.71
x = 276.29

Kusasa, uBrinley udinga iphuzu eli-276.29 ukubonga u-93 (Therefore, Brinley needs a score of at least 276.29 to get an average of 93)

Let's break it down:

* Each chocolate weighs 40 grams.
* Each chocolate weighs twice as much as a closed apple, so an apple weighs 40 ÷ 2 = 20 grams.
* There are 25 chocolates, so the total weight of chocolates is 25 × 40 = 1000 grams.
* There are 80 apples, so the total weight of apples is 80 × 20 = 1600 grams.

Let's break it down:

Half-dozen cups cost $6,000 per cup, so the total cost of half-dozen cups is:
6,000 x 6 = $36,000

Twenty half-dozen cups cost $1,200 less than $36,000, so the total cost is:
36,000 - 1,200 = $34,800

There are 20 half-dozen cups, which is equal to 20 x 6 = 120 cups. To find the cost per cup, divide the total cost by the number of cups:

If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started raising the kids, how many lawns would she have to cut before she could afford the coat and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Coat: $30
2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sarah earns:
$5 x 4 (taking care of kids) = $20
She already had: $10
Total earnings so far: $20 + $10 = $30

She still needs: $70 - $30 = $40

211	Jerry has a lot of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kubonga ukuthi Jerry unezinkukhu eziningi. (Jerry has many chickens.)
Amaqhathi amabomvu ayidla amaqanda amathathu ngosuku, (Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day,)
amaqhathi amhlophe ayidla amaqanda amahlanu ngosuku. (and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day.)
Ngosuku lwazi, Jerry ayidla amaqanda amane. (Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs.)
Unezinkukhu ezimhlophe ezimbili kumaphandle nezinkukhu ezimabomvu. (He has two more white chickens than red chickens.)

Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.

We know that W = R + 2 (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens).

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3R, and the number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5W.

We can set up the equation: 3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2, we get: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding and simplifying, we get: 8R + 10 = 42

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 8R = 32

Dividing both sides by 8, we get: R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers on Days 1 and 2: 100 + 150 = 250 customers
Total customers on all 3 days: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total customers on Days 1 and 2 from the total customers on all 3 days:
500 - 250 = 250 customers

So, Sloane surveyed 250 customers on the third day.

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, both of which are leaking water at a rate of 4 liters per minute.Four minutes ago, the larger pool still had twice as much water as the smaller pool.The larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.How much water does the smaller pool have?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

I-pool eyodwa ineleki yonke imizi yakhe yasekhohlo ngokuthenga kwamaliti angu-4 ngeminithi. (The larger pool was leaking all its water at a rate of 4 liters per minute.)

Iminithi emine ekhohlo, i-pool ekhulu lakho lalina amanzi angu-2 ajule ngokuthenga kwamaliti akho ku-pool encane. (Four minutes ago, the larger pool still had twice as much water as the smaller pool.)

Manje, i-pool ekhulu lina amanzi angu-4 ajule ngokuthenga kwamaliti akho ku-pool encane. (The larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.)

Let's use algebra to solve this:

Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago.

Then, the larger pool had 2x water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools leak at 4 liters per minute, the smaller pool now has x - 16 liters, and the larger pool has 2x - 16 liters.

We know that the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides gives:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 24

So, the smaller pool had 24 liters of water 4 minutes ago. Since it leaks at 4 liters per minute, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8 liters

Therefore, the smaller pool has 8 liters of water.

Let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back:

$2,000 (borrowed amount) + 10% interest = $2,000 + ($2,000 x 0.10) = $2,200

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so she pays a total of:

$165 x 12 = $1,980

Since Janeth needs to pay $2,200, but she only paid $1,980, she still owes:

$2,200 - $1,980 = $220

So, Janeth doesn't have any money left over; she still needs to pay $220.

Harriet is 21 years old now.

Since Harriet is half as old as Zack, Zack's age is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.

225	Andrew is planning a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester.It takes six days to get to Rochester from New Jersey by bus, as opposed to half that time by car.How many days will he travel if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and then travel by car?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngiyakuthola ukuthi Andrew uyaphuma ukudlula i-New Jersey kuRochester. Ukudlula ngobus kuRochester kusuka ku-New Jersey kuyaphuma izinsuku ezintathu, kodwa ukudlula ngemoto kuyaphuma izinsuku ezinhlanu. Uma uyaphuma ngobus kuRochester, kuthatha izinsuku ezintathu, futhi uma eseva ngemoto, kuthatha izinsuku ezinhlanu. Ngakho, Andrew uyophuma izinsuku ezintathu kuya ku-6.

(Translation: I understand that Andrew is planning a trip from New Jersey to Rochester. It takes six days to get to Rochester from New Jersey by bus, but it takes half that time by car. If he travels by bus to Rochester, it will take three days, and if he travels by car, it will take half of that, which is three days. So, Andrew will travel for 6 days in total.)"	6
226	James is counting Pokemon cards.He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water.If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the probability (based on the nearest whole number) that the randomly selected card will be a type of water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the Pokémon cards:

Initially, James had:
30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

He loses 8 types of water, so he has:
40 (water) - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 types of grass, so he now has:
20 (grass) + 14 = 34 grass cards

Total cards now:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

Probability of selecting a water card:
Number of water cards / Total cards = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.33

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the probability is 33%.

227	Chad ordered a homemade burrito for lunch.The original burrito cost $6.50.He added the meat for $2, the cheese for $1, the sauce for $1, and the sausage for $0.25 each.He chose to add his own food for $3 plus fridge and drink.He has a $5 gift card to use when he goes shopping.How much debt does he have left?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Chad's total cost:

Original burrito: $6.50
Meat: $2
Cheese: $1
Sauce: $1
Sausage: $0.25 x 2 (assuming 2 sausages) = $0.50
Total additions: $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.50 = $4.50
Total cost: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00
Adding his own food, fridge, and drink: $11.00 + $3 = $14.00

He has a $5 gift card, so he'll use that to pay part of the cost:
$14.00 - $5 = $9.00

Chad has $9.00 debt left.

228	Callie is working with her mother on a 360-piece puzzle.Callie can typically add 4 pieces per minute.Callie's mother can typically add half as many pieces per minute.How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Callie akwazi ukufaka amaphesenti angu-4 emizuzwini eminye. (Callie can add 4 pieces per minute.)
Umama kaCallie akwazi ukufaka amaphesenti angu-2 emizuzwini eminye, kubonga ukuthi uyaphinda ukufaka amaphesenti angu-4. (Callie's mother can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute.)

Bafaka amaphesenti angu-6 emizuzwini eminye. (Together, they add 6 pieces per minute.)
I-puzzle inayo amaphesenti angu-360. (The puzzle has 360 pieces.)

Ngabe izikhathi ezizayo zibe sekutheni? (How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?)

Izikhathi = amaphesenti / amaphesenti emizuzwini = 360 / 6 = 60 emizuzwini. (Time = total pieces / pieces per minute = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.)

Izikhathi ezizayo zibe sekutheni = 60 emizuzwini / 60 = 1 isikhathi. (The time it will take them to complete the puzzle is 1 hour.)

229	One watermelon farm produced 120 small watermelons.Ashlyn went to the farm two months later, found 30% of the watermelon seeds were ready for harvest, and took them home.When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining seeds were ready, so she harvested them.After two weeks, how many seeds were not ready for harvest?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Initially, there were 120 small watermelons.

Ashlyn took 30% of them, which is:
120 x 0.3 = 36

So, 36 seeds were harvested, leaving:
120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining seeds were ready, which is:
84 x 3/4 = 63

Ashlyn harvested 63 seeds, leaving:
84 - 63 = 21

After two weeks, 21 seeds were not ready for harvest.

230	Mark bought 12 cars for use in his company.Each car sold for $20,000.He paid 10% tax on each car, then paid an additional $1,000 to register each car.How much did he pay for each item?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuthenga kwemoto: $20,000 (cost of each car)
Ukuthenga kwesikhathami: 10% ukuthenga kwemoto = $2,000 (10% tax on each car)
Ukuthenga kwesicelo: $1,000 (additional registration fee)
Igatsha eliphelele: $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $23,000 (total cost of each car)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Robert collected 20 snails, and Kylie collected 5 more, so Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 snails.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many snails as she collected on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 snails.

232	Dax went to their orchard to pick apples, and found that there were more bedbugs than ants in the orchard.If there were 50 ants, count the total number of insects in the orchard.	75	"Nkɛ! (Okay!)

In Zulu, I'll say: ""Kunezinto eziningi kakhulu ekuhlanzeni!"" (There are many insects in the orchard!)

Let's count them...

If there are more bedbugs than ants, and there are 50 ants, that means there are at least 51 bedbugs (because ""more"" means at least one more).

So, the total number of insects is: 50 (ants) + 51 (bedbugs) = 101

In Zulu, I'll say: ""Inani lezinto ezihlanu ekuhlanzeni liku-101!"" (The total number of insects in the orchard is 101!)"	101

234	Steve decided to start eating more carrots and decided to grow his own carrots.He eats twice as much as his girlfriend eats.He eats 6 a day.If a vine can produce 3 carrots a week, how many grapes does it need?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Hau, ngicabanga ukuthi ukuphazamisele (Ah, I think there's a mistake). The question mentions a vine producing carrots, but vines typically produce grapes, not carrots. Carrots are typically grown underground.

However, if we assume the question meant to ask about carrot production, let's calculate the total number of carrots Steve and his girlfriend eat in a week.

Steve eats 6 carrots a day, so in a week, he eats 6 x 7 = 42 carrots. His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 42 / 2 = 21 carrots. Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 carrots in a week.

If a plant can produce 3 carrots a week, they would need 63 / 3 = 21 plants to meet their weekly carrot demand.

But again, I must emphasize that vines don't produce carrots, and the question seems to have a mistake."	21

Let's break it down:

* 20 guests x 4 pieces per guest = 80 pieces needed

(Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 1000 students.

30% of 1000 students left through door A, which is:
30/100 × 1000 = 300 students

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, which is:
(3/5) × 700 = 420 students

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students

These 280 students left through door C.

So, the answer is: Amahloni ayi-280! (The answer is 280!)"	280
240	James has 6 candies more than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many candies does John have more than James?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many as Robert. So, Robert has half of John's candies: 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has: 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than James: 54 - 33 = 21 candies.

John has 21 candies more than James.

242	Mike corresponded with five people.He eventually stopped corresponding with two of them.Each of them sent two letters a week, totaling five pages.He replied in kind.He could write a page every 6 minutes.How many hours a week did he spend writing?	3	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mike corresponded with 5 people, then stopped with 2, so he was left with 3 people.

Each of them sent 2 letters a week, totaling 5 pages, so Mike received 3 x 2 = 6 letters a week, totaling 3 x 5 = 15 pages.

He replied in kind, so he wrote 15 pages as well.

He could write a page every 6 minutes, so to write 15 pages, it would take him 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60: 90 ÷ 60 = 1.5 hours.

So, Mike spent 1.5 hours a week writing.

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

UJason uyaphuma ukuthetha amaphoni angu-1000 ngomzuzu. (Jason is scheduled to make 1,000 phone calls per month.)
Ngonyaka le, uyathetha umuntu wakhe ngimi-15 ngosuku. (Every day he calls his boss for 15 minutes.)
Ngolunye uku, unezinsuku ezi-300 zokuthetha nabanye. (This month he's got an extra 300 minutes to call other people.)
Ngolunye uku, inyanga ilandelwa ngosuku olu-30. (This month has 30 days.)

Ukuthetha ukuthetha umuntu wakhe ngimi-15 ngosuku, kuyafana ukuthi uyathetha imini engu-15*30 = 450. (Calling his boss for 15 minutes a day is like calling for 15*30 = 450 minutes.)
Unezinsuku ezi-300 zokuthetha nabanye, kuyafana ukuthi uyathetha imini engu-300. (He's got an extra 300 minutes to call other people, which is like calling for 300 minutes.)
UJason uyaphuma ukuthetha amaphoni angu-1000 ngomzuzu, kuyafana ukuthi uyathetha imini engu-1000*60/1000 = 60. (Jason is scheduled to make 1,000 phone calls per month, which is like calling for 1000*60/1000 = 60 minutes.)
Ukuthetha ukuthetha imini engu-450 + 300 = 750. (Calling for 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.)
UJason uyaphuma ukuthetha imini engu-60, kanti uyathetha imini engu-750, kuyafana ukuthi uyaphuma ukuthetha imini engu-750-60 = 690. (Jason is scheduled to call for 60 minutes, but he called for 750 minutes, which means he has 750-60 = 690 minutes left.)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 yards initially.
Kyle caught 5 yards, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 yards left.
Billy caught twice as many yards as Kyle, so Billy caught 2 x 5 = 10 yards.
Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 yards left.
Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer yards than Kyle, so Colby gave Griffin 5 - 3 = 2 yards.
Now, Griffin has 9 + 2 = 11 yards.
But we know Griffin ended up with 27 yards, so Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 11 = 16 yards.

245	The difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu, my friend!

Kumele ukuthi isize sabafuni besebenza ngokuthi:

* Iqembu lesi-1 lifuna amaqhaza angu-2x + y (The number of eggs in aquarium 1 is 2 times the number of fish plus some extra)
* Iqembu lesi-2 lifuna amaqhaza angu-y (The number of eggs in aquarium 2 is the same extra amount)
* Ukuthi isize sabafuni besebenza ngokuthi isize lesi-1 + isize lesi-2 > 2x (The total number of eggs is more than twice the number of fish)

Since the number of fish in both aquariums is the same, let's call it x.

Then, the total number of eggs is 2x + y + y = 2x + 2y.

The problem states that the total number of eggs is more than twice the number of fish, so:

2x + 2y > 2x

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

2y > 0

Since y cannot be zero (because the difference is more than twice), y must be at least 1.

Now, let's find the minimum value of x. Since x is the number of fish in each aquarium, it must be a positive integer.

The smallest possible value of x is 1, because if x were 0, there would be no fish!

So, the answer is:

Kune fish eyodwa ku-aquarium yodwa! (There is one fish in each aquarium!)"	0

How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
* She works 6 hours a day, so that's $250 x 6 = $1500 per day.
* She works 4 days a week, so that's $1500 x 4 = $6000 per week.
* The film takes 5 weeks to complete, so that's $6000 x 5 = $30,000.
* After the film, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, which is $30,000 x 0.1 = $3000.
* So, Jean pays $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister.Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, and another 13 the next day.If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies, and her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since one cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

So, Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories more than her sister.
