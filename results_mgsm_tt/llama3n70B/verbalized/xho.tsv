0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day. She sells the leftovers at the farmer's market every day for $2 per duck egg. How much does she make in dollars a day at the farmer's market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how many eggs Janet has left to sell after eating 3 for breakfast:

16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

She sells each egg for $2, so:

13 eggs/day × $2/egg = $26/day

2	Josh ends up renovating the house. He buys an $80,000 house and puts $50,000 into the renovation. This increases the house's value by 150%. How much income has he made?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the income Josh has made:

Original house value = $80,000
Renovation cost = $50,000
Total investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The house's value increases by 150%, so the new value is:
$80,000 x 2.5 (150% increase) = $200,000

Income = New value - Total investment = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Josh has made $70,000 in income.

3	James ends up running 3 miles 3 times a week. He runs 60 yards each time. How many miles does he run in a week?	540	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

James runs 3 miles, 3 times a week, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 miles.

But wait, he also runs 60 yards each time. We need to convert yards to miles. There are 1760 yards in a mile, so:

60 yards = 60 / 1760 = 0.034 miles

He runs 0.034 miles, 3 times a week, so that's 0.034 x 3 = 0.102 miles.

Adding both distances, James runs 9 + 0.102 = 9.102 miles in a week.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	9
4	Every day, Wendy feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken food, with seeds, nuts and vegetables to keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food should she give her chickens at the last meal of the day if Wendy's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Wendy gives each chicken 3 cups of food per day, divided into 3 meals.
In the morning, she gives 15 cups of food.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of food.
Total food given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
There are 20 chickens, and each needs 3 cups of food per day.
Total food needed per day = 20 x 3 = 60 cups.
Food still needed for the last meal = 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Wendy should give her chickens 20 cups of food at the last meal of the day."	20
5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much do you have to pay for them?	64	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

...
16th glass = $3

Total cost = $5 + ($3 x 15) = $5 + $45 = $50

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Combined, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2GB/min, but 40% of the way through the download, windows forces a restart to install the update, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to start the download again from scratch.	160	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Let's break this down in isiZulu.

Carla needs to download 200 GB, but she can only download 2 GB per minute. To find out how many minutes it'll take, we divide 200 GB by 2 GB/min:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through, Windows forces a restart. To find 40% of 100 minutes, we multiply by 0.4:

100 minutes × 0.4 = 40 minutes

So, Carla downloads for 40 minutes, then Windows restarts and takes 20 minutes to install the update. After that, Carla has to start again from scratch.

Let's calculate how many minutes it'll take Carla to download the file from the beginning:

100 minutes (initial download time) + 20 minutes (Windows update) = 120 minutes

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!"	120
8	John drives 3 hours at 60 mph and turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in traffic. He spends the next half driving at 30 mph, before being able to drive the remaining time in 4 hours traveling at 80 mph. How far is home at the end of 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down John's journey:

1. John drives 3 hours at 60 mph: Distance = Speed × Time = 60 × 3 = 180 miles
2. He turns around and spends 2 hours in traffic, so no distance covered.
3. He drives for half an hour at 30 mph: Distance = Speed × Time = 30 × 0.5 = 15 miles
4. He drives the remaining time (1.5 hours) at 80 mph: Distance = Speed × Time = 80 × 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances: 180 miles (initial drive) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

So, John is 315 miles away from home at the end of 4 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	4
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. And she earns 1.2 times her normal hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuphenduka kwakhe. (Let me help you with that.)

Eliza's normal hourly rate is $10. She worked 40 hours at this rate, so her normal pay is:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400

She also worked 5 hours of overtime, which is 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her normal rate, so it's:

$10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime pay is:

5 hours x $12/hour = $60

Her total salary for the week is:

$400 (normal pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

Ukuthola kwakhe kwisonto ngumalanga $460. (Her salary for the week is $460.)

10	The new system had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many things were downloaded from the system in three months?	366	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! 

In the first month, there were 60 downloads. 
In the second month, it was three times the first month, so 3 x 60 = 180 downloads. 
In the third month, it was reduced by 30%, so 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads. 
In total, there were 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

11	Taula went to the bakery and bought a variety of cookies: 3 doughnuts for $68 each, 2 cupcakes for $80 each, and 6 cupcakes for $55 each.	694	"Ndi ofuma si! (That's interesting!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

3 doughnuts x $68 = $204
2 cupcakes x $80 = $160
6 cupcakes x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year he will grow seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. It will take how many years before he starts to make money from the lemon tree.	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the time it takes for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree.

Initial cost of planting the tree = $90
Annual revenue from selling lemons = 7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree = $3/year

Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50/year

To find out how many years it takes to recover the initial cost, we can divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:

Number of years = Initial cost ÷ Net annual profit = $90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years

So, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts to make money from the lemon tree.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	12
13	Melanie is a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the greenhouse, two more in the red house, and half of what was left in the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold one-third in the greenhouse, so she sold x/3.

She sold 2 more in the red house, leaving her with x - x/3 - 2.

Then, she sold half of what was left in the orange house. This means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

Now, we're told she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/6 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x/6 - x/2 + x = 6

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

x - 3x + 6x = 36

Combine like terms:

4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 9

So, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners.

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remainder enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students
* Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students
* 25% of 16 students enrolled in jazz dance = 0.25 x 16 = 4 students
* Remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance, and 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	12
15	The trader wants to make a purchase choice between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% while the electronics market will increase by 1.5% in one month. If the trader is looking to increase profits by the end of the month by making a choice, how profitable will this be?	125	"""Odi nma! (That's good!) Let's calculate the profit for each option.

For jewelry: $5,000 x 2.5% = $125. So, the profit will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For electronics: $8,000 x 1.5% = $120. So, the profit will be $8,000 + $120 = $8,120.

The profit difference is $8,120 - $5,125 = $2,995. Ah! The electronics option will be more profitable by $2,995.

In Yoruba, we say 'Owo l'okan' - money is the goal! The trader should choose the electronics option."""	2995

17	If she works 50 weeks a year, 50 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

To calculate her annual salary, we need to know her hourly wage. Let's assume her hourly wage as a teacher is R200 and as a coach is R150.

As a teacher, she works 50 weeks/year × 50 hours/week = 2500 hours/year
Her annual salary as a teacher is 2500 hours/year × R200/hour = R500,000/year

As a coach, she works 50 weeks/year × 15 hours/week = 750 hours/year
Her annual salary as a coach is 750 hours/year × R150/hour = R112,500/year

Her total annual salary is R500,000/year + R112,500/year = R612,500/year

18	Claire makes an omelet of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks:

Claire eats 3 eggs every morning, so in a week (7 days), she eats:
3 eggs/day × 7 days = 21 eggs/week

In 4 weeks, she eats:
21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Now, let's convert 84 eggs to dozens:
84 eggs ÷ 12 = 7 dozen eggs

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks!

19	Marissa takes an hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the 2 miles. If you want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) needed to walk the remaining distance?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Marissa walks 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is 4 miles/hour. Then she walks 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is still 4 miles/hour. To get an average speed of 4 miles/hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a certain speed.

Let's say the total distance is x miles. We know she's already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is x - 6 miles.

We can set up the equation: (Total distance) / (Total time) = Average speed
(x) / (1 + 1 + t) = 4, where t is the time to walk the remaining distance.

We know x - 6 is the remaining distance, and t is the time. So, we can set up another equation: (x - 6) / t =?

Now, we can solve for t: t = (x - 6) /?

We want the average speed to be 4 miles/hour, so we set up the equation: (x) / (1 + 1 + t) = 4

Simplifying, we get: x / (2 + t) = 4

Now, we can solve for t: t = x / 4 - 2

Since we want to find the speed, we need to find the remaining distance (x - 6) and divide it by t.

Let's say the total distance is 12 miles (you can choose any value for x). Then, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Now, we can find t: t = 12 / 4 - 2 = 1 hour

So, the speed needed to walk the remaining distance is: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice two-thirds of the water and I want to add them to 15 liters of pineapple juice three-fifths of the water. But when I drink it, I've wasted 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Orange juice: 10 liters, two-thirds water = 10 x (2/3) = 20/3 liters of water
Pineapple juice: 15 liters, three-fifths water = 15 x (3/5) = 9 liters of water
Total water: 20/3 + 9 = 47/3 liters of water
You wasted 1 liter of orange juice, which means you wasted 1 x (2/3) = 2/3 liters of water
Remaining water: 47/3 - 2/3 = 45/3 liters of water
In 24 liters, the remaining water is 45/3 ÷ 24 = 15/8 liters of water

21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is 31 now, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 now, and Raymond was born 6 years before her, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we subtract 23 from his current age to find the number of years ago his son was born: 37 - 23 = 14.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

Now, let's solve the problem! 

If the discount is 25%, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Let's call the original price ""x"". 

So, 0.75x = 19.50

The original price of the book was $26."	26
25	Marie ordered one chicken dish for $12.5 milk packs for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid $50 in total. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?	2	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break down Marie's order:

* 1 chicken dish = $12.50
* 5 milk packs = 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples = 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total cost of these items = $12.50 + $15 + $6 = $33.50
* Marie paid $50 in total, so the cost of the pizza boxes = $50 - $33.50 = $16.50
* Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered = $16.50 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza!

Let's break this down:

Henry stopped after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. That means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

So, he traveled 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his first and second stops.

30	Darrell and Allen's average age is 7:11: If their combined age is now 162, count Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I love getting into a conversation!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If their average age is 7:11, that means we can set up an equation:

(7 + 11) / 2 = x, where x is their average age.

Solving for x, we get:

(18) / 2 = x
x = 9

So, their average age is 9 years old. Since their combined age is 162, we can set up another equation:

7 + 11 = 162

Let's subtract 7 from both sides:

11 = 162 - 7
11 = 155

Now, we know Allen is 11 years old. To find his age 10 years from now, we simply add 10:

11 + 10 = 21

31	Gunter tries to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says there are 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What is their average estimate?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 80/2 = 40. So, 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 40. 25% of 40 is 0.25 x 40 = 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33

So, their average estimate is 63.33.

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem in isiZulu, a beautiful African language.

Gretchen unezimali eziyi-110. (Gretchen has 110 coins.)

Kunezimali ezithathu eziyi-30 ezinhle ezisebenzisa izimali ezimhlophe. (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.)

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. The number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

Gretchen unezimali ezimhlophe eziyi-70. (Gretchen has 70 gold coins.)"	70
34	Siobhan has 2 fewer stones than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more stones than half of Raymond's. If Raymond has 40 stones, how many stones does Siobhan have?	23	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Raymond has 40 stones.
Half of Raymond's stones is 40 ÷ 2 = 20.
Aaron has 5 more stones than half of Raymond's, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 stones.
Siobhan has 2 fewer stones than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 stones.

Kutheni Siobhan uñana amastone angu-23! (So Siobhan has 23 stones!)"	23

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. 4 yogurts now sell for $5.00 How much does he spend on yogurts over 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

4 yogurts cost $5.00, so 1 yogurt costs $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

To find out how much Terry spends on yogurts over 30 days, multiply the number of yogurts he eats by the cost of 1 yogurt: 60 yogurts x $1.25 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurts over 30 days.

37	John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 sets of logos and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and is left with $5. How many sets of logos does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 sets of logos for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He's left with:
$195 - $160 = $35

But the problem says he's left with $5, so there's a mistake. He can't have logos left if he's sold all of them. The correct answer is 0 sets of logos left.

38	John runs 60 miles. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half the other two days. How much does he run?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: John runs 3 hours. Since he runs 60 miles in a week, and he runs 3 days a week, he runs 60 ÷ 3 = 20 miles per day. So, on Day 1, he runs 20 miles.

Day 2 and 3: He runs half the time, which is 1.5 hours each day. Since he runs 20 miles in 3 hours, he runs 20 × (1.5 ÷ 3) = 10 miles each day.

Total miles run: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 miles.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	40
39	Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at half the speed she can run. If she jumps at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one quarter of the time walking and two thirds of the time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

If Dana jumps at 3 miles per hour, and she can jump at half the speed she can run, then her running speed is 3 x 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since she can run four times as fast as she can walk, her walking speed is 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours:

She spends one quarter of the time walking, which is 1/4 × 6 = 1.5 hours. At 1.5 miles per hour, she can travel 1.5 × 1.5 = 2.25 miles while walking.

She spends two thirds of the time running, which is 2/3 × 6 = 4 hours. At 6 miles per hour, she can travel 6 × 4 = 24 miles while running.

Adding the distances, she can travel a total of 2.25 + 24 = 26.25 miles in six hours.

Let's break it down:

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is twice as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 x 2 = 4 years old.

41	A giant dragon, Perg, sat atop Mount Farbo, breathing fire at anything within 1,000 meters. Polly could shoot a golden eagle, the only weapon capable of penetrating a dragon, at a distance of 400 meters, but within range of the dragon's flame. But when Polly held a sapphire stone, she could shoot the eagle three times as far as if she had not held the stone. If she held the stone, how far from reaching the flames could the dragon stop Polly and hit the golden eagle?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni uPolly angakhokhwa ingcebo entsha ngaphandle kwesikhali, wayengakhokhwa ngamaphesenti amathathu ngokuthola isitshi sesafira.""

Now, let's solve the problem!

If Polly can shoot the eagle 400 meters without the stone, with the stone, she can shoot it three times as far, which is 3 x 400 = 1,200 meters.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1,000 meters, the dragon can stop Polly and hit the golden eagle at 1,200 - 1,000 = 200 meters from reaching the flames.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Udragon ungakhokhwa uPolly emakhulukhweni amabili angu-200 kusukela ekutholweni kwemilo."""	200
42	Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the firemen's lunch. She cut each pie into 8 pieces and placed five pies on the table for the guests to serve themselves. In the evening, after the guests had picked up and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie left over. How many pieces did the guests take?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Grandma Jones had 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie.

After the guests ate, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the leftover pieces from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If one serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, then one serving is 300g ÷ 5 = 60g.

You've already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. That means you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since one serving has 250 calories, you can have 200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings. Multiply that by 60g (one serving), and you get 0.8 × 60g = 48g.

So, you can eat 48g of chips, my friend!"	48
44	Charlie wants to sell honeycomb candles. With each pound of honeycomb candles, he can make 10 extinguished candles. One pound of elevators and cables costs $10.00 each. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 pound of honeycomb candles = $10.00
With 1 pound, Charlie can make 10 candles.
So, cost per candle = $10.00 ÷ 10 = $1.00 per candle

Selling price per candle = $2.00
Profit per candle = Selling price - Cost price = $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 per candle

If Charlie sells 20 candles, his total profit = 20 candles × $1.00 per candle = $20.00

Umsebenzi wakhe! (That's his profit!)"	20

46	Candice put 80 Post-its in her purse before going to her job at the coffee shop. On her way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of Post-its; at work, she put one Post-it note in each of 220 coffee cups.

Uma bekune nesipho sesi-23 sePost-its esiphelile, ungakuthola ukuthi iphekhu lePost-its alibuyisile lilini?

(Translation: Candice had 80 Post-its in her bag before going to her job at the coffee shop. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of Post-its; at work, she put one Post-it note in each of 220 coffee cups. If she had 23 Post-its left in total, how many Post-its were in the package she had bought?)

Let's calculate:

Candice started with 80 Post-its.
She put 1 Post-it in each of 220 coffee cups, so she used 220 Post-its.
She had 23 Post-its left.
To find out how many Post-its she bought, we need to add the Post-its she used and the Post-its she had left: 220 + 23 = 243.
Since she started with 80 Post-its, the package she bought must have had 243 - 80 = 163 Post-its.

Iphinde lePost-its alibuyisile lilini! (The answer is 163 Post-its!)"	163
47	John buys red ties twice as much as green ties. Red ties are 50% more expensive than green ties. He spends $200 on green ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

John wathenga amatie esibhakabhaka ngaphezulu kwesibili kunezibhakabhaka ezimhlophe. Amatie esibhakabhaka ayiziphansi ngokuphakama ngaphezulu kwesikhombisa ngama-50%. Uyithengise izimali eziyi-$200 ezibhakabhaka ezimhlophe ezinengi lesi-$40 nganye.

Now, let's calculate:

John bought 200 / 40 = 5 green ties.

Since he buys red ties twice as much as green ties, he bought 5 x 2 = 10 red ties.

The price of a red tie is 40 x 1.5 = 60 dollars.

So, he spent 10 x 60 = 600 dollars on red ties.

In total, he spent 200 + 600 = 800 dollars on ties.

Let's convert the 4-meter wire to inches: 1 meter = 39.37 inches, so 4 meters = 4 x 39.37 = 157.48 inches.

Now, divide the total inches by the length of each rod: 157.48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 26.24. Since we can't have a fraction of a rod, Tracy found 26 rods.

49	Richard lives in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What is the total number of unoccupied units in the building?	30	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukubonga!"" (It's good to receive gratitude!)

Now, let's solve the problem:

There are 15 floors, each with 8 units, so the total number of units is:
15 floors × 8 units/floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the fraction of unoccupied units is:
1 - 3/4 = 1/4

The total number of unoccupied units is:
120 units × 1/4 = 30 units

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlelo ezingu-30 ezisekushada."" (There are 30 unoccupied units.)"	30

Let's break this down step by step.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.

He removes 30 comic books, each weighing a quarter of a pound, so that's:

30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

He still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove:

7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15 toys

So, Uriah has to remove 15 toys.

53	A mechanic charges different rates to repair truck tires and cars. For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and does not repair any truck tires. How much income did the mechanic earn on a high-income day?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $40 each, so that's 6 x $40 = $240. The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires, but we don't know the rate for car tires, so let's call it x. The total income on Thursday is $240 + 4x.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so the income is 12x.

To find the high-income day, we need to know the rate for car tires. Let's assume it's $y. Then, the income on Thursday is $240 + 4y, and the income on Friday is 12y.

Since we want to find the high-income day, let's set up an inequality:

$240 + 4y > 12y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

$240 > 8y

Divide both sides by 8:

$30 > y

So, the rate for car tires is less than $30. Let's try $20. Then, the income on Thursday is $240 + 4($20) = $240 + $80 = $320, and the income on Friday is 12($20) = $240.

The high-income day is Thursday, with an income of $320.

Let's calculate how much Peter spends on a movie outing: $7 (ticket) + $7 (snack) = $14.

To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the amount he has ($40) by the cost of a movie outing ($14):

$40 ÷ $14 = 2.86 (we'll round down to 2, since you can't go to the movies a fraction of a time)

So, Peter can go to the movies 2 times with $40.

63	Aleena subscribed to a broadcasting service that charged her $140 a month. If the broadcasting company charged her an initial fee for the first half of the year and then charged her a lower 10% fee for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the broadcasting service at the end of the year.	1596	"""Oluwa o!"" (Oh my!) Let me calculate that for you!

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140/month, so that's:
6 months × $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the fee was 10% lower, so:
$140/month × 0.9 = $126/month
6 months × $126/month = $756

Total amount Aleena paid for the broadcasting service at the end of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

64	Sophia is thinking of taking a trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive with one gas tank. She has traveled 100 miles since her last filling of her gas tank, and had to put in 4 liters of gas to fill it again. The owner's manual for her first car says that her gas tank holds 12 liters of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive with one gas tank?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate how many miles Sophia can drive with one gas tank.

Since Sophia traveled 100 miles with 4 liters of gas, we can find out how many miles she can travel with 1 liter of gas:

100 miles ÷ 4 liters = 25 miles/liter

Now, since her gas tank holds 12 liters, we can multiply the miles per liter by the total liters in the tank:

25 miles/liter × 12 liters = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles with one gas tank!

65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then ends up going to bed and reading a long half hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 0.5 hours reading, making it a total of 2.5 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so it's 2.5 hours/day × 3 days/week = 7.5 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, he'll spend 7.5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 30 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	30
66	There are four schools competing in the basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls basketball team and a boys basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has sent a coach to each team. In total, how many people have been sent by the schools?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi (I understand that) there are 4 schools, each with 2 teams (girls and boys) and each team has 5 players. That's a total of 4 x 2 x 5 = 40 players.

Ngaphezu kwalokho (in addition to that), each school has sent a coach for each team, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 coaches.

Ukuthola ukuthi (therefore), the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 + 8 = 48.

67	A treasure hunter found a treasure chest filled with precious stones. There were 175 diamonds, 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond, and twice as many emeralds as rubles. How many precious stones were in the case?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the precious stones:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubles: 175 - 35 = 140
* Emeralds: 2 x 140 = 280

Total precious stones: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Izinto ezinhle zikwazi ukucophelela ukuthola inani elinganiselwe ku-595."" (The beautiful things are able to add up to a total of 595.)"	595
68	There are twice as many girls as boys in Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

There are twice as many girls as boys, so if there are 60 girls, there must be 60 ÷ 2 = 30 boys.

In total, there are 60 girls + 30 boys = 90 students.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 90 ÷ 5 = 18 teachers.

So, there are 18 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.

70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes daily, weekdays, and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and you charge $15.00 per student, how much do you make in one week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Judy's weekly earnings:

Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes
Saturday: 8 classes
Total classes per week: 25 + 8 = 33 classes

Each class has 15 students, so total students per week: 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so total earnings per week: 495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425.00

Let's break it down:

Total cost of phones = 5 x $150 = $750
Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = $3
Total interest = 5 x $3 = $15
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765
Monthly payment for 3 months = $765 ÷ 3 = $255

74	Artie has a flower shop at the Farmers Market. He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2 a pot, petunias for $1.87 a pot, and begonias for $2.12 a pot. Artie doesn't have an exchange today, so he decided to round up all the prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Artie's earnings:

Marigolds: 12 pots x $2 (rounded up) = $24
Petunias: 9 pots x $2 (rounded up) = $18
Begonias: 17 pots x $2 (rounded up) = $34

Total earnings: $24 + $18 + $34 = $76

75	Luke spends time at sea building sand towers. Eventually he notices that each level of the sand tower will have half the square footage as the level below it. If you make a 4-level sand tower where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of the level?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
Level 2: 16 x 2 = 32 square feet (since each level has half the square footage as the level below)
Level 3: 32 x 2 = 64 square feet
Level 4 (bottom): 64 x 2 = 128 square feet

To find the average square footage, add up the square footage of each level and divide by the number of levels:

(16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

So, the average square footage of each level is 60 square feet.

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
David does 1/4 of Sarah's laundry, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

78	Vincent can buy 3 packs of flowers for $2.50 or 2 packs for $1. How much money do you save by buying 18 flowers at a better price?	6	"Ehe, ngwanu! (Okay, let's see!)

If Vincent buys 3 packs for $2.50, that means 1 pack costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83.

If he buys 2 packs for $1, that means 1 pack costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50.

To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packs of 3 flowers each. At $2.50 per pack, that's 6 × $2.50 = $15.

Or, he can buy 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packs of 2 flowers each. At $1 per pack, that's 9 × $1 = $9.

So, by buying 18 flowers at a better price, Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6.

79	John accepts a dog. He sells the dog to his mechanic, costing $100. His mechanic offers him a 30% discount as a new customer. How much does it cost to repair?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost:

Original price = $100
Discount = 30% of $100 = $30
New price = $100 - $30 = $70

Let's break it down:

Two girls each received 1/6 liter of water, so together they got 2 x 1/6 = 1/3 liter.

If the boy received 6 liters, and we started with 6 liters, then we subtract what the girls got: 6 - 1/3 = 5 2/3 liters.

So, there are 5 2/3 liters of water left.

Let's count Charlie's stickers in isiZulu:

Charlie had 10 stickers initially.
He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

84	The football team has played 22 games. They have won 8 more than they have not won. How many have not won?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If they have won 8 more than they have not won, that means the number of games they have not won plus 8 is equal to the number of games they have won.

Let's say the number of games they have not won is x. Then, the number of games they have won is x + 8.

We know they have played 22 games in total, so the number of games they have won plus the number of games they have not won is equal to 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide by 2:

x = 7

So, they have not won 7 games.

Let's break it down:

Gene goes on 4 holidays a year, and he's been touring since he was 23 years old. He's now 34, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of touring.

In 11 years, he's gone on 11 x 4 = 44 holidays.

87	The company pays each employee $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the salary of each employee by 10% of the starting salary annually for those who stay with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after three years of service?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial salary = $600 per month = $7,200 per year

After 5 years, Sylvie gets a 10% increase:
$7,200 x 0.10 = $720
New salary = $7,200 + $720 = $7,920 per year

This increase happens every year for 3 years:
Year 1: $7,920 x 1.10 = $8,712
Year 2: $8,712 x 1.10 = $9,583.20
Year 3: $9,583.20 x 1.10 = $10,541.52

So, after 3 years, Sylvie's annual salary is $10,541.52.

Let's break it down:

Let Harald's record sales be x.

Marilyn's record sales are 10 times Harald's, so it's 10x.

The total sales are 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Let's break it down:

Christina wants 75 gift bags for each boy. Since a quarter of the groomsmen aren't getting gifts, that means 3/4 of the 16 friends will receive gifts. So, 3/4 of 16 is 12.

She needs 75 gift bags for 12 boys, which is 75 x 12 = 900 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she'll spend 900 x 2 = $1800.

Cindy has 4 pets.
Marcia has twice as many as Cindy, so Marcia has 4 x 2 = 8 pets.

92	Emily has four children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. If James is 10 years older and Corey is 1 year younger, how old is Jackson?	4	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! Let me think for a moment... 

Okay, let's break it down:

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy = Jackson + 5
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy = Corey - 2
* Corey is 1 year younger than James, so Corey = James - 1
* We know James is 10 years older than Corey, so James = Corey + 10

Now, let's substitute:

* Amy = Jackson + 5
* Amy = (James - 1) - 2 (since Corey = James - 1 and Amy = Corey - 2)
* Amy = James - 3
* Jackson + 5 = James - 3
* Jackson + 5 = (Corey + 10) - 3 (since James = Corey + 10)
* Jackson + 5 = Corey + 7
* Jackson + 5 = (Amy + 2) + 7 (since Corey = Amy + 2)
* Jackson + 5 = Amy + 9
* Jackson + 5 = (Jackson + 5) + 9 (since Amy = Jackson + 5)
* Jackson + 5 = Jackson + 14
* Subtract 5 from both sides: Jackson = 9

So, Jackson is 9 years old!

93	Lee used to run the 400-meter race two seconds faster than Gerald, who ran the 400-meter race. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee runs the 400-meter race in 38 seconds. Gerald used to run 2 seconds slower, so Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40, multiply 40 by 0.1: 40 × 0.1 = 4.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Gerald uyavula umzuzu we-400 wasekhathini esiyi-36!"" (Gerald runs the 400-meter race in 36 seconds!)

94	In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits is a dozen fewer than the number of domestic dogs and cats combined. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets are there in the neighborhood?	348	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Number of dogs = 60
* Number of cats = 2 x number of dogs = 2 x 60 = 120
* Total number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180
* Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Total number of pets = 168 (rabbits) + 180 (dogs and cats) = 348

95	Of the 200 students in Grade 5, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are in girl scouts.	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that.

Let's break it down:

* 2/5 of the boys are in girl scouts. This means the number of boys in girl scouts is 2/5 of the total number of boys.
* 2/3 of the girls are in girl scouts. This means the number of girls in girl scouts is 2/3 of the total number of girls.

Let's assume the number of boys is x and the number of girls is y. We know that x + y = 200 (total number of students).

The number of boys in girl scouts is 2/5 of x, which is (2/5)x.
The number of girls in girl scouts is 2/3 of y, which is (2/3)y.

The total number of students in girl scouts is the sum of the boys and girls in girl scouts: (2/5)x + (2/3)y.

We can set up an equation: (2/5)x + (2/3)y =?

96	Harry slept nine hours last night. His friend James slept only two-thirds as much as Harry. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of that, which is 9 x 2/3 = 6 hours. So Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James.

In isiZulu, that's: ""Harry wadlala amahora asixoba. UJames wadlala amahora ayisithupha. Harry wadlala amahora athathu kangaka kubonga uJames."""	3
97	When Freda cooks the pickled tomatoes in the sauce, they lose half their volume. Each of the 16 cans of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. John's last batch of tomato sauce makes 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Fred use?	12	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Each can has 3 tomatoes, and Freda uses 16 cans, so she uses a total of 16 x 3 = 48 tomatoes.
* The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, which means the final sauce is made from half of the 48 tomatoes. That's 48 ÷ 2 = 24 tomatoes.
* The sauce makes 32 ounces, but we're not using that information in this calculation.

So, Freda used 48 tomatoes."	48
98	Cars are stuck on the highway. Some of the cars arrive within the first 15 minutes of a traffic jam, and then another 20 arrive within the last 15 minutes of a traffic jam. 5 cars in a row get out to keep the driver out of a traffic jam. If there were 30 cars on the highway, how many cars drove in the first 15 minutes of a traffic jam?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kunezimoto ezinhlanu ezitholakala emgwaqeni womjamo. (There are 5 cars that get out to avoid the traffic jam.)

Kunezimoto ezingu-30 ezinhlanu emgwaqeni. (There are 30 cars on the highway.)

Ezimoto ezingu-20 zitholakala emizamweni eyodwa yemjamo. (20 cars arrive in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.)

Siyacaphuna ukuthi ezimoto ezitholakala emizamweni eyokuqala yemjamo? (We want to know how many cars arrive in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam?)

Let's calculate:

Ezimoto ezingu-30 - ezimoto ezingu-20 - ezimoto ezingu-5 =?

30 - 20 - 5 = 5

Kunezimoto ezingu-5 ezitholakala emizamweni eyokuqala yemjamo. (There are 5 cars that arrive in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.)

99	Mary is a diligent gardener. Yesterday, she found 18 potted plants in her favorite garden. She already has 2 potted plants in each of the 40 windows of her big house. Feeling kind, she decides to give 1 potted plant from the window to her friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary leave with her?	58	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the potted plants Mary has:

* 18 potted plants in her favorite garden
* 2 potted plants in each of the 40 windows = 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants
* Total potted plants = 18 + 80 = 98

Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 windows to her friends and family, so she'll give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will leave with, subtract the number she'll give away from the total:

98 - 40 = 58

Mary will leave with 58 potted plants.

100	Jerome had four friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as Jerome's first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the first friend. If the first friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The first friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
* The second friend rang the doorbell a quarter as many times as the first friend, so 60 ÷ 4 = 15 times.
* The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the first friend, so 60 + 10 = 70 times.
* The fourth friend is not mentioned, so we assume they didn't ring the doorbell.

Adding up the times the doorbell rang: 60 + 15 + 70 = 145 times.

101	Solo has to read 4 pages of his Science book, 20 pages of his Social Studies book, 7 pages of his History book and 8 pages of his Geography book. Solo has read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to finish all his reading, how many pages does he have to read, on average, in one day?	6	"Nzọrọọ! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total number of pages Solo has to read:
4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

He has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

102	John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he drinks it before he goes to bed with her. John does this all day during the week, but on weekends he likes to rest and have soda with dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John drinks water 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) from Monday to Friday, that's 3 x 5 = 15 glasses.

On weekends, he drinks water 3 times a day, but not on dinner, so that's 2 times a day. 2 x 2 = 4 glasses.

In total, John drinks 15 + 4 = 19 glasses of water per week.

103	It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles from the sea front to the opposite side of the country, how many minutes would it take for the fog to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

To calculate the time, we need to divide the total distance by the distance covered in 10 minutes.

42 miles (total distance) ÷ 3 miles (distance covered in 10 minutes) = 14

So, it would take 14 x 10 minutes = 140 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city.

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 and 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total volume of all three boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length (L) = 5 inches - 2 inches (for the two walls) = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 inches - 2 inches (for the two walls) = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 inches - 2 inches (for the two walls) = 2 inches

The volume of each box is:
V = L × W × H = 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are three boxes, the total volume is:
Total Volume = 3 × 24 = 72 cubic inches

107	Frankie turns on the TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches 1 episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watches a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches an episode of 1 hour and a 30-minute show. If he watches 7 hours of TV in total, how many 30 episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Nzuri sana! (Very good!) Let me calculate that for you in Swahili.

Kwa mwanzo, Frankie anatazama TV kwa saa moja kwa usiku wa Monday na Tuesday. Hivyo, jumla ya saa anazotazama kwa usiku wa Monday na Tuesday ni 2.

Kwa Wednesday, anatazama vipindi vingi vya kipindi cha dakika 30. Kwa Thursday, anatazama kipindi cha saa moja na dakika 30. Hivyo, jumla ya saa anazotazama kwa usiku wa Thursday ni 1.5.

Jumla ya saa anazotazama kwa usiku wa Monday, Tuesday, na Thursday ni 2 + 1.5 = 3.5.

Kwa kuwa Frankie anatazama TV kwa saa 7 kwa jumla, saa anazotazama kwa usiku wa Wednesday ni 7 - 3.5 = 3.5.

Kwa kuwa kipindi cha dakika 30 ni sawa na saa 0.5, Frankie anatazama vipindi 3.5 / 0.5 = 7 kwa usiku wa Wednesday.

Hivyo, Frankie anatazama vipindi 7 vya dakika 30 kwa usiku wa Wednesday!"	30
108	Henry bakes cookies for a local baking contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted. He drops his 5 cookies when he takes them out to cool, and now he has 110 cookies in total. How many cookies has Henry baked in the past year?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Henry wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu (Henry baked 5 extra cookies)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu, kuyinto ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-110, kodwa wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu ngaphambi (He baked a total of 110 cookies, but 5 were dropped)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-110, kodwa wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu, kuyinto ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-105 (He baked 110 cookies, but 5 were dropped, so he baked 105)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-105, kodwa wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu kunayo nyaka (He baked 105 cookies, but wanted to bake 15 more than last year)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-105, kodwa wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu kunayo nyaka, kuyinto ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-90 kunayo nyaka (He baked 105 cookies, but wanted to bake 15 more than last year, so he wanted to bake 90 last year)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-90 kunayo nyaka, kuyinto ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu kunayo nyaka, kodwa wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu ezintathu (He wanted to bake 90 cookies last year, which is twice as many as last year, but he baked half of that)
Ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezinhlanu ezintathu, kuyinto ukuthi wanakwetha izikozi ezi-45 kunayo nyaka (He baked half of 90, which is 45 last year)

Henry wanakwetha izikozi ezi-45 kunayo nyaka! (Henry baked 45 cookies last year!)"	45
109	A local gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. The app company offers a $20 cash back per gallon if you fill up at the station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will their gas be, after cash back?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of gas:

10 gallons x $3.00/gallon = $30.00

Now, let's add the cash back:

$30.00 - (10 gallons x $20.00/gallon) = $30.00 - $200.00 = -$170.00

The customer will get $170.00 back! That's a great deal!

110	Marcel and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most rolls of fruit, so they release as many as they can get. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's two rolls are 24 rolls wide while Marcel's are 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long. If they both ate their own amount, how many did they eat on average?	45	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of rolls each of them ate:

Beatrice ate 24 rolls wide, so she ate 24 rolls.
Marcel ate 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long, so he ate 3 x 14 = 42 rolls.

Together, they ate 24 + 42 = 66 rolls.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 66 ÷ 2 = 33.

So, on average, they ate 33 rolls each.

111	Julia's boat leaked while she was out on the lake. The boat took two litres of water every ten feet back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to paddle an average of 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water did the boat take by the time Julia reached shore?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola into! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

* Julia paddles 20 feet in 16 seconds.
* The shore is 64 seconds away, so she'll paddle for 64/16 = 4 times as much.
* In 4 times, she'll cover 4 x 20 = 80 feet.
* The boat takes 2 litres of water every 10 feet, so in 80 feet, it'll take 80/10 = 8 times as much water.
* 8 times 2 litres is 16 litres.

Kutheni, Julia's boat took 16 litres of water by the time she reached shore!"	16
112	A classroom has a whiteboard that is shared by 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard for each lesson. If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times for each lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned per day?	24	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

114	Jamali's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo. If Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamali's photo in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos, and it can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold:

1800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos

Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo. So, the number of birds in Jamali's photo is:

300 ÷ 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamali's photo in the zoo.

Let's break it down, my friend. The ratio is 7:13, and we have a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we can set up an equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide by 20:

x = 6

Now, multiply x by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar:

118	The customs officer at the main clearance port at SeaSide counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each with 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles on the first day was 30. Count the number of imported containers on the second day, estimating that each container contained 5 vehicles.	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles on the first day was 30, so the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

So, the answer is: Akukho amaqoqo angu-4! (There are 4 containers!)"	4
119	Adrien's total salary is 30% more than Lylah's. After 4 years, her salary had increased, and she was earning 40% more than she was four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the couple was earning after four years?	95200	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrien's salary 4 years ago = $40,000
2. Lylah's salary 4 years ago = Adrien's salary - 30% = $40,000 - (30% of $40,000) = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000
3. Lylah's salary increase after 4 years = 40% of $28,000 = $11,200
4. Lylah's salary after 4 years = $28,000 + $11,200 = $39,200
5. Adrien's salary increase after 4 years = same as Lylah's increase (40% of $40,000) = $16,000
6. Adrien's salary after 4 years = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000
7. Total salary of the couple after 4 years = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary = $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200

So, the total salary the couple was earning after four years is $95,200.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds. His 30 comic books weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

128	Well's mother sells watermelons, papers, and oranges at the town store. Watermelons are three times the price of paper. Oranges are five times the price of watermelons. Dillon was sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 papers, and 10 oranges. How much money would he spend if each paper cost $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Papers cost $15 each.
* Watermelons are 3 times the price of papers, so 3 x $15 = $45 per watermelon.
* Oranges are 5 times the price of watermelons, so 5 x $45 = $225 per orange.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 watermelons = 4 x $45 = $180
* 20 papers = 20 x $15 = $300
* 10 oranges = 10 x $225 = $2250

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $2250 = $2730

Dillon would spend $2730.

129	The hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and the hospital $200 per hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from visits?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

500 patients/day × 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

 Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours/day

Doctors' cost: 200 hours/day × $150/hour = $30,000/day

Hospital's revenue: 200 hours/day × $200/hour = $40,000/day

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000/day

Translation: ""Pam and Fred went to the carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred rode it four times. Afterwards, they each rode the lodge twice. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?""

Answer: 
Pam rode the roller coaster twice, which is 2 x 6 = 12 tickets. 
Fred rode the roller coaster four times, which is 4 x 6 = 24 tickets. 
They each rode the lodge twice, which is 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for each of them. 
So, Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets. 
Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets. 
In total, they used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets."	60

Ukubonga! (Answer!)

Let's calculate: 4 miles (Monday) + 6 miles (Tuesday) = 10 miles. Total miles from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. So, miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 10 = 31 miles.

136	There are only 27 unicorns left in the world, a quarter of them in the Scottish Highlands. Two quarters of Scottish unicorns are feral. How many female Scottish unicorns are there?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A quarter of 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 4 = 6.75, but we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, so let's say 7 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.
* Two quarters of the Scottish unicorns are feral, so that's 2 × 7 ÷ 4 = 3.5, but again, we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, so let's say 3 feral unicorns.
* Now, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide any information about the gender of the unicorns. So, we can't give an exact answer. But if we assume an equal number of male and female unicorns, we could say there are approximately 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 female Scottish unicorns, but that's just an estimate.

138	Mark took a test last night consisting of 75 mice. He completed the test at an average of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another 100 questions at an average of 1. If he had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unfinished?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Last night, Mark had 75 questions and completed them at 5 questions per hour. To find out how many hours it took him, we divide 75 by 5, which gives us 15 hours. But he only had 8 hours, so he didn't finish all of them. To find out how many he didn't finish, we subtract 8 from 15, which gives us 7 hours. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, we multiply 7 by 5, which gives us 35 questions left unfinished.

Today, Mark had 100 questions and completed them at 1 question per hour. He had 6 hours, so he completed 6 questions. To find out how many he didn't finish, we subtract 6 from 100, which gives us 94 questions left unfinished.

In total, Mark left 35 + 94 = 129 questions unfinished.

140	There are 20 cars available for rental, 12 cars are automatic, 4 are semi-automatic and the rest are semi-automatic. What is the average percentage of semi-automatic cars?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 12 cars are automatic
* 4 cars are semi-automatic
* The rest are manual, so 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are manual

Since there are 4 semi-automatic cars and 4 manual cars, the total number of semi-automatic cars is 4 + 4 = 8.

To find the average percentage, multiply the total number of semi-automatic cars by 100 and divide by the total number of cars:

(8 x 100) / 20 = 40%

So, the average percentage of semi-automatic cars is 40%.

141	There are 700 bees in the cave. There are twice as many worker bees as queen bees, and there are twice as many queen bees as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* There are twice as many queen bees as drone bees, so if we let drone bees be x, then queen bees are 2x.
* There are twice as many worker bees as queen bees, so worker bees are 2(2x) = 4x.
* The total number of bees is 700, so we set up the equation: x + 2x + 4x = 700.
* Combining like terms, we get 7x = 700.
* Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 100.
* So, worker bees are 4x = 4(100) = 400.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 400 worker bees.

144	Kim has started her own business as a housekeeper and calculates the profit she will make from her clients. She already has three clients, but she is talking to 5 other potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in her calculations. Each client's household will need 2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning cloths. The detergent bottles will cost $2 each and the pack of cleaning cloths will cost $5 each. These are her costs. Calculate her total weekly salary to be $92. The profit is only the difference between the total salary and the total costs, so what is the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make per week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Kim has 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients, so she expects to have 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of detergent and 1 pack of cleaning cloths. The total cost of detergent per client is 2 x $2 = $4, and the total cost of cleaning cloths per client is $5. So, the total cost per client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, her total weekly cost is 8 x $9 = $72.

Her total weekly salary is $92, so her profit per week is $92 - $72 = $20.

The profit per dollar is the profit divided by the total weekly salary, which is $20 ÷ $92 = 0.217 (or approximately 21.7%).

So, Kim's profit per week, per dollar, is 21.7%.

(Understanding that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. It is said that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, which is 4 times a year.)

Ngakho John angakhetha amapayini akhe ayi-10 * 100 = 1000 amapayini ngosuku olulodwa. Ngakho ngamazinga ayi-4, John angakhetha amapayini akhe ayi-1000 * 4 = 4000 amapayini ngonyaka.

(Therefore, John can harvest 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples every 3 months. Therefore, in 4 times a year, John can harvest 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples a year.)

* The second box has three times as many pieces as the 500 pieces, so that's 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.
* The third box has a quarter of the number of pieces in the first box, so that's 500 ÷ 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.

She sees twice as many bees as the ones she first saw flying out of the cave and the ones leaving in 3 hours. So all the bees that had previously left would not have returned to the cave in the next 6 hours. How many bees have you seen returning to the cave in the last 6 hours?	75	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the cave.
In the next 6 hours, half as many bees returned, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.

In the next 3 hours, twice as many bees flew out as the ones that left initially (30) and the ones that returned (15). So, 2 x (30 + 15) = 2 x 45 = 90 bees flew out.

Since all the bees that left initially didn't return in the next 6 hours, the bees that returned in the last 6 hours are the ones that flew out in the next 3 hours, which is 90.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees returned to the cave.

Charlie has 3 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends.

150	Steve and Tim decide to see who will be the fastest to get from school to home. Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles away from school and pedals 440 times a minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school. If Tim can skate 264 times a minute, how long will the winner wait at his home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, let's calculate how long it takes Steve to get home:

Distance = 3 miles
Pedals per minute = 440
Assuming each pedal covers a certain distance, let's call it x.
Then, total distance = total pedals × x
3 miles = 440 × x
x = 3/440 = 0.00682 miles per pedal

Now, let's find out how many pedals Steve needs to cover 3 miles:
Total pedals = Total distance ÷ x
= 3 ÷ 0.00682
= 440 pedals (since he pedals 440 times a minute)

Time taken by Steve = Total pedals ÷ Pedals per minute
= 440 ÷ 440
= 1 minute

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Tim to get home:

Distance = 2 miles
Skates per minute = 264
Assuming each skate covers a certain distance, let's call it y.
Then, total distance = total skates × y
2 miles = 264 × y
y = 2/264 = 0.00758 miles per skate

Now, let's find out how many skates Tim needs to cover 2 miles:
Total skates = Total distance ÷ y
= 2 ÷ 0.00758
= 264 skates (since he skates 264 times a minute)

Time taken by Tim = Total skates ÷ Skates per minute
= 264 ÷ 264
= 1 minute

Since both Steve and Tim take 1 minute to reach their homes, they will reach at the same time. Therefore, the winner will not have to wait at all!

151	Shaunda decides that the kids in the neighborhood can all use the bike-climbing service. She decides that the best way to give a price is a tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to air. On the first day, 5 people on a bike came to air both tires. 3 people came to air their Tricycles. Finally, one person came on a one-wheel bike. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 people with bikes came to air both tires, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents, so that's 10 x 25 = 250 cents.
* 3 people with tricycles came to air their tires, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents, so that's 9 x 25 = 225 cents.
* 1 person with a one-wheel bike came to air their tire, so that's 1 x 1 = 1 tire. Each tire costs 25 cents, so that's 1 x 25 = 25 cents.

Adding it all up, Shaunda made 250 + 225 + 25 = 500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, Shaunda made 500 / 100 = 5 dollars that day!

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will get: $10 - $0.60 = $9.40.

Ukuthula, Carl gets $9.40 as change! (That's ""peace"" in Zulu, meaning ""you're welcome""!)"	9
153	Dave bought french fries and ate fourteen of them before the hungry sea otter ate the bag in his hand. When the sea otter came he quickly ate half the amount of french fries Dave had eaten. He was then removed from eating three of the penguins, and each penguin ate three french fries, then the raccoon stole a quarter of the remaining french fries. The ants carried off the last french fries, leaving the Five behind. How many french fries were in the package that Dave had bought?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The sea otter ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
3. The sea otter was removed from eating 3 penguins, and each penguin ate 3 french fries, so 3 x 3 = 9 french fries were eaten by the penguins.
4. The raccoon stole a quarter of the remaining french fries. Let's call the total number of french fries x. The raccoon stole x / 4 french fries.
5. The ants carried off the last french fries, leaving 5 behind.

Let's set up an equation:

x - 14 (Dave's share) - 7 (sea otter's share) - 9 (penguins' share) - x/4 (raccoon's share) = 5

Simplifying the equation:

x - 30 - x/4 = 5

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

4x - 120 - x = 20

Combining like terms:

3x - 120 = 20

Adding 120 to both sides:

3x = 140

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 46.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a french fry, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 47

So, Dave bought 47 french fries.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, college student Kimo has three classes a day. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two-hour classes a day. In one semester there are 16 school weeks. In the other semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes a day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 classes per week.

Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes a day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 classes per week.

In total, Kimo has 9 + 4 = 13 classes per week.

In one semester, there are 16 school weeks, so Kimo attends 13 x 16 = 208 classes in one semester.

Since each class is 1 hour, Kimo spends 208 hours attending classes in one semester.

In the other semester, it's the same, so Kimo spends 208 hours attending classes.

155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 bagels every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each bagel is one foot long. If Bill puts all the baked treats from the beginning to the end, how long will it take him to prepare them?	280	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total length of the baked treats:

300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
60 bagels x 12 inches/bagel (1 foot = 12 inches) = 720 inches

Total length = 1200 + 720 + 720 = 2640 inches

Now, let's convert the total length to feet:
2640 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 220 feet

156	A zoo keeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the bananas on a city farm every 2 months. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and monkeys need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas do they need to order to last 2 months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monkeys need 200 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

Gorillas need 400 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

Chimpanzees need 100 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

In total, they need 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas to last 2 months.

157	Blake and Kelly have a competition to see who can run the fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a 10-yard long football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running on the 40-yard line and back. She does it 43 times. How much faster does the winner run than the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the distance each of them ran:

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 10-yard field, so he covers a distance of:
15 x 2 x 10 = 300 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once on the 10-yard field, then 43 times on the 40-yard field, so she covers a distance of:
1 x 2 x 10 = 20 yards (on the 10-yard field)
43 x 2 x 40 = 3440 yards (on the 40-yard field)
Total distance Kelly ran = 20 + 3440 = 3460 yards

Since Kelly ran a longer distance, she is the winner. To find out how much faster she ran, we can subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:
3460 - 300 = 3160 yards

So, Kelly ran 3160 yards more than Blake.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""U-Kelly uyaphenduka ngamazinga angu-3160!"" (Kelly ran 3160 yards more!)"	3160

Let's break it down:

On Monday, the tank is 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it's 17 + 17 = 34 feet deep.
On Wednesday, it's two-thirds of 34, which is:
34 × (2/3) = 22.67 feet deep.

So, the water is approximately 22.67 feet deep on the third day.

Let's break it down:

Anakin caught 6 seahorses.
Locsin caught at least 3 more seahorses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 + 3 = 9 seahorses.

In total, they claimed to have caught 6 + 9 = 15 seahorses.

162	If a bag of potatoes costs $20 and the price goes up 20% from the average price every two months, how much would a bag of potatoes cost in 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial price = $20
Increase = 20% every 2 months

To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the increase for 18 periods (36 months ÷ 2 months = 18).

Price after 1 period = $20 × (1 + 0.20) = $24
Price after 2 periods = $24 × (1 + 0.20) = $28.80
Price after 3 periods = $28.80 × (1 + 0.20) = $34.56
...
Price after 18 periods = $20 × (1 + 0.20) ^ 18 ≈ $103.95

So, in 36 months, a bag of potatoes would cost approximately $103.95.

Kulungile! (That's okay!)"	103

166	Sandra's neighbor gives her a bucket of 9 eggs for every time she takes care of their daughter. To make a Spanish pastry requires 3 eggs If she was given the job of making 15 Spanish pastry to raise school fees, how many times should the child take care of it?	5	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kungani ukuthola amaqiniso?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

For each Spanish pastry, Sandra needs 3 eggs. To make 15 pastries, she'll need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she takes care of their daughter. To find out how many times she needs to take care of the daughter, we'll divide the total eggs needed (45) by the eggs given each time (9):

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra needs to take care of the daughter 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish pastries.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kumele ukuthola intombazane ngokuhamba kwesikhathi sesihlanu."" (She must take care of the child five times.)"	15

169	Pancho walks 20 miles a day. Excluding weekends he walks 10 miles. How many miles does he walk a week?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks:

20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles. So, he walks:

10 miles × 2 days = 20 miles

In total, Pancho walks:

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

In Zulu, I'll break it down for you:

* Igudu (hat) = $25
* Ishati (shirt) = 3 x $25 = $75

Let's count those legs, Jake!

80 spiders with 8 legs each = 80 x 8 = 640 legs
90 insects with 6 legs each = 90 x 6 = 540 legs
1 reptile with 10 legs = 1 x 10 = 10 legs

Let's break it down:

Sally Twenty-Two is 8 years old.
Sally is the same age as Sally Twenty-Two, so Sally is also 8 years old.
Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Ne, and Sally Ne is the same as Sally, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
Sally II is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally II is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages:
Sally Twenty-Two: 8
Sally: 8
Granny Red: 16
Sally II: 19

Total age: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

173	Her student loan is at least $300, her credit card is at least $200, and her mortgage is at least $500. If Jessica wants to pay at least 50 percent of the mortgage, how much does she pay per year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jessica wants to pay at least 50% of her mortgage, which is at least $500. To find 50% of $500, we can multiply by 0.5:

$500 x 0.5 = $250

Since she wants to pay this amount per year, we can multiply by 12 (months):

$250 x 12 = $3,000

So, Jessica pays at least $3,000 per year.

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 gallon = $3 (lemon) + $2 (sugar) = $5
They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each, so revenue per gallon = 20 x $0.50 = $10
Profit per gallon = $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5
They make a profit of $25, so number of gallons = $25 (profit) / $5 (profit per gallon) = 5 gallons
Total cost = 5 gallons x $5 (cost per gallon) = $25

If Zaid earns $6000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending with a donor?	350	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
3. Total spent so far = $1500 + $2000 = $3500
4. Remaining amount = $6000 - $3500 = $2500
5. Donated to charity: 1/2 of $2500 = $1250
6. Remaining amount after donation = $2500 - $1250 = $1250
7. Given to daughter: $200
8. Given to wife: $700
9. Total given to family = $200 + $700 = $900
10. Remaining amount after family expenses = $1250 - $900 = $350

So, Zaid will have $350 left after spending and donating.

Bo has 40 sharks.
Rani has 4 sharks less than Bo, so Rani has 40 - 4 = 36 sharks.
Monic has 10 sharks less than Rani, so Monic has 36 - 10 = 26 sharks.

Let's break it down: if the winner receives 3/4 of the votes, that means the winner gets 3 parts out of 4 parts. To find the total number of parts, we multiply 80 by 4/4, which gives us 80.

Now, let's find the number of votes for the winner: 3/4 × 80 = 60 votes.

To find the number of votes for the loser, we subtract the winner's votes from the total: 80 - 60 = 20 votes.

So, the loser gets 20 votes.

Let's assume the number of white roses is x. Then, the number of red roses is also x. The number of pink roses is 5x.

In total, Fred needs to send x + x + 5x = 7x roses.

Since Sandra wants Fred to send the roses at 5 o'clock, we need to find the total number of roses. Let's say x = 10. Then, the total number of roses is 7x = 7(10) = 70.

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan. If Jan is currently 30, then two years ago, Jan was 28. So, Mark was 28 + 5.5 = 33.5 years old two years ago. That means Mark is currently 35.5 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 35.5 + 2 = 37.5 years old.

183	Two track teams compete in a 400-meter relay; a race in which each team has four members who run the 400 meters, or one lap, on a standard track. One of the teams is circled by 100 and the members will run the 400 meters on foot in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is not circled well; their runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds so each runner will be 3 seconds faster than the runner before them. Using this information, how many seconds will the team run?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The first runner runs in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Adding up the times, the team will run in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Ukushintsha ukubonga kwesigaxa sesithupha, ukuthi kubalulekile ukuthi uma ungaqhuba isibalo esikhulu kunesigaxa, kubalulekile ukuthi ingaba yini?""

Translation: ""If you rotate the decimal axis by 6, what would it be like if you rotate a number greater than this?""

Now, let's calculate! If Jerry rotates the decimal axis by 6, that means he's moving the decimal point 6 places to the right. To express this as a percentage, we can calculate the multiplier: 10^6 = 1,000,000.

So, if you rotate a number greater than this, let's say by x places, the multiplier would be 10^x. To find the percentage, you can use the formula: (10^x - 1) × 100%.

For example, if x = 7, the multiplier would be 10^7 = 10,000,000, and the percentage would be (10,000,000 - 1) × 100% ≈ 9,999,900%.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kubalulekile ukuthi uma ungaqhuba isibalo esikhulu kunesigaxa sesithupha, ingaba yini ukuthi isiphetho singaba yi-9,999,900%!""

185	Jenna and her mother picked apples from their farm, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. If the mother got apples, how many apples did they both pick?	30	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's say the mother picked ""x"" apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, Jenna picked x/2 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples picked by the mother and Jenna:

x + x/2 =?

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x = 3x

So, they both picked 3x apples.

188	A trader buys bags of quality wheat for $20 a bag. If it costs $2 to transport it from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at an average cost of 30 percent each, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Let x be the number of bags sold.

The cost price per bag = $20 + $2 (transportation cost) = $22

The selling price per bag = $22 + (30% of $22) = $22 + $6.60 = $28.60

Total revenue = $28.60x

Total cost = $22x

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $400

$28.60x - $22x = $400

$6.60x = $400

x = $400 / $6.60
x = 60.61 ≈ 61

189	Three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They spent $4.50 on cash and on food that was cheaper than tickets. They also went on a trip that cost $33 each. If they agreed to split all the expenses equally, how much would each of them pay?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the expenses:

* Tickets: $20.25
* Cash and food: $4.50
* Trip: $33 each, so total is $33 x 3 = $99
* Total expenses: $20.25 + $4.50 + $99 = $123.75

Since they agreed to split the expenses equally, each friend will pay:
$123.75 ÷ 3 = $41.25

190	John collects peaches for 3 hours.He can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute.How many peaches does he collect?	360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so John collects peaches for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute, so in 180 minutes, he can collect 2 x 180 = 360 peaches.

191	A three-pound duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

10 ducks need 10 x 3.5 = 35 pounds of insects per week.

To find out how many pounds they need per day, we divide by 7:

35 pounds ÷ 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day.

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die. How many trees does he leave?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he plants 10 x 10 = 100 trees.

He cuts down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he cuts down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.

He starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.

So, Tom is left with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	91
193	Sue lives in a funny neighborhood. One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue. On Friday morning they put 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.

Let's calculate the change Violetta will get.

She needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2, so the total cost of the crayons is:

5 x $2 = $10

195	A pencil is as expensive as a pencil and a pencil eraser combined. A pencil costs $12 and a pencil eraser $0.30. How much will 8 pencils cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. A pencil costs $12, and a pencil eraser costs $0.30. Since a pencil is as expensive as a pencil and a pencil eraser combined, we can set up the equation:

Pencil = Pencil + Pencil Eraser
$12 = $12 + $0.30

Now, let's find the cost of 8 pencils:

8 Pencils = 8 x $12 = $96

So, 8 pencils will cost $96.

197	In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. They include 8417 men and 9092 women. The remaining population is made up of children. How many children in Soda?	6277	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total inhabitants = 23786
Men = 8417
Women = 9092
Total adults = Men + Women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, let's subtract the total adults from the total inhabitants to get the number of children:

Children = Total inhabitants - Total adults = 23786 - 17509 = 6277

198	At the end of the month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected at least 20 more cards than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined. How many cards does she now have in total?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

In the first month, she collected x cards.
In the second month, she collected at least 20 more cards, so she collected x + 20 cards.
In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined, which is 2(x + x + 20) = 2(2x + 20) = 4x + 40 cards.

The total number of cards she has is x + (x + 20) + (4x + 40) = 6x + 60.

Since we know she collected three times the number of cards in the first month, x = 3x, so x = 10.

The total number of cards she has is 6(10) + 60 = 120.

In isiZulu, we say: ""Uyaphinda izicathamo zonke izi-120."" (She now has a total of 120 cards.)"	120
199	Mark is an editor. He edits the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, with one paying him a different price per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as publisher A. Mark edits 1,000 sentences each week, and publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.	7500	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mark edits 1,000 sentences per week for both publishers.
Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns:
1,000 sentences/week × 5 cents/sentence = $50/week from Publisher A

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Mark earns:
$50/week × 2 = $100/week from Publisher B

So, Mark earns a total of $50/week + $100/week = $150/week.

In isiZulu, that's: ""Mark uyaphumelela $150 ngeweki."" (Mark earns $150 per week.)"	150

Let's calculate John's earnings for the year:

1. Lump sum: $5000
2. Current weekly salary: $2000

4. 5% increase in salary: $104,000 × 0.05 = $5,200
5. New annual salary: $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200
6. Total earnings for the year: $109,200 + $5,000 (lump sum) = $114,200

So, John earns $114,200 that year.

204	Janet had 22 green pennies and 10 yellow pennies. So she bought 6 bags of blue pennies and 2 bags of red pennies. There were 9 pennies in each bag of blue pennies and 6 pennies in each bag of red pennies. How many pennies does Janet have?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count Janet's pennies:

Janet had 22 green pennies and 10 yellow pennies, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pennies initially.

She bought 6 bags of blue pennies with 9 pennies in each bag, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pennies.

She also bought 2 bags of red pennies with 6 pennies in each bag, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pennies.

Now, let's add all the pennies together: 32 (initial pennies) + 54 (blue pennies) + 12 (red pennies) = 98 pennies.

Janet has 98 pennies in total!

205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's mathematics class. Mr. Bert gives 6 tests/tests in each semester. He allows students to subtract smaller scores from the average in each semester. If Brinley has a score of 89 71,92,100 and a score of 86 in his first 5 tests, how many scores does he need in the 6th test to get an average of 93?	98	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total score Brinley needs to get an average of 93:

Average = Total score / Number of tests
93 = Total score / 6

To find the total score, multiply both sides by 6:
Total score = 93 x 6
Total score = 558

Now, let's add up Brinley's scores from the first 5 tests:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

To find the score Brinley needs on the 6th test, subtract the total score he already has from the total score he needs:
Score needed = Total score - Total score so far
Score needed = 558 - 438
Score needed = 120

So, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the 6th test to get an average of 93.

Let's solve for the cost of the can of 20 cups:

Let x be the cost of the can of 20 cups.

x = 6,000 - 1,200
x = 4,800

So, the cost of the can of 20 cups is $4,800.

211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so let's assume there are x white chickens. Then, the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5x.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and there are two fewer red chickens than white chickens. So, the number of red chickens is x - 2. The total number of eggs from red chickens is 3(x - 2).

Now, let's set up the equation: 5x + 3(x - 2) = 42.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 5x + 3x - 6 = 42. Combining like terms, we get: 8x - 6 = 42. Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 8x = 48. Dividing both sides by 8, we get: x = 6.

So, there are 6 white chickens. Since there are two fewer red chickens, there are 6 - 2 = 4 red chickens.

Now, let's calculate: The perimeter of the park is 2(l + w) = 2(1.5 + 6) = 2(7.5) = 15 miles. If Gary walks 3 miles per hour, he'll spend 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours walking."	5

Let's break it down: If Sloane counted 50 more customers on Thursday than on Wednesday, that means Wednesday's count plus 50 equals Thursday's count. We know Thursday's count is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

Wednesday's count + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

Wednesday's count = 450

Sloane counted 450 customers on Wednesday!

Now, let's calculate: Janet borrowed $2,000 and offered to pay it back with an interest rate of 10%. The interest would be $2,000 x 0.10 = $200. So, the total amount Janet needs to pay back is $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, she would have paid a total of $165 x 12 = $1,980. To find out how much money Janet would have left over, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

So, Janet would still owe $220. She wouldn't have any money left over, but rather still needs to pay $220 to settle the debt. Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the opportunity to help!"	220

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

The average of their ages in three years is:

224	Carlos and Benji are at sea. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana raft boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for the rent combined?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total rent:

Carlos rents a canoe for $30/hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he pays:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana raft boat for $18/hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Combined, they pay:
$90 + $90 = $180

Let's break it down:

By bus, it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester.
By car, it takes half as many days, which is 6 ÷ 2 = 3 days.

To travel to Rochester by bus and back to New Jersey by car, it will take:
6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

226	James counts his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage () of the newly selected card that will be the type of water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, James had:
30 types of fire
20 types of grass
40 types of water

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 types of water, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 types of water left

He buys 14 types of grass, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 types of grass

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The percentage of water cards is:
(32 / 96) x 100% ≈ 33.33%

So, the percentage of the newly selected card that will be the type of water is approximately 33.33%.

He has a $5.00 gift card he used to go out. How much did he pay for school?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's lunch:

Basic brito: $6.50
Extra meat: $1.00
Cheese: $1.00
Onions: $1.00

Total so far: $6.50 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $10.00
Chips and drinks: $3.00
Total cost: $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00
He used a $5.00 gift card, so he paid: $13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

229	The watermelon farm produced watermelon shoots. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that an average of 30 percent of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so he took them home. When he returned after two weeks, three-quarters of the watermelons were ready, so he harvested them. How many watermelons were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

After 2 months, 30% of the watermelons were ready, so 70% were not ready.

After 2 weeks, 3/4 (or 75%) of the watermelons were ready, so 25% were not ready.

Since 70% were not ready after 2 months, and 25% were not ready after 2 weeks, it means 70% - 45% (since 75% were ready, 25% were not) = 25% of the watermelons were not ready for harvest after 2 weeks.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question. Let's break it down.

On Monday, Robert collects 20 fish. Kyle collects 5 more, so Kyle collects 20 + 5 = 25 fish.

Let's count the penguins:

36 penguins initially
A quarter (1/4) of 36 = 9 penguins go in the water

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

USteve uyathenga ukudla amatamato, futhi uyathenga ukuzithenga amatamato acheche. Uyadla kabili kunezinhlobo zakhe. Uyadla amathamato asixhenxe ngosuku.

(Steve decides to eat tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day.)

(To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can divide the number of tomatoes he eats per day by the number of tomatoes one vine produces per week.)

Amatamato asixhenxe ngosuku = 6
Amatamato amatatu ngoviki = 3

Ukuthenga amatamato acheche akwenzelwe ngomthombo wesigcino, uSteve uyadinga amatamato asixhenxe ngosuku, okuthiwa amatamato ayisithupha ngosuku. Ukuthenga amatamato acheche akwenzelwe ngomthombo wesigcino, omunye umthombo wesigcino ungaphuma amatamato amatatu ngoviki.

Let's break it down, my friend. John wants each of his 20 friends to get 4 slices. That's a total of 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices each, John needs to order 80 ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas.

236	Ram uses many pens. He finds that he can save money by mixing ink from empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs out, how many pens does he get in total?	31	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, let's calculate!)

Ram buys 25 pens initially. When the ink runs out, he mixes the ink to make new pens. Let's assume each empty pen has some ink left, and he can make 1 full pen from the mixed ink of 4 empty pens (this is just an assumption, as the problem doesn't specify the exact ratio).

After using the 25 pens, he'll have 25 empty pens. From these, he can make 25 ÷ 4 = 6.25 full pens (let's round down to 6, since we can't make a fraction of a pen).

So, Ram gets 25 (initial pens) + 6 (new pens) = 31 pens in total.

Jessa is 20 years old.
Mary is 5 years older than Jessa, so Mary is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Joan is 2 years older than Mary, so Joan is 25 + 2 = 27 years old.

Now, let's add their ages:

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 1000 students.

30% of 1000 students left using exit A, which is:
1000 x 0.3 = 300 students

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining students left using exit B, which is:
700 x 3/5 = 420 students

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students

All the remaining 280 students left using exit C.

So, the number of students who left using exit C is 280.

John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many as Robert. So, Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

242	Mike had correspondence with 5 people. He stopped corresponding with 2 of them. Each person sends 2 letters of 5 pages a week. He answers the same way. He can write 1 page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week.	3	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mike corresponds with 5 people initially, but stops corresponding with 2, so he's left with 3 people.

Each person sends 2 letters of 5 pages a week, so Mike receives 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages a week.

He answers the same way, so he writes 30 pages a week.

Since he can write 1 page in 6 minutes, he spends 30 x 6 = 180 minutes writing a week.

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60: 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

Let's calculate Jason's minutes:

He has 1000 minutes every month.
He uses 15 minutes every day to call his boss.
This month has 30 days, so he uses 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.

To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the used minutes from the total:

244	Ginger gave Griffin a full handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin three fewer than the number of fries Kyle had taken. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give to Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Let G = number of fries Ginger gave Griffin
Let K = number of fries Kyle took
Let C = number of fries Colby took

We know C = K - 3 (Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle)

Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so:
G - C = 27

Substitute C = K - 3:
G - (K - 3) = 27
G - K + 3 = 27

Now, let's say K = x (number of fries Kyle took)
G - x + 3 = 27
G - x = 24
G = x + 24

We don't know x, but we know G = x + 24. That means Ginger gave Griffin 24 more fries than Kyle took.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ginger ukubonga kakhulu Griffin amafazi angu-27, futhi uColby waqatha amafazi angu-K-3. Uma uGriffin wahamba nge-27 amafazi, uGinger wayibonga ngani amafazi uGriffin?""

245	There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums. If the aquariums have the same number of alligators in them, how many alligators are in each aquarium?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kune-alligator eziyi-4 kumzobo wokugcina, kune-alligator eziyi-32 kumzobo wokugcina. Ukudlula kwalezi ngqo kwi-alligator kukuphakama kwesifishane sesi-fish esibili kumzobo.

(I'll translate for clarity: There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums.)

Let's find the difference between the number of alligators: 32 - 4 = 28

Since the difference is twice the number of fish, the number of fish is: 28 ÷ 2 = 14

Now, let's assume x is the number of alligators in each aquarium. The total number of alligators is: x + x = 2x

We know the total number of alligators is 36 (4 + 32). So, 2x = 36. Divide both sides by 2: x = 18

Kuphela! (That's it!) There are 18 alligators in each aquarium."	18

After the movie is finished the repairman gives Jean a 10 percent discount for the average amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The repairman costs $250 an hour. He works 6 hours a day, so that's $250 x 6 = $1500 a day.

He works for 7 days a week, so that's $1500 x 7 = $10,500 a week.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so that's $10,500 x 5 = $52,500.

Now, the repairman gives Jean a 10% discount. 10% of $52,500 is $5,250. So, Jean pays $52,500 - $5,250 = $47,250.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 13 = 33 cookies.

Total cookies Sue's sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
