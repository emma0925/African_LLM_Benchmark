2	Josh decided to try home improvement. He bought a house for $80,000 and renovated it for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial cost = $80,000 (house) + $50,000 (renovation) = $130,000

Increased value = 150% of $130,000 = 1.5 x $130,000 = $195,000

Profit = $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"	65000
3	James decided to run 3 marathons 3 times a week. He ran 60 meters in each marathon. How many total meters does he run per week?	540	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngiyabonga ukubuza (Thank you for asking). Let's calculate James' total meters per week.

James runs 3 marathons, 3 times a week. That's a total of 3 x 3 = 9 marathons per week.

In each marathon, he runs 60 meters. So, he runs a total of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.

Ngithola ukuthi uJames uyaphenduka izimoto ezintathu ngeweek, futhi uyaphenduka izintathu ngosuku olunezimoto. Ngakho, uyaphenduka amamitha angu-540 ngeweek.

(That means James runs 540 meters per week.)"	540
4	Every day, Wendi gives each of his chickens three bowls of chicken food, with fruits, nuts and vegetables to keep them safe. He gives the chickens their chicken food three different times. In the morning, he gives his flock 15 bowls of chicken food. In the afternoon, he gives the chickens another 25 bowls of chicken food. How many bowls of chicken food does he need to give his chickens their last meal if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Wendi gives each chicken 3 bowls of food, 3 times a day. So, in total, each chicken needs 3 x 3 = 9 bowls of food.

He has 20 chickens, so he needs 20 x 9 = 180 bowls of food in total.

He already gave 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon, so he's given 15 + 25 = 40 bowls so far.

To find out how many more bowls he needs, we subtract 40 from 180: 180 - 40 = 140.

So, Wendi needs to give his chickens 140 bowls of chicken food for their last meal.

5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all the other glasses are 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does she need to tell them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi Kylar ufuna ukuthenga iziglas 16. (I understand that Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.)

Igglas eliyodwa ili-$5. (One glass costs $5.)

Ama-glas amaningi ayaliphansi ngokushesha kwe-60% kwe-$5. (The other glasses are 60% cheaper than $5.)

$5 * 0.6 = $3. (60% of $5 is $3.)

Kylar ufuna ukuthenga igglas eliyi-$3, 15. (Kylar wants to buy 15 glasses at $3 each.)

$3 * 15 = $45. (15 glasses at $3 each is $45.)

Kylar ufuna ukuthenga igglas eliyodwa ili-$5. (Kylar wants to buy one glass at $5.)

$45 + $5 = $50. (Total cost is $45 + $5.)

Kylar kufuneka akhulume ngomali we-$50. (Kylar needs to tell them $50.)

6	Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle. How many suburbs do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have in total when Seattle has 20 suburbs?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 suburbs.
Charleston has four times as many suburbs as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 suburbs.
Toulouse has twice as many suburbs as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 suburbs.

In total, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 suburbs.

7	Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can actually download 2 GB/second, but 40% of the time, Windows is forced to restart to update, which takes about 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the file from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, let's calculate how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/second = 100 seconds

Now, let's consider the interruptions. Carla loses 20 minutes (or 1200 seconds) every time Windows restarts. Since this happens 40% of the time, we can calculate the total time lost:

100 seconds (initial download time) × 0.4 (40% of the time) = 40 seconds lost per attempt

Since Carla has to restart from scratch, we need to add the lost time to the initial download time:

100 seconds + 40 seconds = 140 seconds

To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to divide the total time by the number of successful attempts. Let's assume Carla needs to attempt the download multiple times until she succeeds:

Total time = 140 seconds × number of attempts

Since Carla loses 40 seconds every time, we can set up an equation:

140 seconds × number of attempts = 200 GB ÷ 2 GB/second

Solving for the number of attempts, we get:

Number of attempts = 200 GB ÷ (2 GB/second × 100 seconds) = 2.86 (round up to 3, since you can't attempt a fraction of a download)

Now, let's calculate the total time:

Total time = 140 seconds × 3 attempts = 420 seconds

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

Total time = 420 seconds ÷ 60 = 7 minutes

Sawubona, my friend! It will take Carla approximately 7 minutes to download the file."	7
8	John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph and then turned around because he realized that he had forgotten something important about home. He tried to get home at 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours waiting and getting close. He then spent the next half hour driving at 30 mph, only to find that he drove the rest of the 4 hours at 80 mph. How far was he from home at the end of the 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he turned around and spent 2 hours waiting and getting close, so he didn't cover any distance during this time.

Next, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Now, he's 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from his starting point (home).

Finally, he drove for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

So, he's now 165 - 120 = 45 miles away from home.

9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She also charged overtime 1.2 times her regular rate. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she make this week?	460	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Eliza worked 40 hours at $10/hour, so she earned:
40 hours x $10/hour = $400

She also worked 5 hours of overtime (45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours) at 1.2 times her regular rate:
5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

10	A startup has 60 subscribers in the first month. The number of subscribers in the second month is three times higher than the number of subscribers in the first month, but it also decreases by 30% in the third month. How many subscribers does the program have in total over the three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

 Month 1: 60 subscribers
 Month 2: 3 times higher than Month 1 = 3 x 60 = 180 subscribers
 Month 3: 180 decreases by 30% = 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 subscribers

Total subscribers over 3 months = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 subscribers

12	Carlos grows mango trees. The tree will cost him $90 to plant. Each year he will grow 7 mango trees, which he can sell for $1.5 each. He spends about $3 a year watering and feeding the trees. How many years will it take before he starts making money on the mango tree?	13	"Ndi Igbo! O di kwa ya. (That's Igbo, let's do it!)

Let's break it down:

Initial investment: $90 (cost of planting the tree)

Annual income: 7 trees × $1.5/tree = $10.5

Annual expense: $3 (watering and feeding)

Net annual income: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it'll take to break even, we'll divide the initial investment by the net annual income:

$90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years

So, it'll take Carlos 12 years before he starts making money on the mango tree.

13	Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold one-third of her candy to the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of the rest to the orange house. If Melanie's candy was 5, how much did she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Melanie sold 1/3 of her candy to the green house. If she started with x candies, she sold x/3 candies.

Then, she sold 2 more to the red house. So, she sold x/3 + 2 candies in total.

Now, she has x - (x/3 + 2) candies left.

She sold half of the rest to the orange house, which is (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 candies.

We know Melanie had 5 candies left after selling to all the houses. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 candies.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	18
14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in modern dance, 25% of the rest enrolled in jazz dance, while the rest enrolled in tap dance. What is the percentage of all students enrolled in tap dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 students enrolled in modern dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.

That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students enrolled in tap dance.

To find the percentage, divide the number of students enrolled in tap dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12 ÷ 20) x 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the students enrolled in tap dance.

15	A trader wants to choose between two options: a watch worth $5,000 or a commodity worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the watch market will rise by 2.5% while the commodity market will rise by 1.2% during the same month. If the trader wants to make a large profit at the end of this month by making a selection, what is the profit?	125	"""Oluwa ni omo to ri iru, iru to ri omo. Iru watch yi o ni idi 2.5%, iru commodity yi o ni idi 1.2%. Iru to ri omo ni idi 8,000, iru yi o ni idi 8,000 x 1.2% = 96. Iru watch yi o ni idi 5,000, iru yi o ni idi 5,000 x 2.5% = 125.

18	Claire made 3 scrambled eggs every morning for breakfast. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the eggs, my friend!

Claire eats 3 eggs every morning, which means she eats 3 eggs per day.

In 1 week, she eats 3 eggs/day × 7 days = 21 eggs.

In 4 weeks, she eats 21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Now, let's convert eggs to dozens: 84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks!

19	Marisa was hiking up a hill for 12 miles. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wanted to reach her goal of 4 miles per hour, how much time (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Marisa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, which is a rate of 4 miles per hour.
She walked 2 miles in 1 hour, which is a rate of 2 miles per hour.

To reach her goal of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles.

To find the time, we can divide the distance by the rate: 6 miles ÷ 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours.

So, Marisa needs 1.5 hours to walk the remaining distance at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

20	I have 10 gallons of pineapple juice which is two thirds water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But as I pour it, I leave one gallon of pineapple juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 gallons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, you have 10 gallons of pineapple juice that is 2/3 water. So, the amount of water in it is:
10 x (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 gallons (approximately)

Now, you pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice that is 3/5 water. So, the amount of water in it is:
15 x (3/5) = 9 gallons

As you pour, you leave 1 gallon behind, so the total amount of pineapple juice now is:
10 + 15 - 1 = 24 gallons

The total amount of water is the sum of the water in both:
6.67 + 9 = 15.67 gallons (approximately)

So, there are approximately 15.67 gallons of water left in the remaining 24 gallons of pineapple juice.

21	Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 years old now.
Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.
Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we need to find the difference between his current age and the age when he had his son: 37 - 23 = 14 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umbewu kaRaymond wazalwa iminyaka engu-14 edlule."" (Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.)"	14
22	Billy sells DVDs. He had 8 customers on Victory Day. His first 3 customers bought one DVD each. His previous 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each. His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is a 25% discount over the original price. What was the original price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem. If the discount is 25%, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Let's call the original price ""x"".

$19.50 = 0.75x

To find the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 ÷ 0.75
x = $26.00

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

3 pairs of socks = 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
3 pairs of shoes = 3 x $42 = $126

Total amount = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothes he bought.

Let's break it down:

Henry stopped after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. That means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

So, he walked between 20 miles and 45 miles. That's a distance of 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

29	Gloria was shopping for shoes when she came across a pair of taco boots that fit her pocket. But she had to choose between the taco boots and two high-heeled shoes that cost a total of $5 less than the taco boots. If one high-heeled shoe was $33 and the other was twice as much, how many dollars for the taco boots?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One high-heeled shoe is $33, and the other is twice as much, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two high-heeled shoes is $33 + $66 = $99.

The taco boots cost $5 more than the high-heeled shoes, so $99 + $5 = $104.

30	If their current combined age is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If their current combined age is 162, and we know Allen is 15 years older than his brother, we can set up an equation.

Let Allen's current age be A and his brother's current age be B. We know A = B + 15.

We also know A + B = 162. Substituting A = B + 15, we get:

B + 15 + B = 162
Combine like terms:
2B + 15 = 162
Subtract 15 from both sides:
2B = 147
Divide by 2:
B = 73.5 (but age can't be a fraction, so we'll round down to 73)

Now, find Allen's current age:
A = B + 15
A = 73 + 15
A = 88

Ten years from now, Allen's age will be:
A + 10 = 88 + 10
A = 98

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 98.

Siyabonga (thank you) for the question, my friend!"	98
31	Gunter is trying to count the beans in a bottle. He asks his friends how much they think will be in the bottle. One says 80. Another says it's 20 more than half of the original. A third says it's 25% more than the original. What is their estimate?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says it's 20 more than half of the original. If we call the original number ""x"", half of it is x/2. 20 more than that is x/2 + 20.
3. The third friend says it's 25% more than the original. 25% of x is 0.25x, so 25% more than x is x + 0.25x.

So, their estimates are:

1. 80
2. x/2 + 20
3. x + 0.25x

33	Gretchen has 110 gold coins. 30 more gold coins than copper coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem in Zulu, one of the official languages of South Africa.

Gretchen una-mali angu-110. Una-mali angu-30 akune-mali angu-copper. Unaningi na-mali angu-Gretchen?

(Gretchen has 110 gold coins. She has 30 more gold coins than copper coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?)

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points, which means he scored 4 + (25% of 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry used to eat 2 yoghurts a day. They are now selling 4 yoghurts for $5.00. How much does yogurt cost in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yoghurts a day, so in 30 days, Terry will eat 2 x 30 = 60 yoghurts.

Since 4 yoghurts cost $5.00, 1 yoghurt costs $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

So, 60 yoghurts will cost 60 x $1.25 = $75.00.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	75
37	John plans to sell his toys and use his money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. Later he buys 8 video games for $20 each and $5. How many Lego sets does he have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

John had 13 Lego sets and sold them all, so he has zero Lego sets left.

38	John ran 60 miles a week. He ran 3 days a week. He ran for 3 and a half hours on the first day than the other two days. How fast was he running?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help you!)

Let's break it down:

John ran 60 miles a week, and he ran 3 days a week. To find out how many miles he ran per day, we can divide 60 miles by 3 days:

60 miles ÷ 3 days = 20 miles per day

He ran for 3 and a half hours on the first day, which is 3.5 hours. Since he ran the same distance on the other two days, we can assume he ran for the same amount of time on those days as well.

To find his speed, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Speed = 20 miles ÷ 3.5 hours

Speed ≈ 5.71 miles per hour

So, John was running at approximately 5.71 miles per hour.

Sawubona! (Goodbye!)"	5
39	Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?	18	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, so if she can walk at x miles per hour, she can run at 2x miles per hour.
2. She can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run, so she can jump at 2x/2 = x miles per hour.
3. She can fly at 3 miles per hour, but this isn't relevant to the walking and running speeds.
4. She wants to spend one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. Let's say she walks for 2t hours and runs for t hours. Then, 2t + t = 6 hours, so t = 2 hours.
5. She walks for 2t = 4 hours, and she walks at x miles per hour, so she walks a total distance of 4x miles.
6. We know she can run at 2x miles per hour, and she runs for t = 2 hours, so she runs a total distance of 2(2x) = 4x miles.
7. Since she walks and runs the same distance, we can set up the equation 4x = 4x, which is true for any value of x.

However, we can't find a specific value for x without more information. If we knew her running or walking speed, we could find the other speed and then the distance she walks. But with the given information, we can't determine a specific answer.

40	Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is twice older than Suzy's iPhone. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon's iPhone?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
Ben's iPhone is twice older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."	8
41	The giant dragon, Perg, sits atop Mount Farbo, spewing fire at anything within 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the golden staff, the only tool known to kill the dragon, from a height of 400 feet, if it is in the dragon's fire ring. But when Polly carries the jewel, she can throw the staff three times farther than if she does not carry the jewel. If she carries the jewel, how far away from the ring must Polly be and how far away from the dragon will the dragon be?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Polly kufanele abe ngaphandle kwesicelo ngaphakathi kwesigcawu sesithupha, kanti u-Perg uzoba ngaphakathi kwesicelo.""

In English, that means: ""Polly must be outside the fire ring, and Perg will be inside the fire ring.""

If Polly carries the jewel, she can throw the staff three times farther, which means she can throw it from a height of 400 x 3 = 1,200 feet.

So, Polly must be 1,200 feet away from the fire ring, and the dragon will be 1,000 feet away from her."	1000
42	Grandma Jones made 5 apple pies for the firemen's lunch. She cut each pie into 8 slices and placed five pies on the dining table for the guests to serve themselves. By the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their own pies, she broke the remaining 14 pies.	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi (I understand that) Grandma Jones made 5 apple pies, and each pie had 8 slices. That's a total of 5 x 8 = 40 slices.

43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips contains 250 calories in one serving. If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend.

One serving has 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide 300g by 5:

300g ÷ 5 = 60g per serving

Now, you've already eaten 1800 calories, and your daily goal is 2000 calories. That means you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

To find out how many grams you can eat, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories ÷ 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since one serving is 60g, you can eat:

0.8 servings × 60g per serving = 48g

So, my friend, you can eat 48g of chips to reach your daily calorie goal.

44	Charlie wants to sell a honeycomb. For every pound of gold in a honeycomb, he can get 10 small honeycombs. A pound of honey and honeycomb is $10.00 each. If he sells each honeycomb for $2.00, what is the total profit if he makes and sells 20 honeycombs?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. For every pound of gold in a honeycomb, Charlie gets 10 small honeycombs.
2. A pound of honey and honeycomb costs $10.00 each.
3. Charlie sells each honeycomb for $2.00.

To find the profit, let's first calculate the cost of producing 20 honeycombs:

Cost = 20 honeycombs / 10 honeycombs per pound × $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the revenue:

Revenue = 20 honeycombs × $2.00 per honeycomb = $40.00

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

So, the total profit is $20.00.

45	Meredith is an accountant who writes about health records and gives them to clients every day as part of her job. An online record takes at least 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 records on Friday and an additional 2/5 records on Victory Day than on Business Day. In April, she doubled the number of records she wrote on Victory Day.	104	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola imibuzo yakho! (I'm happy to answer your questions!)

Let's break it down:

* On Friday, Meredith wrote 5 records.
* On Victory Day, she wrote 2/5 more records than on Business Day. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 × 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 records on Victory Day.
* In April, she doubled the number of records she wrote on Victory Day, so she wrote 2 × 7 = 14 records.

So, the total number of records Meredith wrote is 5 (on Friday) + 7 (on Victory Day) + 14 (in April) = 26 records.

Since each online record takes at least 4 hours to research and write, Meredith spent a minimum of 26 × 4 = 104 hours on writing records.

46	Candice put 80 postcards in her purse before leaving for work at the coffee shop. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought postcards; at work, she put one postcard on each of 220 different cups of coffee. If there were 23 postcards left in total, how many postcards were in the stamps she bought?	163	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Candice had 80 postcards initially.
She put 1 postcard on each of 220 cups, so she used 220 postcards.
She had 23 postcards left.

To find out how many postcards she bought, let's set up an equation:

Initial postcards + Postcards bought = Total postcards used + Postcards left
80 + x = 220 + 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 163

So, Candice bought 163 postcards at the store!

47	John bought twice as many red teas as the green tea. The red tea was 50% more expensive than the green tea. He spent $200 on the green tea which was $40 each. How much did he spend on the tea?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spent $200 on green tea, and each green tea costs $40, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 green teas

Since he bought twice as many red teas, he bought:

5 x 2 = 10 red teas

The red tea is 50% more expensive than the green tea, so it costs:

$40 x 1.5 = $60 per red tea

He spent on red tea:

10 x $60 = $600

In total, John spent:

$200 + $600 = $800

on the tea.

Translation: ""How many floors does Richard's building have? It has 15 floors. Each block of 8, 3/4 of the building is occupied. What is the total number of unoccupied blocks?""

Let's calculate:
15 floors / 8 blocks per floor = 1.875 blocks per floor (since 15 is not divisible by 8, we'll round down to 1 block per floor)
3/4 of 15 = 11.25 (occupied blocks)
Total blocks = 15 / 8 = 1.875 blocks per floor * 15 floors = 28.125 blocks
Unoccupied blocks = Total blocks - Occupied blocks = 28.125 - 11.25 = 16.875 blocks
Since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll round down to 16 unoccupied blocks.

Let's break it down:

Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. At 10 miles per hour, he covered a distance of:

3 hours x 10 miles/hour = 30 miles

Now, he traveled back at 6 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour

Time = 5 hours

So, it took Tom 5 hours to get back.

52	Uriah's briefcase was too heavy for him. He needed to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books each weighed 1/4 of a pound while each toy weighed 1/2 of a pound. If he removed 30 comic books, how many toys did he need to remove?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Uriah removed 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound, so he removed a total of:

30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

from his briefcase. He needed to remove 15 pounds in total, so he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove:

7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15 toys

53	For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic would charge $60 and for each car tire repaired, the mechanic would charge $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 cars. On Sunday, the mechanic repaired 12 truck tires and no truck tires. How much money did the mechanic lose that day?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount of money the mechanic earned on Thursday:

6 truck tires x $60 = $360
4 car tires x $40 = $160
Total = $360 + $160 = $520

On Sunday, the mechanic repaired 12 truck tires and no car tires:
12 truck tires x $60 = $720

The mechanic earned $720 on Sunday, but should have earned $520 (like on Thursday). So, the mechanic lost:
$720 - $520 = $200

Now, let's calculate Marcy's annual pension:

After 20 years, Marcy is entitled to a 5% annual pension. 5% of $50,000 is $2,500.
Since she worked for 30 years, her pension will be proportional to the number of years she worked. 
So, her annual pension will be: ($2,500 / 20) * 30 = $3,750.

U-Marci iphenso layo ngonyaka iyini $3,750! (Marcy's annual pension will be $3,750!)"	3750
63	Aleena paid a monthly fee of $140 for an e-wallet service. If the e-wallet company received the first payment for the first half of the year with a 10% discount for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount paid to the e-wallet company at the end of the year.	1596	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140/month, so the total is:
6 months × $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), there's a 10% discount, so the new monthly fee is:
$140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126/month

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid:
6 months × $126/month = $756

Now, let's add the total amounts for both halves of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1,596

So, the total amount paid to the e-wallet company at the end of the year is $1,596.

She had traveled 100 miles since she last filled her car with gasoline and needed to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline. Her husband's driver's license says her tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophia travel with one tank of gasoline?	300	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

65	Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and decides to go to bed and read for half the time. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and half the time reading, which is 2/2 = 1 hour reading. So, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, making it a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

66	Four schools have competed in a handball tournament. Each school has sent a women's handball team and a men's handball team, each with 5 goalkeepers. Each school has also sent a coach to their team. In total, how many people have all the schools sent?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 4 schools
* Each school has 2 teams (women's and men's)
* Each team has 5 goalkeepers
* Each school has 1 coach

That's 4 schools x 2 teams/school = 8 teams
8 teams x 5 goalkeepers/team = 40 goalkeepers
4 schools x 1 coach/school = 4 coaches

Adding them up: 40 goalkeepers + 4 coaches = 44 people

67	A treasure hunter finds a hidden treasure chest filled with precious stones. 175 diamonds, 35 rubies less than a diamond and twice as much as an emerald. How much treasure is in the box?	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 35 less than diamonds, so 175 - 35 = 140 rubies
* Emeralds: Half the number of rubies, so 140 ÷ 2 = 70 emeralds

Adding them up: 175 + 140 + 70 = 385

Kubonga! (Congratulations!) There are 385 precious stones in the treasure chest!"	385

69	Bailey started with a certain amount of money. He then received $5 a week in food for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if he had a total of $100, how much money did Bailey have to start with?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi uma Bailey enze imali engu-$100 emva kweminyaka eyi-8, futhi wayethola imali engu-$5 ngewezi ngewezi, uma esuke wathola imali engu-$40 ngemali yokudla. Okwamanje, uma esuke wathola imali engu-$100, kufanele abe ngumali engu-$60 kuqala. (I'll help you figure out that if Bailey had $100 after 8 weeks, and he received $5 a week, that's $40 in food money. So, if he had $100, he must have had $60 to start with.)

Imali yokudla: $5/week × 8 weeks = $40

70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes a day, midweek and 8th grade on Wednesdays. If each class has 15 students and she earns $15.00 per child, how much does she make in a week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Judy teaches 5 classes a day, from Monday to Friday (midweek). That's 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes.

On Wednesdays, she teaches 8th grade, which is an additional class. So, she teaches 25 classes + 1 class = 26 classes in a week.

Each class has 15 students, and she earns $15.00 per child. So, her weekly earnings are:

26 classes × 15 students/class × $15.00/student = $5,850.00

73	Sheila bought five telephones at $150 each for a 3-month subscription. There will be 2% interest on each unit. How much will Sheila pay each month for 3 months?	255	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

5 telephones x $150 each = $750
Interest rate: 2% = 0.02
Interest per unit: $150 x 0.02 = $3
Total interest: $3 x 5 = $15
Total amount: $750 + $15 = $765
Monthly payment for 3 months: $765 ÷ 3 = $255

74	Artie has a flower stand at the Farmer's Market. He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, pendants, and begonias. He usually sells a marigold for $2.74 a pot, a pendants for $1.87 a pot, and a begonias for $2.12 a pot. Artie doesn't have a chain today, so he's decided to increase his total price to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 marigolds, 9 pendants, and 17 begonias, what would he have?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Artie would have:

Marigolds: 12 x $2.74 = $32.88 ≈ $33
Pendants: 9 x $1.87 = $16.83 ≈ $17
Begonias: 17 x $2.12 = $36.04 ≈ $36

Total amount: $33 + $17 + $36 = $86

Artie would have $86."	86

77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry if Sarah does 400.	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 units of laundry.

David does 1/4 of Sarah's laundry, so David does 400 ÷ 4 = 100 units.

Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 ÷ 2 = 200 units.

The difference between Raymond's and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 units.

78	Vincent could buy a bouquet of 3 for $2.50 or a bouquet of 2 for $1. How much did he save by buying 18 flowers at a good price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at each price:

**Option 1: 3 flowers for $2.50**
To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 ÷ 3 = 6 bouquets.
Cost = 6 bouquets × $2.50 = $15.00

**Option 2: 2 flowers for $1**
To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 ÷ 2 = 9 bouquets.
Cost = 9 bouquets × $1 = $9.00

By buying at the cheaper price, Vincent saves:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Let's break it down:

Grace weighs 125 pounds.
Alex is 2 pounds shorter than 4 times Grace's weight.
4 times Grace's weight is 4 x 125 = 500 pounds.

87	A company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salary of each of its employees by 10% of the first salary per year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years in the company last October, what is her salary per year after spending three more years on the job?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial salary: $600/month = $7,200/year

After 5 years, Sylvie gets a 10% increase: $7,200 x 0.10 = $720
New salary: $7,200 + $720 = $7,920/year

This increase happens every year, so after 3 more years:

Year 1: $7,920 x 1.10 = $8,712
Year 2: $8,712 x 1.10 = $9,583.20
Year 3: $9,583.20 x 1.10 = $10,541.52

So, after 3 more years, Sylvie's salary per year will be approximately $10,541.52.

Let's break it down, my friend. If Marilyn's album sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, that means if Harald sold x copies, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know the total number of copies sold is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

89	Christina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest she invited, because 1/4 of the guests didn't show up. She invited 16 friends. The gift bags are $2 each. How much will it cost?	24	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 didn't show up. To find 1/4 of 16, we multiply 16 by 0.25, which gives us 4. So, 4 friends didn't show up. That means 16 - 4 = 12 friends attended.

She needs 75 gift bags for each of the 12 friends, so she needs 12 x 75 = 900 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is 900 x $2 = $1800.

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izitho zokudla ze-adult zingama-10 pounds. (Adults eat 10 pounds of salad bar.)

Kune-20 izitho ze-adult, kune-5 izitho ze-baby. (There are 20 adults and 5 babies.)

Ukucula izitho ze-adult: 20 x 10 = 200 pounds. (Total for adults: 20 x 10 = 200 pounds.)
Ukucula izitho ze-baby: 5 x 5 = 25 pounds. (Total for babies: 5 x 5 = 25 pounds.)

Let's break it down:

* James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
* Amy is 5 years younger than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 + 5 = 14 years old.

So, Jackson is 14 years old.

Let's break it down:

* There are 2 cats and 1 dog, so there are 2 + 1 = 3 dogs and cats.
* There are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 3 - 12 = 9 fewer rabbits.
* Since there are 60 dogs, and we already counted 1 dog, there are 60 - 1 = 59 more dogs.
* Now, let's add up all the animals: 2 cats + 1 dog + 59 dogs + (3 - 12) rabbits = 2 + 1 + 59 + 9 = 71 animals.

Kutheni, kukhona amanani ayi-71 emphakathini! (Therefore, there are 71 animals in the community!)"	71
95	Out of 200 fifth graders, two-fifths are male while two-thirds are female in scouts, how many women are not in scouts?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two-fifths of 200 are male, so the number of males is:
2/5 × 200 = 80

Two-thirds of 200 are female in scouts, so the number of females in scouts is:
2/3 × 200 = 133.33 ≈ 133 (since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of females is:
200 - 80 = 120

The number of females not in scouts is:
120 - 133 = -13 (wait, that can't be right!)

Let me recheck... Ah, I see the mistake!

The correct calculation is:
The number of females not in scouts is:
120 - 120 = 0 (since 133 is more than the total number of females)

So, the answer is: Akukho omuntu (There is no one) or 0 females who are not in scouts."	0

If there are 30 cars on the road, how many cars can pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* A few cars entered in the first 15 minutes (unknown number)
* 20 more cars entered in the last 15 minutes
* 5 cars left the line to enter the traffic jam
* There are 30 cars on the road

Let's assume the unknown number of cars that entered in the first 15 minutes is x.

We know that x + 20 (cars that entered in the last 15 minutes) - 5 (cars that left the line) = 30 (total cars on the road)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 30

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 15

So, 15 cars can pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

But wait, she's not giving away all 20, just 1! So, she'll be left with 20 - 1 = 19 potted plants.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!

Answer: Mary will have 19 potted plants left."	19
100	Jerome had 4 friends who visited him in a day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first Jerome's friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. if the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so that's 20 + (20/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell rang: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The doorbell rang 175 times."	175
101	Solo had to read page 4 of his science book, page 20 of the Book of Socrates, page 7 of the Book of Esther and page 8 of the Book of Geography. Solo read page 15 on business days. If he had 4 more days to read all his books, how many pages would he have to read in half a day?	6	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Hello, hello!)

Let's break it down:

Solo needs to read:
- Page 4 of his science book
- Page 20 of the Book of Socrates
- Page 7 of the Book of Esther
- Page 8 of the Book of Geography

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

He reads 15 pages on business days, so in 4 days, he'll read:
15 x 4 = 60 pages

But he only needs to read 39 pages. To find out how many pages he'll read in half a day, let's first find out how many pages he'll read in 1 day:
60 ÷ 4 = 15 pages per day

Now, in half a day, he'll read:
15 ÷ 2 = 7.5 pages

So, Solo would have to read 7.5 pages in half a day.

102	John likes to drink a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he drinks one before going to bed at the same time. John does this every day during the week, but on weekends he likes to relax and have a soft drink with dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink per week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifunda ukuthi John udla amaglasi angu-4 asemanti ngosuku, futhi wayedla amaglasi angu-3 kusasa ngolwesihlanu. Kepha, ngolwesihlanu, wayedla isoftidrinki ngokuhlala, ayidla iglasi lesimanti. Ngakho, ngifunda ukuthi John udla amaglasi angu-26 asemanti ngobusuku. (I found that John drinks 4 glasses of water per day, and 3 glasses on weekends. But on weekends, he drinks a soft drink instead, so he drinks 26 glasses of water per week.)

103	Clouds rise from the sea to cover the entire city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across the sea to the other side of the country, how many minutes would it take for the cloud to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. The cloud covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1 mile, we divide 10 minutes by 3 miles, which gives us 10/3 = 3.33 minutes per mile.

Now, the city is 42 miles across. To find out how many minutes it takes to cover the entire city, we multiply the distance by the time per mile: 42 miles × 3.33 minutes/mile = 140 minutes.

So, it would take the cloud 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	140
104	Poppy is editing 1000 puzzles. She puts half of them on the board, her mother puts the other third. How many puzzles are left?	500	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy puts half of 1000 puzzles on the board, which is 1000 ÷ 2 = 500 puzzles.

Her mother puts a third of the remaining puzzles, which is 1000 - 500 = 500 ÷ 3 = 166.67 (let's round it down to 166 puzzles).

Now, let's add the puzzles Poppy and her mother put up: 500 + 166 = 666 puzzles.

To find the number of puzzles left, subtract the total puzzles they put up from the original 1000: 1000 - 666 = 334 puzzles.

So, there are 334 puzzles left! Ngiyajabula ukuthola ibhinca! (I'm happy to have found the answer!)"	334
105	Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do they both eat in total?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, so if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.

In total, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box has 5 to 6 to 4 corners. The wall has 1 corner. What is the total size of the three boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukuba John una amakhokhi amathathu. Amakhokhi amaningi ane-corners eyi-5, eyi-6, eyi-4. Umuzi unecorner eyi-1. Inani lengqondo yamakhokhi amathathu?""

Now, let's calculate the total size of the three boxes:

Box 1: 5 corners
Box 2: 6 corners
Box 3: 4 corners
Total corners: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 corners

The wall has 1 corner, but we're not counting that.

So, the total size of the three boxes is 15 corners. In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Inani lengqondo yamakhokhi amathathu yi-15."""	15
107	Frankie watches TV in the evening after doing his homework. He watches his favorite one-hour show on business and victory days. On Sundays he watches a half-hour show. On Wednesdays, he finishes his homework early to watch a one-and-a-half-hour game. On Fridays he sleeps late because it's a weekend, so he watches a two-hour game. If he watches TV for 7 hours straight, how many half-hour games does he watch a day?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Frankie's TV watching habits:

* One-hour show on business and victory days (assuming 2 days) = 2 hours
* Half-hour show on Sundays = 0.5 hours
* One-and-a-half-hour game on Wednesdays = 1.5 hours
* Two-hour game on Fridays = 2 hours

Total hours watched per week = 2 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Since Frankie watches TV for 7 hours straight, he watches an additional 1 hour.

To find out how many half-hour games he watches a day, we can convert the additional hour to half-hour games:

1 hour = 2 half-hour games

So, Frankie watches 2 half-hour games a day.

108	Henry is making cookies for a home competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. At the end of the party he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than he wanted to. He dropped 5 while waiting for it to cool, now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let x be the number of cookies Henry made last year.

He wants to make twice as many, so he wants to make 2x cookies.

But he ends up making 15 more than he wanted, so he makes 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5, he has 110 cookies left, so 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So Henry made 50 cookies last year.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	50
109	The local gas station sells gas at $3.00 per gallon. The internet company wants to buy $20 per gallon if you buy gas at this store. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much gas will they have after this opportunity?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price: $3.00 per gallon
Discounted price: $20 per gallon (if you buy at this store)
Amount of gas bought: 10 gallons

Original cost: 10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Discount: $30.00 - $20.00 = $10.00
New cost: $30.00 - $10.00 = $20.00

So, the person will pay $20.00 for 10 gallons of gas. They will still have 10 gallons of gas, but they'll save $10.00!

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uyabonga ukuthenga igazi elinganiselwa ku-$20.00, ufuna igazi elinganiselwa ku-10!"" (You're lucky to buy gas at $20.00, you'll get 10 gallons of gas!)"	10
110	Marcell and Beatrice were competing to see who could eat the most fruit rolls, they released as many as they could find. But someone made a mistake which made Beatrice's roll up 3 inches and 24 inches long while Marcell's roll up 3 inches and 14 inches long. If they both ate all the rolls they were given, how many did they eat in half?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inketho. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Icala likaBeatrice liyindlela 24 inches, ikakhulukazi 3 inches. Icala likaMarcell liyindlela 14 inches, ikakhulukazi 3 inches.

Ukuba besebenzisa amanani, sizokubona ukuthi i-Beatrice ithole 24/2 = 12 inches, ikakhulukazi 3 inches. I-Marcell ithole 14/2 = 7 inches, ikakhulukazi 3 inches.

Ngakho, besebenzisa amanani, i-Beatrice ithole 12 - 3 = 9 inches, ikakhulukazi. I-Marcell ithole 7 - 3 = 4 inches, ikakhulukazi.

Kuthola ukuthi baya 9 + 4 = 13 inches, ikakhulukazi. (So, they ate 13 inches in half.)

111	The boat sails while afloat. The boat drinks two liters of water for every foot when it returns to port. It takes about 16 minutes to cross 20 feet. The port is 64 minutes away. How much water has the boat dragged by the time Julia arrives at the port?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The boat takes 16 minutes to cross 20 feet, so its speed is 20 feet / 16 minutes = 1.25 feet per minute.
2. The port is 64 minutes away, so the boat will travel a total distance of 64 minutes x 1.25 feet/minute = 80 feet.
3. For every foot, the boat drinks 2 liters of water. So, it will drink a total of 80 feet x 2 liters/foot = 160 liters of water.

Kushuleka, Julia! (Goodbye, Julia!) The boat will have dragged 160 liters of water by the time Julia arrives at the port."	160
112	A classroom has a whiteboard that is divided among 4 teachers who take turns to use the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is turned off 3 times in each lesson, how many times is the whiteboard turned off during the day?	24	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukubonga ukuthi (Let me calculate that)... 

Ithina lesi (Each teacher) has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers, so ithina lesi (each teacher) will have a total of 2 x 4 = 8 lessons per day.

I-whiteboard iyatholakala (the whiteboard is turned off) 3 times in each lesson, so ithina lesi (each teacher) will turn off the whiteboard 3 x 8 = 24 times per day.

114	Jamal's telescope can take 6 times more pictures than Brittany's telescope. Brittany's telescope can take 50 times more pictures than Jamal's bird in the zoo. If Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures, how many birds can we see in Jamal's bird in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures.
Brittany's telescope can take 1/6 of that, so 1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures.
Jamal's bird in the zoo can take 1/50 of that, so 300 ÷ 50 = 6 pictures.

So, Jamal's bird in the zoo can take 6 pictures, which means we can see 6 birds!

115	Sasha notices that the price of wood has gone up by 50% in the last few months after buying some of the wood. When she has the rest, she plans to sell them. She has an order for ten 2 × 4 × 10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4 × 4 × 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells all of them, how much profit will she make?	90	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the wood Sasha bought:

10 boards of 2 × 4 × 10 = 10 × $10 = $100
5 boards of 4 × 4 × 10 = 5 × $16 = $80
Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the price of wood has gone up by 50%, Sasha can sell each board at 150% of the original price:

10 boards of 2 × 4 × 10 = 10 × $10 × 1.5 = $150
5 boards of 4 × 4 × 10 = 5 × $16 × 1.5 = $120
Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

Now, let's calculate Sasha's profit:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

Sasha will make a profit of $90.

116	Katy brews coffee with a ratio of 7:13 of sugar to a teaspoon of water. Using a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, calculate how much sugar to a teaspoon of water she used.	42	"Ehe, ngiwa kuwe! (Ah, I understand!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Katy uses a ratio of 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 teaspoons of water. We know she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar. To find out how much water she used, we can set up a proportion:

7 teaspoons sugar / 13 teaspoons water = 120 teaspoons sugar / x teaspoons water

Cross-multiply, my friend:

7x = 120 × 13
7x = 1560
x = 1560 ÷ 7
x = 223 teaspoons of water

So, Katy used 223 teaspoons of water. Now, to find out how much sugar she used per teaspoon of water, we can divide the total sugar by the total water:

120 teaspoons sugar ÷ 223 teaspoons water = 0.54 teaspoons sugar per teaspoon of water

Ehe, ngiwa kuwe! (Ah, I understand!) Katy used approximately 0.54 teaspoons of sugar per teaspoon of water."	0

119	Adrien's total salary is 30 percent more than Lylah's. After four years, her salary is the same and she is earning 40% more than she was earning four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries are the same and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate their total salary after four years?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrien's salary is 30% more than Lylah's, so if Lylah's salary is x, Adrien's salary is x + 0.3x = 1.3x.
2. Four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000, so x = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769 (Lylah's salary four years ago).
3. After four years, Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so her new salary is $30,769 + (40% of $30,769) = $30,769 + $12,307 = $43,076.
4. Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries are the same after four years, Adrien's salary is also $43,076.
5. Their total salary after four years is $43,076 + $43,076 = $86,152.

Let's count the fruits:

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought two and a half more fruits than Morisette, so Kael brought 13 + 2.5 = 15.5 fruits. Since we can't bring a fraction of a fruit, we'll round up to 16 fruits.

In total, they brought 13 + 16 = 29 fruits.

Let's break it down:

Sadie slept 8 hours on Friday. That's 8 hours.

For 2 days, she slept less than 2 hours each. That's 2 hours x 2 days = 4 hours.

She slept an hour more than she slept on those 2 days, so that's 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours.

Let's break it down:

* The price of one watermelon is three times the price of one pepper. Let's say the price of one pepper is x. Then, the price of one watermelon is 3x.
* Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 × 3x = 12x.

9% of 60 = 5.4, but since we can't have a fraction of an elf, let's round down to 5 elves shot by children.

Total elves shot = 6 + 5 = 11

Elves left = 60 - 11 = 49

So, 49 elves were left.

In Yoruba, we can say: ""Ọmọ elf 49 ló wà lára!"" (There are 49 elf children left!)"	49

132	Pam and Fred went to a party. Pam rode the roller coaster in pairs, while Fred rode in pairs. In celebration of that, they decided to ride the luge in pairs. If a ride in pairs costs 6 bucks, how many bucks are used that day?	60	"""Sawa sawa! Eeeto emeka abuo, Pam na Fred gara party. Pam jiri roller coaster n'abuo, ebe Fred jiri n'abuo.

133	On Business Day, Walt walked 4 miles. On Labor Day, he walked three and a half miles walking with Business. His total mileage on Business Day to Labor Day was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. On Business Day, Walt walked 4 miles. On Labor Day, he walked 3.5 miles. So, the total miles walked on these two days is 4 + 3.5 = 7.5 miles.

Now, the total mileage from Business Day to Labor Day is 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked, we subtract the miles walked on these two days from the total mileage: 41 - 7.5 = 33.5 miles.

So, Walt walked 33.5 miles, my friend!

Let's break it down:

* One-third of 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 unicorns.
* Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so that's 2/3 × 9 = 6 female unicorns.

Kutheni, kukho amaqhuzu amathathu asixhenxe e-Scottish Highlands! (So, there are six female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands!)"	6
137	Rory bought two socks for $7.50, two bags for $1.50 and two cookies for $1. There is a 20% delivery charge added at the checkout, and she wants to make an extra $5. What is the total cost of the item she just sent?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Socks: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Bags: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
Cookies: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery charge: 20% of $20.00 = $4.00
Total cost with delivery: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add $5.00, so the total cost is: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) The total cost is twenty-nine dollars."	29
138	Mark took yesterday's test with 75 questions. He finished the test with 5 questions in an hour. Today, he took another 100 questions in the same time. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave unanswered?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Yesterday, Mark finished 75 - 5 = 70 questions in 1 hour. So, in 8 hours, he could have finished 70 x 8 = 560 questions. But there were only 75 questions, so he didn't leave any unanswered.

Today, Mark finished 100 questions in 1 hour. So, in 6 hours, he could have finished 100 x 6 = 600 questions. But there were no questions left, so he didn't leave any unanswered.

So, in total, Mark didn't leave any questions unanswered.

If 12 cars are autonomous and 4 are manual, that means 12 + 4 = 16 cars are either autonomous or manual.

Since there are 20 cars in total, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 of the cars are semi-automatic!"	4
141	There are 700 eggs in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives, and twice as many hives as there are queens. How many workers are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* There are 700 eggs in the hive, but we're not concerned with the eggs, so let's move on.
* There are twice as many worker bees as there are hives.
* There are twice as many hives as there are queens.

Let's assume there's 1 queen. Then there are 2 hives (twice as many hives as queens). And there are 4 worker bees (twice as many worker bees as hives).

Now, we know there's only 1 hive with 700 eggs, so we can scale up. If there's 1 hive, there's 1 queen. If there are 2 hives, there's 1 queen. So, the number of queens is 1.

The number of hives is 700 (given). The number of worker bees is twice the number of hives, so it's 2 x 700 = 1400.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) There are 1400 worker bees.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezisebenzi eziyi-1400."" (There are 1400 workers.)"	1400
142	Jordan plays video games for two hours a day. He also has a small job where he makes $10 an hour. How much will Jordan make in a week if he uses his video game time to work?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, and he makes $10 an hour at his job. If he uses his video game time to work, he will work 2 hours a day, 7 days a week. That's 2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours/week.

Since he makes $10 an hour, he will make 14 hours/week x $10/hour = $140/week.

In Zulu, that's ""Izindleko zakhe ziyi-$140 ngeweke!"" (His weekly earnings are $140!)"	140
143	John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, lights for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. If there's a 10% tax on all non-food items, what's the point of everything he buys?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down John's purchases:

Food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total food cost: $2 + $3 = $5

Non-food items:
- Lights: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

10% tax on non-food items: $10 x 0.1 = $1

Total cost including tax: $5 (food) + $10 (non-food) + $1 (tax) = $16

So, the point of everything John buys is $16.

144	Kim has started her own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit she will make from her customers. She already has 3 customers, but she is talking to 5 other customers and has the courage to include them in her account. Each customer's house will need two bottles of bleach and lots of clothes to dispose of. The bottle of bleach will be $2 each, the clothes will be $5 each.	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

145	John has 10 hectares of palm plantation. There are 100 palms on each hectare. John can harvest his palms in three months. How many palms can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's break it down:

John has 10 hectares of palm plantation.
Each hectare has 100 palms, so he has a total of 10 x 100 = 1000 palms.

He can harvest his palms in 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months ÷ 3 months = 4).

So, John can harvest 1000 palms x 4 = 4000 palms in a year!

Odi nma! (That's ""it's good"" in Igbo)"	4000
146	Johnny is collecting toys in his bedroom. He has thrown a box of 500 Lego bricks on the floor, another with three times the number of 500 bricks, and another with a quarter of the number of bricks. How many stalls does Johnny make if he collects all the Lego bricks?	2,125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the Lego bricks:

* 1st box: 500 bricks
* 2nd box: 3 x 500 = 1500 bricks
* 3rd box: 500 / 4 = 125 bricks

Total bricks: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 bricks

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Johnny ukhomba amabrikhi angu-2125!"" (Johnny collects 2125 bricks!)

Now, let's assume Johnny makes stalls with equal numbers of bricks. To find out how many stalls he can make, we can divide the total number of bricks by the number of bricks per stall. Since we don't know the number of bricks per stall, let's assume it's a reasonable number, like 10 bricks per stall.

Number of stalls: 2125 ÷ 10 = 212.5 stalls

Since we can't have a fraction of a stall, Johnny can make approximately 212 stalls.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Johnny ukwakha amastali angu-212!"" (Johnny builds 212 stalls!)"	212
147	Debra was monitoring the bridge to see how many bees were coming and going on a given day. She saw 30 bees leaving the bridge in the first 6 hours, then saw 1/2 the number of bees returning in the next 6 hours. She saw twice as many bees as the first one leaving the hive flying off the bridge and leaving in the next 6 hours. Then all the bees that left before didn't return to the bridge in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see returning to the bridge in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the bridge.
In the next 6 hours, half of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours left the bridge, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.
In the last 6 hours, none of the bees that left earlier returned.

So, the number of bees that returned to the bridge in the last 6 hours is 15.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Ibeesi elilandelayo libuyisana ku-15."" (The bees that returned are 15.)"	15
148	Brittany and her mother went to the museum. Admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gave the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she got $8 in change, how many dollars did she give to the cashier?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 child ticket = $10
1 adult ticket = $12
Total cost = $10 + $12 = $22

If she got $8 in change, that means she gave the cashier:

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

So, Brittany's mother gave the cashier $30.

149	Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many Facebook friends does James have?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ukuthi James unaabangani abayizi-4 kulabo kaDorothy, kuyafana ukuthi unaabangani abayizi-16 baseFacebook.

(Translation: Charlie has 12 Facebook friends. That means he has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has 12 divided by 3, that means she has 4 friends. And if James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, that means he has 16 Facebook friends.)"	16
150	Steve and Tim decided to see who could get home from school the fastest. Steve lived farther away than Tim, so they allowed him to ride his bike. Steve lived three miles from the school and could ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lived two miles from the school. If Tim could skate his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long would the winner be at home before the loser finished the race?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Steve uyaphuma ekuhamba kwesikhathi esingamakhulukhulu (Steve is riding his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute). Ukudla kwesikhathi esingamakhulukhulu kuya kwe-3 amayiles (He needs to cover a distance of 3 miles). 1 amayile = 5280 amafutha (1 mile = 5280 feet), so Steve needs to cover 3 x 5280 = 15840 amafutha.

Ukuthola isikhathi esingakwesaba (To find the time it takes), sisetha ukudla ngokwesikhathi (divide the distance by the speed): 15840 ÷ 440 = 36 amaminithi (36 minutes).

Tim uyaphuma ekuhamba kwesikhathi esingamakhulukhulu (Tim is skating at a speed of 264 feet per minute). Ukudla kwesikhathi esingamakhulukhulu kuya kwe-2 amayiles (He needs to cover a distance of 2 miles). 2 x 5280 = 10560 amafutha.

Ukuthola isikhathi esingakwesaba (To find the time it takes), sisetha ukudla ngokwesikhathi (divide the distance by the speed): 10560 ÷ 264 = 40 amaminithi (40 minutes).

Ukuba Steve uyaphuma ngokushesha (Since Steve finishes first), ukuthola isikhathi esingakwesaba ukuba Tim ufike (to find the time it takes for Tim to finish), sisetha 40 - 36 = 4 amaminithi (4 minutes).

Kusho ukuthi Steve uzoba ngokuqeda ngamaminithi amane (So Steve will be home 4 minutes before Tim finishes)."	4
151	Shawnda decided that her neighborhood needed a tire repair shop. She decided that the best way to charge for each tire would be 25 cents per tire. On the first day, five people on a bike came to ask for two tires. Three people came to ask for all five of their tires. Finally, one person came to her with a bicycle. How many dollars did she lose that day?	5	"Ewe: ""Eyi be wo dɔ wo dɔ wɔ Shawnda yi wɔ. Wɔdɔ wɔ 5 no, wɔde 2 tiɛ ɛnɛ. Wɔdɔ wɔ 3 no, wɔde 5 tiɛ ɛnɛ. Wɔdɔ wɔ 1 no, wɔde 2 tiɛ ɛnɛ.

152	Carl bought ten boxes of cookies. Each box of cookies contained six cookies. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much did Carl get for $10?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

10 boxes x 6 cookies/box = 60 cookies
60 cookies x $0.10/cookie = $6

So, with $10, Carl can buy:
$10 ÷ $6 = 1.67 times
Since we can't buy a fraction of a batch, Carl can buy 1 batch and have $4 left.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuthenga kwakhe kwaba izinkwa ezingama-60, futhi wayenza imali engu-$4."" (He bought 60 cookies and had $4 left.)"	4
153	Dave bought a large packet of french fries, and it took 14 minutes for a hungry shark to steal the packet. When the shark calmed down, it was half the amount of french fries Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons chased him away from the food, and each bird ate three fries. Then a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries.	48	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!) Let me calculate...

Dave had a packet of french fries. A shark stole it and ate half of what Dave had eaten. Let's say Dave ate x fries. Then the shark ate x/2 fries.

Now, Dave had x - x/2 = x/2 fries left. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries. Dave had x/2 - 9 fries left.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's say Dave had y fries left. Then the raccoon stole 2y/3 fries. Dave had y - 2y/3 = y/3 fries left.

We know that y/3 = x/2 - 9. Let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 6 to get 2y = 3x - 54. Divide both sides by 3 to get 2y/3 = x - 18.

Now, substitute y/3 = x/2 - 9 into 2y/3 = x - 18. We get x/2 - 9 = x - 18. Add 9 to both sides to get x/2 = x - 9. Subtract x from both sides to get -x/2 = -9. Multiply both sides by -2 to get x = 18.

So Dave had 18 fries initially. The shark stole the packet and ate 9 fries (half of 18). Dave had 9 fries left. The three pigeons ate 9 fries, leaving Dave with 0 fries. The raccoon stole 0 fries.

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""Dave ti gba ọkọọ fries mẹẹẹdọgbọn, shark ti gbọdọrọ packet na, o si je 9 fries. Dave ti ṣeẹ 9 fries, pigeon mẹẹẹta ate 9 fries, raccoon si gbọdọrọ 0 fries!""

155	Bill cooks 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes a day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to compare the lengths of the products he cooks to each other, how long would they be in feet?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 300 rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches
* 120 croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes x 2 feet = 120 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's convert everything to feet:
* 1200 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 100 feet (rolls)
* 720 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 60 feet (croissants)
* 1440 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 120 feet (baguettes)

So, the lengths would be: rolls - 100 feet, croissants - 60 feet, and baguettes - 120 feet.

Let's break it down:

Monkeys need 100 eggs per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 eggs.
Monkeys need 200 eggs, so in total, they need 200 + 200 = 400 eggs.
Rabbits need 400 eggs.

160	On Victory Day, the tank was filled with 7 feet more water. On Independence Day, the tank was two-thirds as deep as it was on Victory Day. What was the tank's depth on Independence Day?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Victory Day, the tank was filled with 7 feet more water, so the depth on Victory Day is x + 7.

On Independence Day, the tank was two-thirds as deep as it was on Victory Day, so the depth on Independence Day is (2/3)(x + 7).

To find the depth on Independence Day, we can simplify the expression:

(2/3)(x + 7) = (2/3)x + (2/3)(7)
= (2/3)x + 14/3

Since we don't know the original depth x, we can't find the exact depth on Independence Day. However, we can express it as (2/3)x + 14/3.

(6 + 3) seahorses = 9 seahorses
(3 + 2) clownfish = 5 clownfish
Total fish caught by Locsin = 15 + 9 + 5 = 29 fish

162	If a bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price in two months, how much will a bag of marbles be after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Since the price increases by 20% every 2 months, we'll calculate the price for every 2-month period:

After 4 months = $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months = $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 36 months =... (continuing the pattern)
After 36 months = $103.31

163	In one room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, a number 3 kitten, and a doll. The doll is priced at the price of three numbers, and a car is $4. What is the total value of the toys, if a number is $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A doll is priced at the price of three numbers, and a number is $5, so the doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.
* A car is $4, and there are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the cars is 5 x $4 = $20.
* The kitten is just a toy, no price is mentioned, so we can't calculate its value.

Adding the values of the doll and the cars, we get: $15 + $20 = $35.

So, the total value of the toys is $35.

166	Sandra's neighbor gives her nine boxes of eggs every time she helps them look after their daughter. She needs three eggs to make a single Spanish flan.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukubonga kwakhe kwaba yimihlanu."" (Her gratitude was five times.)

Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan, and she needs to make 15 flan. So, she needs 3 x 15 = 45 eggs.
Each time she looks after the child, she gets 9 boxes of eggs. To find out how many times she needs to look after the child, we divide 45 by 9, which gives us 5. Therefore, Sandra needs to look after the child 5 times."	5
167	Seth's age is twice Brooke's age. After two years, their combined age is 28. How old is Seth?	16	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Brooke's age = x
Seth's age = 2x (since Seth's age is twice Brooke's age)

After 2 years, Brooke's age = x + 2
After 2 years, Seth's age = 2x + 2

Their combined age after 2 years = 28
So, (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28
Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24
Divide by 3: x = 8

So, Brooke's age = 8
Seth's age = 2x = 2(8) = 16

172	There are four birds in the Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is eight years old, what is the average age of the four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, so Sally Thirtytwo is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's find the average age:

(8 + 8 + 16 + 19) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

So, the average age of the four birds is 12.75 years old.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they sell it for $3 for lemon and $2 for sugar. They sell each bottle for $0.50, and they get 20 bottles for a gallon. If they get $25 in profit, how much do they spend on lemonade?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for a gallon, so they make $10 per gallon (20 x $0.50).

They spend $3 on lemon and $2 on sugar per gallon, so their total cost per gallon is $5.

Let's say they sell x gallons. Then, their total revenue is $10x, and their total cost is $5x.

Their profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5

So, they sell 5 gallons. Their total cost is $5 x 5 = $25.

If Zaid receives $6,000 a month, what would be the maximum after all these expenses and gifts?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Zaid's salary is $6,000.

He spent 1/4 on rent, which is $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500.
He spent 1/3 on gas, which is $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000.
He donated half of the remaining amount, which is $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500. Half of that is $2,500 x 1/2 = $1,250.

He gave his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so that's $900 in total.

Now, let's subtract all the expenses from his salary:
$6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 - $1,250 - $900 = $900.

So, the maximum amount Zaid has after all these expenses and gifts is $900.

Let's break it down:

The merchant buys each sack for $20 and sells it for $30, so the profit per sack is $30 - $20 = $10. However, it costs $2 to carry each sack, so the net profit per sack is $10 - $2 = $8.

The merchant makes $400 in total, so to find the number of sacks, we divide the total profit by the net profit per sack: $400 ÷ $8 = 50 sacks.

So, the merchant sold 50 sacks of wheat.

Let's break it down:

Tom starts with 50 trees.
Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts 2 trees, so he has a net gain of 8 trees per year.
After 10 years, he would have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut 2 x 10 = 20 trees.
So, he would have 50 (initial trees) + 100 (new trees) - 20 (cut trees) = 130 trees.
30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.
So, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

198	Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she received three times that amount. In the second month, she received 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, she received twice the total number of Pokemon cards she received in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: Elaine had 20 cards and received 3 times that amount, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards. So, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

Month 2: She received 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which means she received 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now, she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

Month 3: She received twice the total number of cards she received in the first and second months. The total cards received in the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that amount is 100 x 2 = 200 cards. Now, she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

So, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards!"	320
199	Mark is a copy-editor. He edits the same amount of sentences for two different editors, who pay him a different amount per sentence. Copywriter B pays twice what Copywriter A paid Mark. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences for him, and A pays him 5 cents per sentence. What does Mark get for a penny, per cent?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark edits 1000 sentences for both copywriters. Copywriter A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns:

1000 sentences × 5 cents = 5000 cents

Copywriter B pays twice as much as Copywriter A, so Mark earns:

5000 cents × 2 = 10,000 cents

Now, to find out what Mark gets for a penny, we need to convert the total cents to dollars:

10,000 cents ÷ 100 = $100

So, Mark gets $100 for a penny, per cent.

(Translation: ""Baldur pumps water in the morning, he pumps 5 buckets. In the morning, he pumps 5 buckets, in the afternoon, he pumps 6 buckets. If a bald eagle has 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does Baldur get per day?"")

Now, let's calculate! Baldur gets 5 buckets in the morning and 6 buckets in the afternoon, so he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 buckets per day. Since a bald eagle has 5 liters of water, we can assume each bucket is 5 liters. Therefore, Baldur gets 11 buckets x 5 liters/bucket = 55 liters of water per day!"	55
201	John received a bonus at work. The bonus included a one-time $5000 bonus and a 5% increase in his salary. If he earned $2000 for the entire year and received the bonus on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

5% increase in salary = 5% of $2000 = $100
New salary for the year = $2000 + $100 = $2100

He did this for four weeks, then decided, to ride the bicycle only twice a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and did this for three weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal walk in total?	860	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Weeks 1-4: Micheal rides 5 times a week, 25 km each time = 5 x 25 = 125 km/week
For 4 weeks, he rides a total of 125 x 4 = 500 km

Weeks 5-7: Micheal rides 2 times a week, 60 km each time = 2 x 60 = 120 km/week
For 3 weeks, he rides a total of 120 x 3 = 360 km

207	A Halloween candy Joe bag contains 25 chocolates and 80 candy apples. Each chocolate bar has twice the amount of candy apples. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, what is the weight of a candy Joe bag in grams?	2600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Each chocolate bar has twice the amount of candy apples, so one chocolate bar is equal to 2 candy apples.

There are 25 chocolates, so that's equivalent to 25 x 2 = 50 candy apples.

Adding the 80 candy apples already in the bag, we have a total of 80 + 50 = 130 candy apples.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of chocolates is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams.

Now, let's assume the weight of one candy apple is x. Then, the total weight of candy apples is 130x.

We don't know the weight of a candy apple, but we can set up an equation:

1000 (weight of chocolates) + 130x (weight of candy apples) = Total weight of the bag

Let's call the total weight of the bag ""y"". Then:

1000 + 130x = y

Unfortunately, we can't find the exact weight of the bag without knowing the weight of a candy apple. But we can express the total weight in terms of x:

y = 1000 + 130x

209	Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than six cans sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the price of each cup	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

6 cans sold for $6,000 each, so the total price is 6 x $6,000 = $36,000.

12 cups sold for $1200 less than that, so the total price is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

To find the price of each cup, we divide the total price by 12: $34,800 ÷ 12 = $2,900 per cup.

210	Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and a pair of shoes. The jacket is about $30, and the shoes are $20 each. Sara cleans the neighborhood four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cleans the field. If Sara had already saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many times did she have to clear the field to buy the jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola izincwadi zakho! (I love solving your math problems!)

Let's break it down:

Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $20 for the shoes, so she needs a total of $30 + $20 = $50.

She earns $5 each time she cleans the neighborhood, and she does it 4 times, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20.

She already had $10 saved, so she has $10 + $20 = $30.

To get the remaining $20, she needs to clean the field. She earns $4 each time she cleans the field, so she needs to clean the field $20 ÷ $4 = 5 times.

So, Sara needs to clear the field 5 times to buy the jacket and shoes.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Sara kufanele acophe izindlu zesifunda ngokubonga 5 ukuthenga ijeketi nelisuka."" (Sara needs to clean the field 5 times to buy the jacket and shoes.)"	5
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Izinhlanzi ezimnyama (red chickens) lay 3 eggs a day.
Izinhlanzi ezimhlophe (white chickens) lay less than 5 eggs a day, so let's say they lay 4 eggs a day.
Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.

Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Then, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up the equation:
3x + 4(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 4x + 8 = 42
7x + 8 = 42
7x = 34
x = 4.86 (but we can't have a fraction of a chicken, so we round down to 4)

Izindlela zokubonga kwepaki ziyi: 1.5 + 6 + 1.5 + 6 = 15 miles. (The perimeter of the park is: 1.5 + 6 + 1.5 + 6 = 15 miles.)

Ukuthi uGary uyaphi ngomzuzu ongama-3, kuyafana ukuthi uyaphi ngamaphakathi amahora angama-5. (Since Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, it means he walks for 5 hours.)

Ngicela ukuthi uGary uyaphi amahora angama-5. (I conclude that Gary walks for 5 hours.)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers on Day 1 and 2: 100 + 150 = 250 customers

If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, and we subtract the customers from the first two days, we get:

500 - 250 = 250 customers

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, both leaking 4 gallons of water per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the volume of the small pool. Now the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?	8	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Let the volume of the small pool 4 minutes ago be x.

The big pool had twice the volume, so it was 2x.

Since both pools leak 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, they would have leaked a total of:

4 gallons/minute × 4 minutes = 16 gallons

So, the small pool would have lost 16 gallons, making its current volume:

x - 16

The big pool would have lost 16 gallons too, making its current volume:

2x - 16

Now, the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Solving for x, we get:

x = 48

So, the small pool had 48 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it leaked 16 gallons, it now has:

48 - 16 = 32 gallons

Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!) The small pool has 32 gallons of water now."	32

Harriet is 21 years old now.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 x 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 x 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, their ages will be:

Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years old
Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years old
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old

Adding up their ages in three years, we get:

226	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water. If he loses 8 of the water types and buys 14 types of grass, what is the 100 percent chance (converted to the nearest number) that the randomly drawn card will be a type of water?	33	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has:

30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

He loses 8 water types, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 water types left

He buys 14 grass types, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass types

The new total number of cards is:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of drawing a water type is:
32 (water) / 96 (total) = 0.333...

 Converted to a percentage, it's approximately:
33%

So, the 100% chance (converted to the nearest number) that the randomly drawn card will be a type of water is 33%."	33
227	Chad bought a homemade burrito for lunch. The simple burrito was $6.50. He made additional meat for $2.00, additional milk for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and two knives for $0.25 each. He decided to make his own food campaign for an additional $3.00 that would include snacks and drinks. He had a gift card for $5.00 that he used to pay for. How much did he eat?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

* Simple burrito: $6.50
* Additional meat: $2.00
* Additional milk: $1.00
* Avocado: $1.00
* Two knives: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
* Food campaign: $3.00
* Total: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

He used a $5.00 gift card, so he paid:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

In Zulu, I'd say: ""U Chad uyaphakama ngama randi ayisithupha!"" (Chad paid nine dollars!)"	9
228	Kalinda is working on a 360 problem with her mother. Kalinda can add four sheets per minute. Your mother can add half as many sheets per minute. How many hours will it take them to complete this problem?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kalinda adds 4 sheets per minute.
Her mother adds half as many sheets per minute, so that's 4 ÷ 2 = 2 sheets per minute.

Together, they add 4 + 2 = 6 sheets per minute.

To find out how many minutes it'll take to complete 360 sheets, we divide 360 by 6:
360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it'll take them 60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour to complete the task.

230	Mark bought 12 cars for his company. Each car cost $20,000. He paid a 10% tax on the cars plus an additional $1000 for the registration of each one. How much did he pay for all of it?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

12 cars x $20,000 each = $240,000 (total cost of cars)

10% tax on $240,000 = $24,000 (tax amount)

$24,000 (tax) + $240,000 (car cost) = $264,000 (total cost so far)

Additional $1000 registration fee for each car = 12 cars x $1000 = $12,000

Total amount Mark paid = $264,000 (total cost so far) + $12,000 (registration fee) = $276,000

234	"Steve decides to eat a lot of tomatoes, and he decides to grow his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend says he eats. He eats ten a day. If a tree produces six tomatoes, how many trees does it need?"""	21	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Okay!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break this down:

Steve eats 10 tomatoes a day, but his girlfriend says he eats twice as much, so he actually eats 10 x 2 = 20 tomatoes a day.

If a tree produces 6 tomatoes, to find out how many trees Steve needs, we'll divide the number of tomatoes he eats per day by the number of tomatoes one tree produces:

20 tomatoes/day ÷ 6 tomatoes/tree = 3.33 trees

So, Steve needs approximately 4 trees to produce enough tomatoes for his daily consumption."	4
235	John bought some pizza to share with his friends. There were 20 of them in total, and John wanted to make sure that you wrote down that there were 10 slices of each. A pizza usually has 10 slices of each. How many pizzas does John need to buy?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthi John kudinga ipi zephepha! (I'm happy to help you with that!)

Let's break it down: John wants 10 slices of pizza for each of his 20 friends. That means he needs a total of 20 x 10 = 200 slices of pizza.

Since each pizza has 10 slices, John will need 200 ÷ 10 = 20 pizzas.

Ngifuna ukuthi ukuthola ukuthi unezinto ezinhlanu ezimbi kuyinto eyodwa. Uma ebutha amapeni ayi-25 asebenzisa ukuthola amaqhuzu amabi, inani labapeni abayothola? (You want to know how many pens he will have if he combines five empty pens into one. If he buys 25 pens and uses them to find the colors of the finished pens, how many pens will he have in total?)

Ukubonga, uma unezinto ezinhlanu ezimbi kuyinto eyodwa, uthola ukuthi inani labapeni alikho kubili. Uma ebutha amapeni ayi-25, uthola ukuthi inani labapeni alikho kubili ku-5. (To answer, if he combines five empty pens into one, he will have two pens left. If he buys 25 pens, he will have two pens left for every 5.)

Inani labapeni alikho kubili ku-5 = 25/5 = 5. Uma uthola ukuthi inani labapeni alikho kubili ku-5, uthola ukuthi inani labapeni alikho kubili = 5 + 5 = 10.

(If two pens are left for every 5, then 25/5 = 5. If he has two pens left for every 5, then he will have 5 + 5 = 10 pens in total.)

Inani labapeni alikho kubili = 10. (The total number of pens is 10.)

Translation: ""Hello! I understand that Joan married Mary in two years, and married Jessa in five years. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the average age of the three women?""

Let's calculate the average age:

Mary's age = 20 - 5 = 15 (since Joan married Jessa 5 years ago, and Jessa is 20 now)
Joan's age = 20 - 5 + 2 = 17 (since Joan married Mary 2 years before marrying Jessa)
Average age = (15 + 17 + 20) / 3 = 52 / 3 = 17.33

""Ngithola ukuthi amanani aphakeme ngamasiko amathathu yi-17.33!""

Let's break it down:

* 30% of 1000 pupils get result A, which is 0.3 x 1000 = 300 pupils
* The remaining pupils are 1000 - 300 = 700 pupils
* 3/5 of the remaining pupils get result B, which is (3/5) x 700 = 420 pupils
* The remaining pupils get result C, which is 700 - 420 = 280 pupils

So, 280 pupils got result C.

Let's break it down:

John has 54 candies.
John has 2 more candies than Robert, so Robert has 54 - 2 = 52 candies.
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 52 + 6 = 58 candies.
John has 54 candies, and James has 58 candies, so John has 58 - 54 = 4 fewer candies than James.

242	Mike is best friends with five people. He stopped being friends with two of them. Each of them sends two letters a week with five pages each. He responds well. He can write one page in six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a book a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mike has 5 friends, but he stopped being friends with 2, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 friends left.

Each of them sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 friends x 2 letters = 6 letters a week.

Each letter has 5 pages, so he receives 6 letters x 5 pages = 30 pages a week.

He responds well, so he writes 30 pages back.

He can write 1 page in 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, it takes him 30 pages x 6 minutes = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

244	Griffin has 24 french fries, but Kyle takes 5 of them. Billy gets twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin some of her french fries, then Colby takes from Griffin, who gets three fewer than Kyle. If Griffin has 27 french fries, how many french fries does Ginger give to Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 left.
Billy got twice as many as Kyle, so Billy got 2 x 5 = 10 french fries.
Now, Griffin had 19 french fries.
Ginger gave some french fries to Griffin, so let's call that x.
Colby took from Griffin, and Colby got 3 fewer than Kyle, so Colby got 5 - 3 = 2 french fries.
Griffin had 19 + x - 2 = 17 + x french fries left.
But we know Griffin had 27 french fries in the end, so we set up the equation:
17 + x = 27
Subtract 17 from both sides:
x = 10

Ginger gave Griffin 10 french fries!

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Ginger ugabe i-French fries ezili-10 ku-Griffin!"" (Ginger gave Griffin 10 French fries!)"	10

246	Jean was paid $250 an hour by a jean artist. She needed a very expensive cut for the film she was in and it took six hours to make every day and it needed to be made four times a week. The film took five weeks to complete. After the film was made the artist gave Jean a 10% discount for the amount of work done. What did Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean needed a cut 4 times a week, for 5 weeks, and each cut took 6 hours. So, the total hours worked = 4 cuts/week × 5 weeks × 6 hours/cut = 120 hours.

The artist charged $250/hour, so the total cost = 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000.

With a 10% discount, Jean paid = $30,000 - (10% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

249	On Business Day, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. On Victory Day, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Business Day and 13 the next day. If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories does Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Business Day, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Victory Day, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories:

Sue ate 46 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Her sister ate 18 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories more than her sister.
