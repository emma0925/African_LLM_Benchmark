What's the dollar amount for a dabia at the farmer's market?	18	"Nzuri sana! (Very good!) Let's calculate the number of eggs Janet sells:

16 eggs laid - 3 eggs eaten = 13 eggs
13 eggs - 4 eggs baked = 9 eggs sold

Janet earns $2 per egg, so she earns:
9 eggs x $2/egg = $18

In Swahili, I'd say: ""Janet anapata pesa kumi na nane kwa siku kwenye soko la mboga."" (Janet earns eighteen dollars a day at the farmer's market.)"	18
1	A rabbit needs two pieces of white bread and half of white bread. How many pieces of white bread does he need?	3	"Ewe: Mía mítɔ́nú awùn lílá wò, míatɔ́nú awùn lílá àbùn, bò míatɔ́nú awùn lílá àtɔ́n. Éyi míatɔ́nú awùn lílá 2.5 wò.

Translation: The rabbit needs two pieces of white bread and half of white bread. That means the rabbit needs 2.5 pieces of white bread."	2
2	Josh plans to buy and sell a house. He buys the house for $80,000 and repairs it for $50,000. This increases the house's value by 150%.	70000	"Odiro ombiro! (That's ""okay"" in Luo, a language spoken in Kenya and Tanzania.)

Let's calculate the value of the house after repairs:

Original price = $80,000
Repair cost = $50,000
Total investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The house's value increases by 150%, so the new value is:
New value = $130,000 x 2.5 (1 + 1.5) = $325,000

So, the house is now worth $325,000."	325000
3	James plans to run 3 times a week. He runs 60 miles per race. How many miles per week does he run?	540	"""Sawa sawa! James atarudia marathoni matatu kwa wiki. Anarukia maili 60 kwa mbio moja. Basi, anarukia maili 60 x 3 = maili 180 kwa wiki."" (That's ""Okay! James runs three times a week. He runs 60 miles per race. So, he runs 60 x 3 = 180 miles per week"" in Swahili.)"	180
4	Every day, Wendi gives her chickens three cups of chicken food, consisting of chickens, elephants and vegetables to give them strength. She gives the food to the chickens three times. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of food, in the afternoon, she gives the chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to give the chickens at the last meal of the day if the total number of Wendi chickens is 20?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of food 3 times a day. So, she gives a total of 3 x 3 = 9 cups of food per meal.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of food, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of food. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of food.

Since she has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 9 cups of food, the total amount of food needed is 20 x 9 = 180 cups.

She's already given 40 cups, so she needs 180 - 40 = 140 cups of food for the last meal.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Wendi kudinga amacupi angu-140 ekudleni lwakhe lwesithathu."" (Wendi needs 140 cups of food for her third meal.)"	140
5	Kylar went to the supermarket to buy a kit for her new house. Each kit cost $5, but each subsequent kit cost 60 percent of the price. Kylar wanted to buy 16 kits. Did she have to pay for all of them?	64	Ewe: Eyi wò, Kylar yè na ɖu ƒe kit 16 wo. Kit ɖeka wò nyɛ $5. Egɔme kit ɖeka wò nyɛ 60% ƒe ƒe kit ɖeka.

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have if they all have 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has x sheep.
Charleston has 4x sheep.
Toulouse has 2(4x) = 8x sheep.

We know they have a total of 20 sheep. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 4x + 8x = 20

Combine like terms:
13x = 20

Divide by 13:
x = 20/13
x = 1.54 (approximately)

So, Seattle has approximately 1.54 sheep (let's assume 2 sheep).
Charleston has 4(2) = 8 sheep.
Toulouse has 2(8) = 16 sheep.

There you have it, ngane! (my friend!)"	16
7	Carla was downloading 200 GB of files from a remote computer. She could have downloaded 2GB per minute, but when she downloaded 40%, Windows restarted to load new files onto the machine, and it took 20 minutes. Carla had to restart the downloading process from the beginning.	160	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Okay, let's break it down!)

Carla dey download 200 GB of files, but she don finish. She download 40%, wey be 80 GB (40% of 200 GB).

After Windows restart, Carla start from scratch. She dey download 2 GB per minute. To download 200 GB, she go take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

But wait, she lose 20 minutes when Windows restart. So, she go take 100 + 20 = 120 minutes to finish download.

Ebi so, Carla go take 120 minutes to download 200 GB of files."	200
8	John rides his camel for 3 hours at 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes that his car is missing something valuable in the house. He plans to return home in 4 hours but spends the first two hours in traffic. He runs the next half hour at 30mph, before spending the rest of the four hours at 80 mph. What is the distance between home and home after these four hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

John rides his camel for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

He turns around and heads back home. He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he runs for half an hour at 30 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he spends the remaining 3.5 hours (4 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 3.5 hours = 280 miles

Since John is heading back home, we subtract the distance he covered on the way back from the distance he covered on the way out:
Total Distance = Distance out - Distance back = 180 miles - (15 miles + 280 miles) = 180 miles - 295 miles = -115 miles

However, distance cannot be negative, so we take the absolute value:
Total Distance = | -115 miles | = 115 miles

So, the distance between home and home after these four hours is 115 miles.

9	Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of work in a week is $10. She also receives 1.2 times the hourly wage. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, what will she get this week?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Ukubonga kwakhe kwesikhathi sesikhathi esingama-40 ngawezi $10. Uyafunda futhi 1.2 times ukubonga kwesikhathi. Uma u-Eliza ewese 45 amahora ngaleli week, ingabe izokuthola kanjani ngaleli week?

(Translation: Her hourly wage for the first 40 hours is $10. She also receives 1.2 times the hourly wage. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she get this week?)

Ukubonga kwakhe kwesikhathi sesikhathi esingama-40 = $10/hour
Ukubonga kwakhe kwesikhathi sesingama-5 = $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour
Izindleko zakhe ngaleli week = (40 hours x $10/hour) + (5 hours x $12/hour)
= $400 + $60
= $460

U-Eliza uzokuthola $460 ngaleli week! (Eliza will get $460 this week!)"	460
10	An app is downloaded from a user's mobile device 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number in the first month, and 30% less in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in all three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Total downloads in three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought several loaves of bread. She bought thirty-two loaves of bread, each worth $68, twenty-four loaves of bread, each worth $80, and ninety-two cheese loaves, each worth $55. What did she make?	694	"Ehe, ndi ofuma! (Ah, let me calculate!)

For 32 loaves of bread at $68 each, Toula spent: 32 x $68 = $2176

For 24 loaves of bread at $80 each, Toula spent: 24 x $80 = $1920

For 92 cheese loaves at $55 each, Toula spent: 92 x $55 = $5060

In total, Toula spent: $2176 + $1920 + $5060 = $9156

Odi nma! (That's a lot of money!)

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""Owo Toula ni $9156!"" (Toula has $9156!)"	9156
12	Carlos is planting a tree. The cost of planting a tree is $90 per year, while planting 7 trees can cost $1.5 each. He spends $3 per year watering the tree. How many years will it take to get the money?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of planting 1 tree per year = $90
Cost of planting 7 trees = $1.5 x 7 = $10.50 per year
Carlos spends $3 per year watering the tree, so total cost per year = $90 + $3 = $93
To find out how many years it'll take to get the money, we'll divide the total cost by the cost of planting 7 trees: $93 ÷ $10.50 = 8.86 years

So, it'll take Carlos approximately 9 years to get the money.

13	Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sells three of her printing presses in the green house, two more in the red house, and the other half in the other house. If Melanie has 5 printing presses left, how can she thank them?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 3 printing presses in the green house.
She sold 2 more in the red house, making it a total of 3 + 2 = 5.
She sold half of the remaining printing presses in the other house.
Let's assume she had x printing presses initially.
She sold 5, and half of the remaining, which means she sold 5 + (x - 5)/2.
We know she has 5 printing presses left, so the equation becomes:
x - (5 + (x - 5)/2) = 5
Solving for x, we get x = 15.

Melanie had 15 printing presses initially.
She can't thank the printing presses, but she can thank the customers who bought them!

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	15
14	In a dance class of 20 students, twenty percent are enrolled in the dance class, the other fifty percent are enrolled in the Jazz class, and the rest are enrolled in the hip-hop class. What percentage are enrolled in the hip-hop class?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% are enrolled in the dance class, which means 20% of 20 students = 4 students.

50% are enrolled in the Jazz class, which means 50% of 20 students = 10 students.

To find the number of students enrolled in the hip-hop class, subtract the number of students in the dance and Jazz classes from the total:

20 (total students) - 4 (dance class) - 10 (Jazz class) = 6 students

Now, to find the percentage:

(6 students / 20 total students) x 100% = 30%

So, 30% of the students are enrolled in the hip-hop class.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!"	30
15	A seller offers to buy two items: jewelry for $5,000 and electrical equipment for $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to grow 2.5% and the electrical equipment market to grow 1.2% in the same month. If the seller offers to make a profit at the end of the month, what is the profit?	125	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Izimpahla zokugcina ziyaba yini?""

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Jewelry: $5,000 x 2.5% = $5,000 x 0.025 = $125
Electrical equipment: $8,000 x 1.2% = $8,000 x 0.012 = $96
Total profit: $125 + $96 = $221

So, the profit at the end of the month is $221. Ngiyabonga for asking!"	221
16	Two trains depart San Rafael at the same time. He starts heading east, both going 80 kilometers. On the last day, they go to the top, and cross 150 kilometers. How many trains will each train cross in two days?	230	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: Both trains travel 80 km each, so they cover a total distance of 80 km x 2 = 160 km.

Day 2: They travel an additional 150 km each, so they cover another 150 km x 2 = 300 km.

In total, each train will cover a distance of 80 km + 150 km = 230 km in two days.

So, each train will cross 230 kilometers in two days.

18	Claire eats three eggs a day as a snack. How many dozen eggs will she eat in four weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukudla kwakhe kwezinhlanu ziyasithupha ngosuku. Imizuzu emi-4, izinhlanu ezimbalwa ezayo?""

Now, let's calculate: Claire eats 3 eggs a day. In 4 weeks, that's 3 eggs/day × 7 days/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 84 eggs ÷ 12 = 7 dozen eggs.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Uzoyithola izinhlanu ezimbalwa ezi-7!"" (She will eat 7 dozen eggs!)"	7
19	Marrisa walked up a hill at twelve miles per hour. She walked the first four miles in one hour, and walked the next two miles in one hour. If she wanted to run at four miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down. Marrisa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and 2 miles in 1 hour. That's a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. She needs to cover the remaining distance, which is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

If she wants to cover the remaining distance at 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it would take: time = distance / speed = 6 miles / 4 mph = 1.5 hours.

Since she's already taken 2 hours to cover 6 miles, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in the same amount of time, which is 2 hours. To do this, she needs to walk at a speed of: speed = distance / time = 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

So, she needs to walk at 3 miles per hour to cover the rest of the way.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	3
20	I have two-thirds of a gallon of 10 liters of water and I want to add 15 liters of five-thirds of a gallon of water. But while I was pouring it, I spilled one gallon of water on the ground. How much water is left in the other 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* You have 2/3 of a gallon, which is 10 liters.
* You add 5/3 of a gallon, which is 20 liters (since 1 gallon = 4 liters).
* So, you now have 10 + 20 = 30 liters.
* You spill 1 gallon, which is 4 liters. So, you're left with 30 - 4 = 26 liters.
* You want to know how much water is left in the 24-liter container. Since you have 26 liters and the container can hold 24 liters, you'll have 26 - 24 = 2 liters left over.

So, the answer is: ""Kune liti 2 kulindile!"" (There are 2 liters left!)

21	Raymond and Samantha are siblings. Raymond was born six years before Samantha was born. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is 31 now, how many years later did she have a son?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. Samantha is 31 now, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had a son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old now.

If Samantha wants to have a son at the same age as Raymond (23), she will have to wait 23 - 31 = 8 years.

23	A candle has a rate of 2 meters-per-hour of illumination. What is the average length of each candle if it is illuminated from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Umthombo womoya ufika emakhulukweni angu-2 ngosuku. Imithombo yomoya iphi amakhulu kuze kube ngu-5:00 kusasa?""

Now, let's calculate the answer:

The candle is illuminated for 4 hours (from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm).

Rate of illumination = 2 meters per hour
Time = 4 hours

Distance illuminated = Rate × Time = 2 m/h × 4 h = 8 meters

So, the average length of each candle is 8 meters.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Imithombo yomoya iphi amakhulu ayi-8."" (The average length of each candle is 8 meters.)"	8
24	Kyle bought the book for $19.50 a month last year, which is 24 percent less than the actual price.	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the actual price of the book.

Let x be the actual price. Since Kyle bought it for 24% less, we can set up the equation:

19.50 = x - 0.24x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

19.50 = 0.76x

Dividing both sides by 0.76, we get:

x = 25.79

So, the actual price of the book is $25.79.

25	Marie ordered one chicken for $12, 5 boxes of milk for $3 each, five boxes for $1.50 each, and several boxes of pizza. All together Marie paid $50. What boxes of pizza did Marie buy for $8.50 each?	2	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie bought:

1 chicken = $12
5 boxes of milk = 5 x $3 = $15
5 boxes = 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
Total cost so far = $12 + $15 + $7.50 = $34.50

Marie paid $50 in total, so the cost of the pizza boxes is:
$50 - $34.50 = $15.50

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie bought:
$15.50 ÷ $8.50 = 1.82 (round down to 1, because you can't buy a fraction of a box)
Marie bought 1 box of pizza.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Marie wabonga ibhokisi elinye lephiza!"" (Marie bought one pizza box!)"	1

Mishka bought three socks, and each sock cost $16.50. To find out how much Mishka paid for all the socks, we multiply the number of socks by the price of each sock:

3 socks x $16.50 = $49.50

So, Mishka got $49.50 for all the socks.

28	Henry stopped twice for sixty yards while riding his iron horse. His two stops were for fifteen yards before he completed the course. What distance did he cross between his first and second stops?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Henry stopped twice, and each stop was for 15 yards. So, he stopped for a total of 15 + 15 = 30 yards.

He rode his iron horse for a total of 60 yards.

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the total stopped distance from the total distance:

60 - 30 = 30 yards

So, Henry crossed 30 yards between his first and second stops.

30	The difference between Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7:11. If both of them are 162 years old, find out how old Allen will be ten years from now.	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

U-Darrell no-Allen babengama iminyaka eyodwa, kodwa inani labo libuye liphakathi kwaba-7:11. Uma bobabili bengama iminyaka engu-162, sicela ukuthola iminyaka ka-Allen eminyakeni eyi-10 ezayo.

(Translation: Darrell and Allen have a difference in age, but their ages are in a ratio of 7:11. If both are 162 years old, please find out how old Allen will be in 10 years.)

Let's calculate:

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x.

We know that 7x + 11x = 162 (since their ages add up to 162).

Combine like terms: 18x = 162.

Divide by 18: x = 9.

Now, find Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99.

Ten years from now, Allen will be: 99 + 10 = 109.

So, in isiZulu: ""U-Allen uzoba ngumnyaka ongama-109 eminyakeni eyi-10 ezayo."" (Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years.)"	10
31	Gunter wants to count the number of leaves in a bottle. He asks how many friends they think are in one bottle. One says eighty. Another says twenty is half as much as the first. A third says fifty percent as much as the first. What is the average of all of them?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80 leaves.
2. The second friend says 20, which is half of 80, so 80 / 2 = 40.
3. The third friend says 50% of 80, which is 80 x 0.5 = 40.

Now, let's find the average:

(80 + 40 + 40) / 3 = 160 / 3 = 53.33

So, the average is 53.33 leaves.

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
The average points scored in 20 minutes is 4.
50% more than the average is 4 + (4 x 0.5) = 4 + 2 = 6 points.
So, in the next 20 minutes, Mike scores 6 points.
In total, Mike scores 4 + 6 = 10 points.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. 4 yogurts are sold for $5.00 each. How much money did he save on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, 1 yogurt costs $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25.

So, 60 yogurts cost 60 x $1.25 = $75.00.

If Terry didn't eat yogurts for 30 days, he would have spent $75.00. Since he did eat yogurts, he didn't spend that money. Therefore, he saved $75.00.

In isiZulu, ""Uyaphila imali engu-$75.00!"" (He saved $75.00!)"	75

39	He can run four times faster than a man, but he can run the rope twice as fast as he can run. If he throws the rope three times an hour, how long would it take him to cross it in six hours if he ran one of the boys three times and two of the boys three times?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me break this down for you in isiZulu:

Uyabonga ukuthi umuntu uyavuma ukuthi uyakhula kakhulu kunokuthi umuntu angakhuli, kodwa uyakhula igazi ngokukhulu kunokuthi uyakhula. Uma uyaphosa igazi izikhathi ezintathu ngesikhathi, ingakaphi izikhathi uma uyakhulula igazi ngokuthi uyakhulula abantwana abathathu ukuthi abantwana ababili bangakhulula ngokuthi bangakhulula?

Okay, let's get to the math part!

Let's say the man's running speed is x. Then, the boy's running speed is 4x.

The boy can run the rope twice as fast as he can run, so the rope's speed is 2 × 4x = 8x.

If he throws the rope three times an hour, that means the rope covers a distance of 8x × 3 = 24x in one hour.

In six hours, the rope will cover a distance of 24x × 6 = 144x.

Now, the boy runs one of the boys three times, which means he covers a distance of 4x × 3 = 12x.

He also runs two of the boys three times, which means he covers a distance of 2 × 4x × 3 = 24x.

Adding these distances, we get 12x + 24x = 36x.

To find the time it takes for the boy to cross the rope, we divide the total distance by his running speed: 144x ÷ 4x = 36.

So, it will take the boy 36 hours to cross the rope.

41	The great dragon, Perg, stayed on Farbo's back, breathing fire everywhere between him and the dragon for four thousand miles. Polly was able to cast a golden spell, the only weapon she knew that could catch the dragon, at a distance of four hundred miles, where the dragon's fire would hit her. But if Polly tied the silver stones, she would be able to cast the spell three times farther than it would cost. If she tied the stones, how far would she be able to cast a golden spell to stop the dragon without the dragon's fire?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthola!""

Now, let's solve the problem:

If Polly can cast the spell at 400 miles without the silver stones, and the stones would allow her to cast it three times farther, then:

400 miles x 3 = 1200 miles

Adding the original 400 miles, Polly would be able to cast the spell at:

400 miles + 1200 miles = 1600 miles

So, Polly would be able to cast the golden spell to stop the dragon without the dragon's fire at a distance of 1600 miles."	1600
42	Grandmother Jones prepared apple bread for the gathering of the fire-eaters. She broke each of the loaves into small pieces 8 and set the five loaves on the table for the guests to eat. When evening came, when all the guests had eaten their loaves, there were 14 small loaves left. How many small loaves did the guests take?	26	"Nkɛnkɛ! (Hello!)

Let's count the loaves, my friend! Grandmother Jones broke each loaf into 8 small pieces, and she had 5 loaves. That makes a total of 5 x 8 = 40 small loaves.

After the guests ate, 14 small loaves were left. To find out how many the guests took, we subtract the remaining loaves from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 small loaves!"	26
43	In nutrition terms, each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If 300g of chips has 5 calories per serving, how many grams can you eat per day if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per serving?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kwakudla ukudla okukhulu!"" (Let's do the big calculation!)

To find out how many grams you can eat per day, we need to calculate how many servings are in 2000 calories.

First, let's find out how many calories are in 1 gram of chips: 5 calories per serving ÷ 300g = 0.0167 calories per gram (approximately).

Now, let's calculate how many grams are in 2000 calories: 2000 calories ÷ 0.0167 calories per gram ≈ 119,940 grams.

So, you can eat approximately 119,940 grams of chips per day to reach your food energy goal of 2000 calories. However, please keep in mind that it's not healthy to consume such a large amount of chips daily!"	2000
44	Christie wants to sell a pair of pencils. For each pound of pencils, she can make 10 films. Each pound of pencils and the book is $10.00. If she sells each pencil for $2.00, how much profit will she make if she sells 20 pencils?	20	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 pound of pencils and a book = $10.00
Christie can make 10 films from 1 pound of pencils, so cost of 1 film = $10.00 ÷ 10 = $1.00
Since each pencil is sold for $2.00, Christie makes a profit of $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 per pencil
If she sells 20 pencils, her total profit = 20 x $1.00 = $20.00

Wo yɛ Christie! (Christie is happy!) She'll make a profit of $20.00!"	20

Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule:

* On Mondays, she writes 5 papers.
* On Tuesdays, she writes 2/5 papers, which is equivalent to 0.4 papers.

Let's solve the problem!

Candice had 80 cards initially and bought a box of cards. After using one card to buy 220 cups of coffee, she had 23 cards left. To find the number of cards in the box, we can set up an equation:

80 (initial cards) + x (cards in the box) - 1 (card used) = 23 (cards left)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 1 = 23

x = 23 - 80 + 1
x = 56

So, the box of cards Candice bought contained 56 cards!"	56
47	John bought two red rings for twice the price of two rings. The price of the red rings was two percent less than the price of the two rings, which was $40 each. How much money did he spend on the ring?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Two rings cost $40 each, so the total cost is 2 x $40 = $80.

The red rings cost 2% less, which is $80 - (2% of $80) = $80 - $1.60 = $78.40.

Since John bought two red rings for twice the price of two rings, he spent 2 x $78.40 = $156.80.

Let's convert the length of the rope from feet to inches: 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Since Tracy cut each film of rope to a length of 6 inches, we can divide the total length by 6:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy got 8 films of rope."	8
49	Richard lives in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, three-quarters of which are occupied. How many rooms are occupied in the building?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Three-quarters of the rooms are occupied, so we multiply by 3/4 = 0.75
* 120 rooms x 0.75 = 90 rooms occupied

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 90 rooms occupied in the building."	90

Tom uya futha 10 times ngehora. Ufutha kusuka ku-1 kuya ku-4 ngehora. Uma efuna ekuya, ufutha 6 times ngehora.

Now, let's calculate:

Tom flies 10 times an hour, but he only flies from 1 to 4 times an hour, so let's take the average: (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5 times an hour.

When he flies back, he flies 6 times an hour.

So, in total, Tom flies 2.5 + 6 = 8.5 times an hour."	8
52	Uriah's sack contained ten birds. He must have taken 15 pounds from it. Each of his sacks weighed 1⁄4 pound and each of his sacks was 1⁄2 pound. If he took 30 sacks, would he have taken any more sacks?	15	"Ndi Igbo, o di mma! (That's Igbo for ""It's good, my friend!"")

Let's break it down:

Uriah had 10 birds, and each bird weighed 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the birds is:
10 birds × 1/4 pound/bird = 2.5 pounds

He also had 30 sacks, each weighing 1/2 pound, so the total weight of the sacks is:
30 sacks × 1/2 pound/sack = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the weights of the birds and sacks:
2.5 pounds (birds) + 15 pounds (sacks) = 17.5 pounds

Uriah took 15 pounds from the sack, which means he still has:
17.5 pounds - 15 pounds = 2.5 pounds left

Since each sack weighs 1/2 pound, he can still take:
2.5 pounds ÷ 1/2 pound/sack = 5 more sacks

So, yes, Uriah can take 5 more sacks!"	5

If you add the box and the empty box, the total weight is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding the capacity of the bridge?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inani lezibuko ezinhle. (Let me help you find the number of boxes.)

Izibuko ezinhle zisebenza ngokuthi: (The boxes work like this:)

 Ukudla kwesibuko esingena = 15 pounds (The weight of one box is 15 pounds)

 Ukudla kwesibuko esingena nesibuko esingenasipho = 3755 pounds (The weight of one box and an empty box is 3755 pounds)

 Ukudla kwesibuko esingenasipho = Ukudla kwesibuko esingena nesibuko esingenasipho - Ukudla kwesibuko esingena
= 3755 pounds - 15 pounds
= 3740 pounds (The weight of an empty box is 3740 pounds)

 Ukudla okudingeka kwesibuko = 5000 pounds - Ukudla kwesibuko esingenasipho
= 5000 pounds - 3740 pounds
= 1260 pounds (The weight needed to reach the capacity of the bridge is 1260 pounds)

 Inani lezibuko = Ukudla okudingeka kwesibuko ÷ Ukudla kwesibuko esingena

Let's break it down:

Total cost of items = $40.00
Surcharge = 25% of $40.00 = $10.00
Postage = $3.00
Return charge = $4.00

Total amount Stephen paid = $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 - $4.00 = $49.00

60	There's a piece of paper that weighs 25 pounds that's one-tenth as much, one-twentieth as much, two-tenths as much, and the rest is fine. How much is fine?	17	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* One-tenth of 25 pounds is 25/10 = 2.5 pounds
* One-twentieth of 25 pounds is 25/20 = 1.25 pounds
* Two-tenths of 25 pounds is 2/10 × 25 = 5 pounds

Adding these up, we get: 2.5 + 1.25 + 5 = 8.75 pounds

To find the rest, subtract from the total: 25 - 8.75 = 16.25 pounds

So, the rest is 16.25 pounds. In isiZulu, we say ""Kubalulekile ukuthola 16.25 amapondo!"" (It's fine to get 16.25 pounds!)"	16

Janet paid $500 for the perfume or $800 for the jewelry. We don't know which one, so we'll calculate both options.

Option 1: Perfume - $500
Option 2: Jewelry - $800

She paid 10% to protect it, so we'll calculate 10% of each option:

Option 1: 10% of $500 = $50
Option 2: 10% of $800 = $80

Now, let's add the protection fee to each option:

Option 1: $500 + $50 = $550
Option 2: $800 + $80 = $880

So, Janet paid either $550 or $880.

Ukuba umuntu wayethola $140 ngomzuzu, kuthiwa wayethola $140 x 12 = $1680 ngonyaka. (If the person was paid $140 per month, that means they earned $140 x 12 = $1680 per year.)

Kuthiwa, isikhathi sokuqala kweminyaka, umuntu wayethola 10% walezi $1680, kuthiwa $1680 x 0.1 = $168. (In the first half of the year, the person earned 10% of $1680, which is $1680 x 0.1 = $168.)

Isikhathi sesibili kweminyaka, umuntu wayethola 10% walezi $1680, kuthiwa $1680 x 0.1 = $168. (In the second half of the year, the person earned 10% of $1680, which is $1680 x 0.1 = $168.)

Kuthiwa, umuntu wayepha $168 + $168 = $336 kumabhizinisi wakhe. (So, the person paid $168 + $168 = $336 to the film company.)

64	Sophia is planning to take her car on a trip, and she wants to see where each tank of fuel will take her. She has cut 100 gallons of oil since she put it in the tank and needs to put 4 gallons of oil in it before filling it again. The doctor's note on the tank says that the tank can hold 12 gallons of oil.	300	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U Sophiya ufisa ukubona ukuthi iphi na iphi igazi lakhe liyokuthola. Uyabonga ukuthi ufakile amagali ayi-100, futhi ufisa ukufaka amagali ayi-4 ukuze akwazi ukufakela kabili. Inqwaba ithi igazi lakhe lina amagali ayi-12.""

Now, let's calculate how far each tank of fuel will take Sophia:

Sophia has used 100 gallons and needs to add 4 gallons to fill the tank. That means she has used 100 - 4 = 96 gallons.

Since the tank holds 12 gallons, she can travel:

96 ÷ 12 = 8 times

before needing to refuel again.

Ukubonga, Sophia! (Good luck, Sophia!)"	8
65	Jim watches TV for 2 hours before he plans to go to bed and reads books for two and a half hours. That's three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in a week?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads books for 2.5 hours, that's a total of 2 + 2.5 = 4.5 hours per day.

He does this three times a week, so we multiply 4.5 hours by 3:

4.5 hours/day × 3 days/week = 13.5 hours/week

So, Jim spends 13.5 hours watching TV and reading in a week.

68	There are twice as many men as women at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 men and 50 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If there are twice as many men as women, that means the number of women is half the number of men. Since there are 60 men, the number of women is 60 / 2 = 30.

The total number of students is the sum of men and women: 60 + 30 = 90.

If there are 50 students for every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 50 to find the number of teachers: 90 ÷ 50 = 1.8.

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 2 teachers.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day, Monday to Friday, that's 5 x 5 = 25 classes.

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so in total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so she teaches 33 x 15 = 495 students.

Sheila bought 5 luxury cars for $150 each, so the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.

Since she paid over 3 months, she can divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment: $750 ÷ 3 = $250 per month.

However, she also paid interest on each car. To find the total interest paid, we need more information about the interest rate. If the interest rate is x%, then the total interest paid would be $750 x (x/100).

Let's assume the interest rate is 5%. Then, the total interest paid would be $750 x (5/100) = $37.50.

To find the monthly payment including interest, Sheila can add the interest to the total cost and divide by 3: ($750 + $37.50) ÷ 3 = $262.50 per month.

So, Sheila can pay $262.50 per month for 3 months to cover the cost of the 5 luxury cars, including interest.

Translation: Ah, Vincent can buy three boxes of flowers for $2.50, or two boxes for $1. How much will he save for 18 flowers?

Let's calculate: 
If Vincent buys 3 boxes for $2.50, then 1 box is $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83. 
For 18 flowers, he needs 18 ÷ 3 = 6 boxes. 
So, he'll spend 6 × $0.83 = $5. 
If he buys 2 boxes for $1, then 1 box is $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50. 
For 18 flowers, he needs 18 ÷ 2 = 9 boxes. 
So, he'll spend 9 × $0.50 = $4.50.

Let's break it down:

* Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of atomic particles.
* Each infant eats half of the adult's, which is 10/2 = 5 lbs.

Ngifundisa ukuthi (Let me explain)...

Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald ran it twice as slow, so Gerald's original time is 38 x 2 = 76 seconds.

Gerald increased his speed by 10%, which means he reduced his time by 10%. To find 10% of 76, I calculate: 76 x 0.1 = 7.6 seconds.

Now, subtract 7.6 seconds from Gerald's original time: 76 - 7.6 = 68.4 seconds.

However, the question states that Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles in 30 seconds, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 68.4 seconds.

94	In a neighborhood, there are fewer four pets than there are twelve dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, how many cats are there in the neighborhood?	348	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend!

Let the number of dogs be x. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2x.

The total number of dogs and cats is x + 2x = 3x.

We know that the number of dogs and cats is 12 more than the number of pets, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 4(pets) + 12

Since there are fewer four pets, let's assume the number of pets is 4y, where y is a positive integer.

Now, our equation becomes:

3x = 4(4y) + 12
3x = 16y + 12

To find the number of cats, we need to find x first. Let's try to find a combination of x and y that satisfies the equation.

After some trial and error, we find that x = 8 and y = 3 work:

3(8) = 16(3) + 12
24 = 48 + 12
24 = 24

So, there are 8 dogs and 2(8) = 16 cats in the neighborhood!

* 2/5 of the 200 students are male, so the number of male students is:
(2/5) × 200 = 80 male students
* That means the number of female students is:
200 - 80 = 120 female students
* Now, 2/3 of the female students are in the women's group, so the number of female students in the women's group is:
(2/3) × 120 = 80 female students in the women's group

So, there are 80 male students and 80 female students in the women's group.

100	Jerome had 4 friends visiting him in a day. The first friend knocked on the door 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second friend knocked on the door 1⁄4 more times than Jerome's first friend. The third friend knocked on the door 10 times than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend knocked on the door 60 times, how many times did the door knock?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* The first friend knocked 20 times.
* The second friend knocked 1/4 more times than the first friend, so that's 20 + (20 x 1/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
* The fourth friend knocked 60 times.
* The third friend knocked 10 times more than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the knocks: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The door was knocked 175 times."	175

103	If the city is 42 square kilometers from the end of the sea to the opposite end of the earth, how many minutes would it take to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ah, ngicabanga ukuthi (I think) there might be some misunderstanding. The question seems to be asking about the time it would take to cover the entire city, but the distance given is from the end of the sea to the opposite end of the earth, which is not a feasible or realistic measurement for a city.

However, if we assume the distance of 42 square kilometers is the area of the city, we would need to know the mode of transportation and the speed at which one is traveling to estimate the time it would take to cover the entire city.

For example, if we assume a moderate walking pace of about 5 kilometers per hour, it would take around 8.4 hours to cover 42 kilometers. Converted to minutes, that would be approximately 504 minutes.

But please clarify or provide more context, ngicela (I request), so I can better understand and provide a more accurate answer."	504

On Thursdays, he watches a movie that is an hour long and a movie that is 30 minutes long. On Fridays, he finds that he is bored so he watches two movies that are an hour long. Out of the total of 7 hours, a movie that is 30 minutes long he watches on Wednesdays.	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that.

Frankie watches TV for a total of 7 hours. Let's break it down:

* Mondays and Tuesdays: 2 hours (1 hour each night)
* Wednesdays: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
* Thursdays: 1.5 hours (1 hour + 0.5 hours)
* Fridays: 2 hours (2 hours)

Adding all up, we get: 2 + 2 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Out of the total 7 hours, the 30-minute movie on Wednesdays is 0.5 hours. To find the percentage, multiply by 100: (0.5 / 7) * 100 = 7.14%

So, the answer is: 7.14%

Let's calculate the cost of the oil:

10 barrels of oil x $3.00 per barrel = $30.00

The company will give $0.20 back for every barrel, so:

The customer will get $2.00 back, so they will pay:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

111	Tokuro came to Julia's boat while she was on the lake. Two liters of water flowed into the boat four times out of every ten minutes she spent on land. She walked for sixteen minutes and walked twelve times out of every ten minutes. The land was after 64 degrees. How much water flowed into the boat when Julia reached the land?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me help you with that question. Since Julia walked 12 times out of every 10 minutes, and she walked for 16 minutes, she spent 16 x (12/10) = 19.2 minutes on land.

Since 2 liters of water flowed into the boat 4 times out of every 10 minutes, the total water that flowed into the boat is 2 x (4/10) x 19.2 = 15.36 liters.

So, when Julia reached the land, 15.36 liters of water had flowed into the boat.

If the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 1800, how many photographs will be taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Let the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo be x.

The number of photographs taken by tourists in Brittany is 50 times more than the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo, so it's 50x.

The number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 1800, and it's 6 times that of Brittany, so:

1800 = 6 × 50x
1800 = 300x
x = 1800 ÷ 300
x = 6

So, the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo is 6.

(That's great!) Let's calculate the profit Sasha will make.

The 2 x 4 x 10 tables cost $10 each, and she has 10 of them. Since the price has gone up by 50%, she can sell each one for $15 (150% of $10). So, she'll make 10 x $15 = $150 from the 2 x 4 x 10 tables.

The 4 x 4 x 10 tables cost $16 each, and she has 5 of them. With the 50% price increase, she can sell each one for $24 (150% of $16). So, she'll make 5 x $24 = $120 from the 4 x 4 x 10 tables.

In total, Sasha will make $150 + $120 = $270.

116	Katy uses a teaspoon of sugar and a cup of water in a ratio of 7:13 for coffee. If in total, she used 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.	42	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem together.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. Let's find the total parts: 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar and water in total, we can set up the equation:

(7/20) × Total = 120

To find the total, multiply both sides by 20:

7 × Total = 120 × 20
Total = 2400

Now, to find the amount of sugar used, multiply the total by the ratio of sugar:

Sugar = (7/20) × 2400
Sugar = 840

So, Katy used 840 teaspoons of sugar.

119	Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries are higher, and Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago, what is the difference between their salaries?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Lylah's salary four years ago = x
Adrien's salary four years ago = 1.3x (30% higher)

Lylah's salary now = 1.4x (40% higher)
Adrien's salary now = 1.3x + 400,000

Since Adrien's salary is still 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

1.3x + 400,000 = 1.3(1.4x)
1.3x + 400,000 = 1.82x

Subtract 1.3x from both sides:
400,000 = 0.52x

Divide by 0.52:
x = 769,231

Now, let's find the difference between their salaries:
Adrien's salary now = 1.3x + 400,000 = 1.3(769,231) + 400,000 = 1,099,900
Lylah's salary now = 1.4x = 1.4(769,231) = 1,076,524

The difference between their salaries is:
1,099,900 - 1,076,524 = 23,376

Let's break it down:

Monday: Sadie slept 8 hours.

Thursday to Sunday: She slept 1 hour less than Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 6 - 1 = 5 hours each day. Total for these four days is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 hours.

Adding all the hours together, Sadie slept 8 + 12 + 20 = 40 hours during the week.

Later, her owner also bought 5 more bags of earrings for Julia. While Julia was preparing to give away earrings, three of the bags of earrings touched her ears. After she closed the door, she had 12 earrings. How many bags of earrings did Julia buy?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Wabonga imiqholo engaba yimuphi, umnikazi wakhe wabonga amaqhinga amahlanu anamandla. (She bought another pair, and her owner also bought 5 more bags.)
Amaqhinga amathathu athuthuka amehlo kaJulia. (Three of the bags touched Julia's ears.)
Wahamba wahamba, waba nesiqholo esiyi-12. (After all that, she had 12 earrings.)

Let's count the earrings:
Julia bought 1 pair (2 earrings) initially.
Her owner bought 5 bags, and each bag had an unknown number of earrings.
Three bags touched Julia's ears, so that's 3 bags x 2 earrings each = 6 earrings.
In total, Julia had 12 earrings.

Now, let's find the number of earrings in each bag:
12 (total earrings) - 2 (initial earrings) - 6 (earrings from 3 bags) = 4 earrings
Since 3 bags had 6 earrings, each bag had 6 / 3 = 2 earrings.
The 5 bags had 5 x 2 = 10 earrings.
Julia bought 1 pair (2 earrings) initially, so the total earrings were 10 + 2 = 12.

128	Did his mother sell watermelons, coconuts, and apples in the store? A watermelon costs three times as much as a coconut. It costs five times less than a watermelon. Dillon is sent to the store to buy four watermelons and twenty coconuts and ten apples. If each coconut costs $15, how much money will he get?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* A coconut costs $15.
* A watermelon costs three times as much as a coconut, so it's 3 x $15 = $45.
* An apple costs five times less than a watermelon, so it's $45 ÷ 5 = $9.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 watermelons = 4 x $45 = $180
* 20 coconuts = 20 x $15 = $300
* 10 apples = 10 x $9 = $90

Total cost = $180 + $300 + $90 = $570

Dillon will need $570.

129	One hospital sees five hundred patients a day. One patient is seen every forty minutes. The doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital get from these visits?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 500 patients a day
* 1 patient every 40 minutes = 1.5 patients per hour (since 60 minutes ÷ 40 minutes = 1.5)
* So, the hospital sees 500 ÷ 1.5 = 333.33 hours of patients per day (approximately)
* The doctor charges $150 per hour, so the doctor's cost is 333.33 hours × $150 = $50,000 per day
* The hospital charges $200 per hour, so the hospital's revenue is 333.33 hours × $200 = $66,667 per day
* The hospital's profit is the revenue minus the doctor's cost: $66,667 - $50,000 = $16,667 per day

130	Nissa hired sixty part-time workers to work as caterpillars at her factory in Santa's village. One-third of the caterpillars died when the children spat on them, and ten percent of the remaining caterpillars died when the children got down on their knees. How many caterpillars are left?	30	"Ekuabo! (Ahaha!) Let's break it down.

Nissa started with 60 caterpillars.

One-third of 60 died, which is 60 ÷ 3 = 20.

So, 60 - 20 = 40 caterpillars remained.

Then, 10% of the remaining 40 died, which is 40 × 0.1 = 4.

So, 40 - 4 = 36 caterpillars are left.

Pam boarded 2 trains, Fred boarded 4 trains. Together, they boarded 2 + 4 = 6 trains.

Then, each of them boarded 2 boats, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 boats.

In total, they used 6 trains + 4 boats = 10 tickets.

One-fifth of 27 gates are in the Scottish Highlands, so:
27 ÷ 5 = 5.4 (round down to 5 gates in Scotland)

137	Rory offers to give her two cruise ships for $7.50 each, two suitcases for $1.50, and two cats for $1.00 each for delivery. Twenty percent is added to the shipping cost and $5.00 is added. What will her organization buy?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me calculate the total cost for Rory's offer:

2 cruise ships = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 suitcases = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cats = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Adding 20% shipping cost: $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
Total cost with shipping = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Adding $5.00: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Her organization will buy 2 cruise ships, 2 suitcases, and 2 cats for $29.00.

If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions would he have missed?"""	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions in 1 hour. To find out how many questions he can complete in 8 hours, multiply 5 by 8:
5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions

Mark had 75 questions in the first test, so to find out how many he missed:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions missed

For the second test, Mark still completes 5 questions in 1 hour. To find out how many questions he can complete in 6 hours, multiply 5 by 6:
5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions

Mark had 100 questions in the second test, so to find out how many he missed:
100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions missed

In total, Mark would have missed 35 + 70 = 105 questions.

144	Kim has started her own housekeeping business, calculating her weekly income from her clients. She already has 3 clients, but talks to those who could be her top 5 clients, and feels confident to include them in her plan. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and one trash bag to be washed. Ntoa bleach costs $2 a bottle, and a suit costs about $5. These are the cost of slaves. She estimates her weekly income to be $92. The profit is the difference between total income and total expenditure, so how much profit would Lucas, in dollars, make per week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Kim has 5 clients in total, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 trash bag. So, the total cost of bleach is:

2 bottles/client × 5 clients = 10 bottles
10 bottles × $2/bottle = $20

The total cost of trash bags is:

1 bag/client × 5 clients = 5 bags
5 bags × $5/bag = $25

Total expenditure = $20 (bleach) + $25 (trash bags) = $45

Kim's weekly income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenditure from the total income:

Profit = Total income - Total expenditure
= $92 - $45
= $47

So, Kim's weekly profit is $47.

Ngicela ukuthi Johnny unefile le-500 + le-1500 + le-2000 = 4000 amafilm. (So, Johnny has 500 + 1500 + 2000 = 4000 films.)

She saw bees that were 1/2 as many as she had seen before coming out of the hive, and the bees moved in and out of the hive for the next 6 hours. After that, each bee that had withdrawn before returning returned to the office for the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see come back into the hive in the last 6 hours?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees coming out of the hive.

In the next 6 hours, half of them came back, which is 30 ÷ 2 = 15 bees.

Then, she saw bees that were half as many as she had seen before coming out of the hive. Since she saw 30 bees initially, half of that is 30 ÷ 2 = 15 bees.

So, in total, 15 + 15 = 30 bees had gone out of the hive.

In the last 6 hours, each bee that had withdrawn before returning came back to the hive. This means all 30 bees that had gone out came back in.

Therefore, Debra saw 30 bees come back into the hive in the last 6 hours.

Let's break this down:

Steve cycles at 440 feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's speed is:

440 feet/minute ÷ 5280 feet/mile = 0.0833 miles/minute

Since Steve lives 2 miles away, it'll take him:

2 miles ÷ 0.0833 miles/minute = 24 minutes

to get to school.

Now, let's look at Tim. He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so his speed is:

264 feet/minute ÷ 5280 feet/mile = 0.05 miles/minute

Since Tim also lives 2 miles away, it'll take him:

2 miles ÷ 0.05 miles/minute = 40 minutes

to get to school.

The winner, Steve, will arrive 16 minutes before Tim (40 - 24 = 16). So, Steve will wait at home for 16 minutes before Tim completes the race.

151	Shawnda imagines that the kids in her neighborhood can use the iron horses to work. She imagines that the best way to pay for it is to buy tires. Each of the tires costs 25 cents if there are too many. On the first day, 5 riders on iron horses came to get enough for two tires. 3 people came to assemble high-quality iron horse tires. and finally, one person brought one iron horse. How many dollars did he make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

5 riders came to get enough for 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
3 people came to assemble high-quality iron horse tires, but it doesn't say how many tires they got, so we'll ignore this part for now.
1 person brought 1 iron horse, but it doesn't say how many tires they got either, so we'll ignore this part too.

So, Shawnda sold 10 tires in total. Each tire costs 25 cents, so she made 10 x 25 cents = 250 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 250 cents ÷ 100 = 2.5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 2.5 dollars that day.

Carl buys 10 bags of cookies, each with 6 cookies, so he has 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6.

153	Dave bought a lot of french fries, and ate fourteen before a hungry shorebird stole them from his mouth. When the shorebird landed, he headed up where Dave ate half of them. Then the pigeon got angry and forced him to pull him away from the food, and each of the pigeons ate three of the food. Later, the raccoon stole the remaining two-thirds of the food. The ants took the last french fry he had bought, and left the five there. When Dave bought it, how many french fries were in the box?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the story:

* Dave ate 14 fries initially.
* The shorebird stole the rest, and Dave ate half of what was left. This means the shorebird stole an even number of fries, since Dave ate half of it. Let's call this number 2x.
* The pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were multiple pigeons, so let's assume there were 2 pigeons (to make the math easier). They ate a total of 2 x 3 = 6 fries.
* The raccoon stole 2/3 of what was left. This means 1/3 of the remaining fries were left.
* The ants took 1 fry, leaving 5 fries.

Now, let's work backwards:

* The ants took 1 fry, so there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries left.
* The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so 1/3 of the remaining fries were 6. This means the total number of fries before the raccoon stole them was 6 x 3 = 18.
* The pigeons ate 6 fries, so there were 18 + 6 = 24 fries before the pigeons ate.
* Dave ate half of what was left after the shorebird stole the fries. This means the shorebird stole 24 x 2 = 48 fries.
* Dave initially ate 14 fries, so the total number of fries in the box was 14 + 48 = 62.

So, when Dave bought the fries, there were 62 french fries in the box.

* A hen needs 200 leaves per month, so in 2 months, it needs 200 x 2 = 400 leaves.
* A duck needs 400 corn per month, so in 2 months, it needs 400 x 2 = 800 corn.
* A turtle needs 100 corn per month, so in 2 months, it needs 100 x 2 = 200 corn.

Kelly runs backwards and forwards once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run with Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and backwards. She does this 34 times. How does the winner run farther than the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Blake runs 15 yards backwards and forwards, so that's 30 yards per round. Since the field is 100 yards long, Blake can run 3 rounds and still have 10 yards left. So, Blake runs 3 x 30 = 90 yards, plus the remaining 10 yards, making it a total of 100 yards.

Kelly runs backwards and forwards once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs 34 times from the 40-yard line to the 0-yard line and back, which is 80 yards per round. So, Kelly runs 100 + 34 x 80 = 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

The winner, Kelly, runs farther than the loser, Blake, by 2720 yards.

159	Finn observes eleven beetles swimming in the pond. Suddenly, he sees six of them emerge from their hiding place under the flowers, and then he sees nine of them emerge from their hiding place under a rock. How many beetles can Finn see in the pond now?	15	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's count!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Finn started with 11 beetles. Then, 6 emerged from under the flowers, and 9 emerged from under the rock. That's a total of 6 + 9 = 15 new beetles.

So, Finn can see 11 (initial beetles) + 15 (new beetles) = 26 beetles in the pond now!

161	Anakin and Locsin went ashore today. Anakin caught 10 stars, 6 horses, and 3 large fish. While Locsin caught 5 stars more than Anakin, 3 horses more than Anakin, and 2 larger fish than Anakin. How many fish were caught?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Anakin caught 10 stars, 6 horses, and 3 large fish.
Locsin caught 5 stars more than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 + 5 = 15 stars.
Locsin caught 3 horses more than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 + 3 = 9 horses.
Locsin caught 2 larger fish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 large fish.

In total, they caught 10 + 15 = 25 stars, 6 + 9 = 15 horses, and 3 + 5 = 8 large fish.

So, the answer is: 8 large fish were caught.

162	If the price of a bag of jewelry is $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then what is the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase again = 20% of $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase again = 20% of $28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase again = 20% of $34.56 = $6.91
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
Increase again = 20% of $41.47 = $8.29
New price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
Increase again = 20% of $49.76 = $9.95
New price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
Increase again = 20% of $59.71 = $11.94
New price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
Increase again = 20% of $71.65 = $14.33
New price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
Increase again = 20% of $85.98 = $17.20
New price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
Increase again = 20% of $103.18 = $20.64
New price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
Increase again = 20% of $123.82 = $24.77
New price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.77 = $148.59
Increase again = 20% of $148.59 = $29.72
New price after 24 months = $148.59 + $29.72 = $178.31
Increase again = 20% of $178.31 = $35.66
New price after 26 months = $178.31 + $35.66 = $213.97
Increase again = 20% of $213.97 = $42.79
New price after 28 months = $213.97 + $42.79 = $256.76
Increase again = 20% of $256.76 = $51.35
New price after 30 months = $256.76 + $51.35 = $308.11

So, the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months is $308.11.

165	When Elvira was 30 years old, she received a new computer that many considered a gift. She had a total of €1500 in her household savings and thought she could save some money to buy the fabric. She went to the computer department and bought a new computer for €1090 that included a mirror, keyboard and mouse mouthpiece. She also bought a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74 and a printer for €102. How much money would she have to spend on her clothes?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much money Elvira has left to spend on her clothes.

She had €1500 initially and spent:

€1090 on the computer
€157 on the scanner
€74 on the CD burner
€102 on the printer

Total amount spent = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

So, she has €1500 - €1423 = €77 left to spend on her clothes.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Uyaphila imali engu-77 ukuthenga izicathama zakhe."" (She has €77 left to buy her clothes.)"	77
166	Sandra's housekeeper gives her four baskets of eggs every time she cares for their daughter. To make Spanish fries, she needs three eggs. If Sandra is assigned to make Spanish fries for her school fees, how many times does Sandra have to look after the children?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sandra needs 3 eggs to make Spanish fries.
She gets 4 baskets of eggs each time she cares for the children.
Let's assume each basket has the same number of eggs (we're not told otherwise).

To find out how many eggs Sandra gets each time, we'll multiply the number of baskets by the number of eggs per basket (unknown). Let's call the number of eggs per basket ""x"".

4 baskets × x eggs/basket = 4x eggs

Now, we know Sandra needs 3 eggs to make Spanish fries. To find out how many times she needs to care for the children, we'll divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time:

Let's say Sandra needs to make y Spanish fries. Then, she'll need:
3 eggs/fry × y fries = 3y eggs

Now, we'll set up the equation:
4x eggs = 3y eggs

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 4:
x = (3y) / 4

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of an egg!), we'll find the smallest value of y that makes x a whole number.

Let's try y = 4:
x = (3 × 4) / 4 = 3 eggs/basket

So, Sandra gets 4 baskets × 3 eggs/basket = 12 eggs each time she cares for the children.

To make 4 Spanish fries, she'll need:
3 eggs/fry × 4 fries = 12 eggs

Which means she only needs to care for the children once!"	12
167	Seth is three times as old as Brooke. In two years, they're about twenty years older. How old is Seth?	16	"""Seth oyi abuo Brooke ukwu. Mgbe abuo afọ gasị, ha dị afọ iri abuo. Olee afọ Seth dị?"" (Igbo language)

Let's break it down:

Let Brooke's age be x. Then Seth's age is 3x.

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 3x + 2.

The total of their ages in two years is x + 2 + 3x + 2 = 20.

Combine like terms: 4x + 4 = 20.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 4x = 16.

Divide by 4: x = 4.

So Brooke is 4 years old, and Seth is 3x = 3(4) = 12 years old.

""Olee afọ Seth dị? Seth dị afọ iri na abuo."" (How old is Seth? Seth is 12 years old.)"	12

Let's break it down:

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks:
20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day, which is:
10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

In total, Pancho walks:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

* Hat costs $25
* Jacket costs 3 times as much as the hat, so $25 x 3 = $75

In Zulu, I'll say: ""Sawubona! (Hello!)""

Okay, let's break it down:

1. Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are one year old, which means Sally Four is 1 year old.
2. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, so Sally Four is 8 - 1 = 7 years younger than Sally Thirtytwo.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 × 1 = 2 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 2 + 3 = 5 years old.

So, the ages of the four birds are:

* Sally Four: 1 year old
* Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old
* Granny Red: 2 years old
* Sally Two: 5 years old

They sell lemonade for $3 and sugar for $2, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5. They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 for each bottle. Since they made a profit of $25, they must have sold $25 / $10 = 2.5 bottles. Since each bottle costs $5, they spent $5 x 2.5 = $12.50 on the lemonade.

He gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and $700 for his wife's budget and household expenses. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he make after all his allowances and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

* Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
* Gas bill: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
* Daughter's weekly expenses: $200
* Wife's budget and household expenses: $700

Total expenses = $1,500 + $2,000 + $200 + $700 = $4,400

Now, let's calculate how much Zaid will have left:

$6,000 (monthly income) - $4,400 (total expenses) = $1,600

So, Zaid will have $1,600 left after all his allowances and donations.

178	Rani has more cards than Monic, who has four cards than Bo. If Bo has forty cards, add the number of cards that all three of them have together.	122	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Bo has 40 cards.
Monic has 4 more cards than Bo, so Monic has 40 + 4 = 44 cards.
Rani has more cards than Monic, so Rani has more than 44 cards. Let's assume Rani has x cards. Since Rani has more cards than Monic, x > 44. We can write an equation: x - 44 = number of cards Rani has more than Monic. We don't know the exact number, but we can add the cards they have together.

Total cards = Bo's cards + Monic's cards + Rani's cards
= 40 + 44 + x
= 84 + x

Since we don't know the exact number of cards Rani has, we can't give an exact total. But we know it's more than 84.

If the winner receives 4/3 of the votes, that means the winner got 4 parts out of 3 parts.

To find the total number of parts, we add 4 parts (winner) and 1 part (loser), which gives us 5 parts.

She has also ordered 200 red flowers, which is five times more than white flowers. Sandra has said that if the missing red flowers are not delivered by 5 pm, she will change the delivery person. In order for Sandra's work to continue, how many red flowers does Fred have to order for 5 orders?	160	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question! Let me help Sandra and Fred out.

Sandra has ordered 200 red flowers, which is five times more than white flowers. To find the number of white flowers, we can divide 200 by 5:

200 ÷ 5 = 40

So, Sandra has ordered 40 white flowers. Since she ordered four more red flowers than white flowers, we can set up an equation:

Red flowers = White flowers + 4
Red flowers = 40 + 4
Red flowers = 44

To find the total number of red flowers needed, we add the 200 already ordered to the 44 missing ones:

Total red flowers = 200 + 44
Total red flowers = 244

For 5 orders, Fred needs to order:

244 ÷ 5 = 48.8

Since we can't order a fraction of a flower, Fred needs to order 49 red flowers for each of the 5 orders.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Fred kufanele abuye amathuluzi angu-49 ngalokho kusasa ukuthi Sandra asethembe isikhathi sakhe."" (Fred must bring 49 red flowers for each order so that Sandra can continue with her work on time.)"	49

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years older than Jan. If Jan is currently 30, then two years ago, Jan was 28. So, Mark was 28 + 5.5 = 33.5 years old two years ago. That makes Mark currently 35.5 years old.

Now, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 35.5 + 2 = 37.5 years old.

183	Athletic teams compete in long distance events ranging from 4 meters to 400 meters; each team consists of four athletes who each run 400 meters, or one leg on a standard track. One of the two teams is an equal-sized team, with each athlete running approximately 55 laps. The other teams are not the same; the first athlete runs for 60 minutes, and then each of the runners runs 3 minutes faster than the first. Using these data, how many teams will be fastest?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

Team 1: Each athlete runs 55 laps × 400 meters = 22,000 meters.

Team 2:
Athlete 1 runs for 60 minutes. Convert minutes to meters: 60 minutes × (400 meters / 4 minutes) = 6000 meters.
Athlete 2 runs 3 minutes faster, so they run 6000 - 3 × (400 / 4) = 5820 meters.
Athlete 3 runs 3 minutes faster than Athlete 2, so they run 5820 - 3 × (400 / 4) = 5640 meters.
Athlete 4 runs 3 minutes faster than Athlete 3, so they run 5640 - 3 × (400 / 4) = 5460 meters.

Total distance for Team 2: 6000 + 5820 + 5640 + 5460 = 29,920 meters.

Since 22,000 meters (Team 1) is less than 29,920 meters (Team 2), Team 1 will be the fastest.

186	Russell worked in a butcher's shop and distributed feed for the animals. The 3 chickens were eaten in batches and each chick was given 6 chickens. More than 10 villages had only one chick, and each village was given 5 chickens. Also, there was a tent room where 20 chickens were distributed for the storage of the chickens.	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agree to give her two percent of her monthly salary. If Mandy can pay her after three months, how much should Benedict pay?	106	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Mandy owes Benedict $100. Mandy akanakho ukubonga Benedict ngomsebenzi wakhe wamalini, 2% yomsebenzi wakhe. Uma Mandy angakwazi ukubonga ngeminyaka emithathu, inani lezimali Benedict alizokuthola?

(Translation: Mandy owes Benedict $100. Mandy will pay Benedict 2% of her monthly salary. If Mandy can pay in three months, how much will Benedict get?)

Let's calculate:

Mandy's monthly payment = 2% of her monthly salary
= (2/100) × monthly salary
= 0.02 × monthly salary

Since Mandy will pay in three months, her total payment = 3 × monthly payment
= 3 × 0.02 × monthly salary
= 0.06 × monthly salary

We know Mandy owes Benedict $100, so:
0.06 × monthly salary = $100

To find Mandy's monthly salary, divide both sides by 0.06:
monthly salary = $100 ÷ 0.06
= $1666.67

Now, let's find out how much Benedict will get in three months:
Benedict's total payment = 3 × monthly payment
= 3 × 0.02 × $1666.67
= $100

Benedict will get $100 in three months."	100
188	A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. The merchant buys a sack of beans for $20 and transports it for $2, so the total cost per sack is $22. He sells each sack for $30, making a profit of $8 per sack ($30 - $22). To make a total profit of $400, he must sell:

$400 ÷ $8 = 50 sacks

So, the merchant sells 50 sacks of beans. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	50

Let's calculate the total cost: $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 = $57.75

191	A giraffe needs to eat 3.5 pounds of sunflower seeds to survive for eight days. If there are ten giraffes in a group, how many pounds of sunflower seeds do they need per day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One giraffe needs 3.5 pounds of sunflower seeds for 8 days, so for 1 day, it needs:
3.5 pounds ÷ 8 days = 0.4375 pounds per day

For 10 giraffes, they need:
0.4375 pounds/day × 10 giraffes = 4.375 pounds per day

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubalulekile ukuthi lezi-giraffe zisho ukudla amapondo ayisithupha neziphakeme zesunflower ngosuku olulodwa."" (It's important that these giraffes eat 4.375 pounds of sunflower seeds per day.)"	4
192	Tom planted ten trees a year. Each year he harvested two trees a year. He started with fifty trees. Ten years later, thirty percent of the trees were dead. How many trees were left?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tom started with 50 trees.
Each year, he planted 10 trees, so in 10 years, he planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees.
He harvested 2 trees each year, so in 10 years, he harvested 2 x 10 = 20 trees.
Now, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.
Thirty percent of the trees were dead, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.
So, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingama-91 ezisele ukuthola."" (There are 91 trees that are still standing.)"	91
193	Sue lives in a charming neighborhood. One weekend, the manager thought she was playing tricks on Sue. On Friday morning, the manager took out 18 red rubber socks in front of Sue. On Sunday morning, the manager took one-third of the socks, dressed them in white, and put the newly-refurbished white socks back in front of Sue. Then, 18 red socks were added to the rubber sock on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, how many more non-red rubber socks than non-white rubber socks?	24	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

On Friday, there were 18 red rubber socks.

On Sunday morning, the manager took one-third of the socks, which is 18 ÷ 3 = 6 socks. These 6 socks were dressed in white and put back. So, there are now 6 white socks and 12 red socks remaining.

Then, 18 new red socks were added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 red socks.

Now, let's count the non-red rubber socks: 6 white socks.

And the non-white rubber socks: 30 red socks.

To find the difference, subtract the non-white socks from the non-red socks: 30 - 6 = 24.

So, on Sunday afternoon, there are 24 more non-red rubber socks than non-white rubber socks.

195	The cost of a pencil is as high as that of a pencil and a piece of paper. A pencil is $1.20 and a piece of paper is $0.30. How much would eight pencils cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: ""The cost of a pencil is as high as that of a pencil and a piece of paper"" means 1 pencil = 1 pencil + 1 paper. So, 1 pencil = $1.20, and 1 pencil + 1 paper = $1.20. That means 1 paper = $1.20 - $1.20 = $0.30.

Now, let's find the cost of 8 pencils: 8 pencils = 8 x $1.20 = $9.60.

 Month 3: She collects 20 smaller cards. Total: 80 + 20 = 100 cards.
 Month 4: She collects 2 times the cards from Month 1 and 2. That's 2 x (20 + 60) = 160 more cards. Total: 100 + 160 = 260 cards.

Let's break it down:

Mark writes 1,000 words per week, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per word. So, Mark earns:

1,000 words/week × 5 cents/word = 5,000 cents/week from Publisher A

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Mark earns:

5,000 cents/week × 2 = 10,000 cents/week from Publisher B

In total, Mark makes:

5,000 cents/week + 10,000 cents/week = 15,000 cents/week

201	John received a prize in the office. That prize consisted of 1 coin at a time when the prize amount was $5000 and the prize was increased by 5%. If he made 2000 coins, every coin in the year and received the prize on the first day of the year, how much money did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

$5000 + $250 = $5250

John made 2000 coins, and each coin is worth $5250 / 2000 = $2.625

So, John earned:
2000 coins x $2.625 per coin = $5250

Plus the prize money:
$5250 + $5250 = $10,500

John earned $10,500 that year!

He eats a cheese and egg omelet for breakfast 3 times a week, and uses one omelet more than he eats a loaf of bread. He made a large macaroni and cheese dish that he could eat on many nights a week, and he made it with 8 cheeses. How many chopped dishes did he use?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

* He eats bread every day at noon, so that's 7 loaves of bread per week.
* He eats a cheese and egg omelet for breakfast 3 times a week, and uses one omelet more than he eats a loaf of bread. So, he eats 3 + 1 = 4 omelets per week.
* He made a large macaroni and cheese dish with 8 cheeses.

In total, he used 7 loaves of bread, 4 omelets, and 1 macaroni dish. That's a total of 7 + 4 + 1 = 12 dishes.

Adding these to her previous total, Janet now has 32 + 36 = 68 pencils.

The 2 bags with more red pencils didn't specify the number of pencils, so we can't add those to the total. But we know Janet has at least 68 pencils now.

To get an average score of 93, Brinley needs a total score of:
93 x 6 = 558

Since he already has 438 points, he needs:

206	Michael also enjoys horseback riding. He used to ride it about 5 times a week, covering 25 miles each time. He did this for four weeks, and then he decided to ride only 2 horses a week, but it was 60 miles each, and he did it every week. How many miles did Michael cover in total?	860	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Weeks 1-4: 5 times/week × 25 miles/time = 125 miles/week. For 4 weeks, that's 125 miles/week × 4 weeks = 500 miles.

Then, he rode 2 times/week × 60 miles/time = 120 miles/week. Since we don't know the number of weeks, let's call it x. So, 120 miles/week × x weeks = 120x miles.

Total miles = 500 miles + 120x miles.

To find the total miles, we need to know the number of weeks he rode 2 times a week. Unfortunately, that information is not provided. If you can give me that, I can give you the total miles.

If Sarah saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many walks in the woods would she have to make before she could afford the bed and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sara wants to buy a bed for $30 and a pair of shoes for $20 x 2 = $40. In total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70.

She already has $10 saved up.

Her nanny pays her $5 x 4 = $20 for babysitting.

So, Sara has $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Her parents pay her $4 for every walk in the woods. To find out how many walks she needs to make, we divide $40 by $4:

$40 ÷ $4 = 10

Sara needs to make 10 walks in the woods to afford the bed and shoes.

211	Jerry had many chickens. The red chickens laid 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens laid 5 eggs a day. Jerry collected 42 eggs a day. If he had two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens did he have?	4	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem in isiZulu, a beautiful African language.

Let's say Jerry had x red chickens. Since he had two more white chickens than red chickens, he had x + 2 white chickens.

The red chickens laid 3 eggs a day, so the total eggs from red chickens are 3x.

The white chickens laid 5 eggs a day, so the total eggs from white chickens are 5(x + 2).

The total eggs collected per day are 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry had 4 red chickens. Ngiyabonga for asking!"	4
212	Gary enjoys walking along the edge of the roller coaster, which is a rectangular walk measuring one and a half square miles [1.5 sq km] and 6 cubits [6.4 sq mi] in diameter. If he walks 3 cubits in one hour, how many hours does it take him to walk?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* The rectangular walk measures 1.5 sq km x 6.4 sq mi = 9.6 sq km (since 1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km)
* The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Since it's a rectangle, the diameter is the diagonal, which is √(l² + w²). Given the diameter is 6.4 sq mi, we can set up the equation:
√(l² + w²) = 6.4 sq mi
* Solving for l and w, we get l ≈ 2.55 km and w ≈ 1.87 km
* Now, the perimeter is 2(2.55 + 1.87) ≈ 14.84 km
* Gary walks 3 cubits (approximately 1.39 km) per hour. To find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter, we divide the perimeter by his speed:
14.84 km ÷ 1.39 km/h ≈ 10.67 hours

So, it would take Gary approximately 10 hours and 40 minutes to walk the perimeter of the roller coaster."	40

214	Jerry has two lakes that each release 4 gallons of water per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big lake had twice as much water as the small lake. Now the big lake has four times as much water as the small lake. How much water does the small lake have now?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Lake esikhulu (big lake) inemali yamanzi amaningi kakhulu kunalake esincane (small lake). Manje, lake esincane inemali yamanzi engama-4 gallons per minute. Ngoku-4 iminithi edlule, lake esikhulu inemali yamanzi eyi-2 times lake esincane. Manje, lake esikhulu inemali yamanzi eyi-4 times lake esincane.

Let's use algebra:

Let x be the amount of water in the small lake 4 minutes ago.

The big lake had 2x water 4 minutes ago.

In 4 minutes, each lake adds 4 gallons/minute × 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the small lake now has x + 16 gallons.

The big lake now has 2x + 16 gallons.

Since the big lake now has 4 times the water of the small lake:

2x + 16 = 4(x + 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 16 = 4x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

16 = 2x + 64

Subtracting 64 from both sides:

-48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small lake had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now it has:

24 + 16 = 40 gallons

Kusho ukuthi lake esincane inemali yamanzi engama-40 gallons manje! (That means the small lake has 40 gallons of water now!)"	40

Janeth asks for $2,000 and promises to pay 10% more, so she'll get:
$2,000 + (10% of $2,000) = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

If she loses $165 a month for 12 months, she'll lose a total of:
$165 x 12 = $1,980

To find her remaining salary, subtract the loss from the initial amount:
$2,200 - $1,980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining salary would be $220.

Siyabonga (thank you) for asking!"	220
217	You have 4 flowers on a blue flower. There are 7 more dahlias on the flower than on the blue flower. How many flowers are there on the blue flower?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem together. If there are 7 more dahlias on the flower than on the blue flower, and there are 4 flowers on the blue flower, we can set up an equation:

Number of flowers on the flower = Number of flowers on the blue flower + 7
Let's say the number of flowers on the blue flower is x. Then, the equation becomes:

x + 7 = x + 4

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

7 = 4

So, the number of flowers on the blue flower is 4.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlayiya ezine eziluhlaza kwi-flower, kunezinhlayiya ezine eziluhlaza ku-blue flower."" (There are 4 flowers on the flower, and there are 4 flowers on the blue flower.)"	4
218	Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. If Harriet is 21 now, imagine the ages of the three in three years.	45	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!)

Let's break it down:

Harriet is 21 now.
Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is 21 x 2 = 42 now.
Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 21 x 3 = 63 now.

In three years:
Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24.
Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45.
Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66.

219	Four students scored 251 points in a game. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 78 + 85 = 231 points.

The four students scored a total of 251 points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three from the total:

251 - 231 = 20 points.

Jojo scored 20 points!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	20
220	It takes Carmen 10 minutes to play an orange and 5 minutes to play a sudoku. Over the weekend, she played 3 orange and 8 sudoku. How long did it take her to play that game?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the time it took Carmen to play the games:

3 oranges × 10 minutes = 30 minutes
8 sudokus × 5 minutes = 40 minutes
Total time = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	70
221	Celine poured 90 liters of water from the reservoir into her little toilet and then managed to collect twice the amount of rain that was left over. How many liters of water are in the reservoir now?	90	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down step by step:

Celine poured 90 liters of water from the reservoir into her toilet. That means the reservoir now has 90 liters less.

Then, she collected twice the amount of rain that was left over. This implies that the amount of rain collected is equal to the amount of water left in the reservoir, multiplied by 2.

Let x be the amount of water left in the reservoir after Celine poured 90 liters into her toilet. Then, the amount of rain collected is 2x.

We know that the total amount of water in the reservoir is equal to the initial amount minus 90 liters, plus the amount of rain collected:

Initial amount - 90 + 2x = Initial amount

Since Celine collected twice the amount of rain that was left over, we can set up the equation:

x = Initial amount - 90

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

Initial amount - 90 + 2(Initial amount - 90) = Initial amount

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Initial amount = 180

So, the reservoir initially had 180 liters of water. After Celine poured 90 liters into her toilet, the reservoir had:

180 - 90 = 90 liters

Then, she collected twice the amount of rain that was left over, which is:

2 × 90 = 180 liters

Now, the reservoir has the initial 90 liters, plus the 180 liters of rain collected:

90 + 180 = 270 liters

Ndi ofuma! (That's ""We've calculated!"" in Igbo.) The reservoir now has 270 liters of water."	270
222	Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias, which are smaller than geranium trees. How many flowers does he plant?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

223	A company spends $15,000 on advertising in one year, and then spends a third of that amount in another year. In two years, how much did the company spend on advertising?	20000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

A third of $15,000 is $5,000. So, in the first year, the company spent $15,000, and in the second year, it spent $5,000. In total, the company spent $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

Carlos uyaphi i-$30 ngosuku olulodwa, kanti uBenji uyaphi i-$18 ngosuku olulodwa. Uma uCarlos usebenza amahora athathu, uyophakela i-$30 * 3 = i-$90. Uma uBenji usebenza amahora ayisihlanu, uyophakela i-$18 * 5 = i-$90. (Carlos pays $30 an hour, and Benji pays $18 an hour. If Carlos works 3 hours, he pays $30 * 3 = $90. If Benji works 5 hours, he pays $18 * 5 = $90.)

227	The burrito costs $6.50. She adds the pasta, which costs $2.00, the cheese, which costs $1.00, the avocado, which costs $1.00, and two side dishes, which cost $0.25 each. She plans to make her meal more than $3.00 worth of chips and wine. If she had a $5.00 gift card, she could afford it. How much does she still owe?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Burrito: $6.50
Pasta: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 side dishes: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Chips and wine: more than $3.00, let's assume $3.00
Total: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

She has a $5.00 gift card, so she still owes:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

228	Kalinda and her mother were doing the same work as a 360-degree telescope. Kalinda could add 4 fractions of a minute to each. Her mother could add the number that Kalinda could add in a minute. How many hours would it take them to complete these questions?	1	"Nzuri sana! (Very good!) Let's break it down.

Kalinda adds 4 fractions of a minute, which means she adds 4/60 = 1/15 of an hour per hour.

Her mother adds the same amount Kalinda adds in a minute, which is 4/60 = 1/15 of an hour per hour, just like Kalinda.

Together, they add 1/15 + 1/15 = 2/15 of an hour per hour.

To find the time it takes to complete the work, we can set up the equation:

Work = Rate × Time
1 (whole work) = (2/15) × Time

To solve for Time, we can multiply both sides by 15/2:

Time = 1 × (15/2) = 15/2 hours
Time = 7.5 hours

So, it would take Kalinda and her mother 7.5 hours to complete the work. Mzuri! (Good!)"	7
229	Ashlyn went to the field two months later and found that 30% of the apples were ready for harvest, so she brought them home. When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the apples were ready, so she harvested the apples. After two weeks, how many apples would be harvested?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the apples ready for harvest. This means 70% were not ready.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the apples were ready. To find the percentage, we can convert the fraction to a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.75 × 100 = 75%.

Now, let's find the percentage of apples that became ready in those two weeks: 75% - 30% = 45%.

This means 45% of the apples became ready in those two weeks. Since Ashlyn harvested all the ready apples, she would harvest 75% of the total apples.

In Zulu, we would say: ""Kwakuthiwa amapheni angu-75% ayotholakala emtholampilo!"" (It means 75% of the apples were harvested!)

I hope that helps, my friend!"	75
230	Mark bought 12 of them for his company. They sold for $20,000 each. He paid 10% of the sales tax and $1000 for each title. How much did he pay for all of them?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark bought 12 items at $20,000 each, so the total cost is:
12 x $20,000 = $240,000

He paid 10% sales tax, which is:
$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

And he paid $1,000 for each title, so that's:
12 x $1,000 = $12,000

Adding it all up, Mark paid:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

233	Thirty-three penguins were burned in the snow. One-third of them jumped in and drowned in the oil. One-third returned to the cave to feed. How many penguins still sunbathe?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* One-third of 33 penguins jumped in and drowned in the oil, which is 33 ÷ 3 = 11 penguins.
* One-third of 33 penguins returned to the cave to feed, which is also 33 ÷ 3 = 11 penguins.

That means 11 + 11 = 22 penguins are no longer sunbathing.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, subtract 22 from the original 33: 33 - 22 = 11.

So, 11 penguins still sunbathe.

Let's break this down. Steve eats 6 chickpeas a day, but he eats twice as much as his predecessor. So, his predecessor eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 chickpeas a day.

Since a vine can produce 3 chickpeas a day, Steve's predecessor only needs 1 vine. But Steve eats twice as much, so he needs 2 vines.

239	The hall had three entrances, A, B, and C, which extended to the east. At the end of a class, 30% of the students left the hall via A, 3/5 went via B, and the rest went via C, depending on the number of students leaving via C.	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

To find the value of x, we need to find the remaining percentage after 30% and 3/5.

3/5 = 0.6 ( converted to a decimal)

So, 0.6 = 60%

Adding 30% and 60%, we get 90%. That means 10% of the students left via C.

Therefore, x = 10%."	10
240	James has six times as much sugar as Robert. John has twice as much sugar as Robert. If John has fifty-four sugars, how many sugars does John have more than James?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 54 sugars and has twice as much sugar as Robert, so Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 sugars.

James has six times as much sugar as Robert, so James has 27 × 6 = 162 sugars.

Now, let's find out how many sugars John has more than James: 162 - 54 = 108.

So, John has 108 sugars less than James. To get the correct answer, we need to subtract: 108 - (-108) = 216.

John has 216 sugars less than James, not more. I hope that makes sense, my friend!

Let's break it down:

Mike sends 2 letters/week to each of 5 people, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 letters/week.

Each letter has 5 pages, so that's 10 letters x 5 pages/letter = 50 pages/week.

Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, so to write 50 pages, it'll take him 50 pages x 6 minutes/page = 300 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours/week writing.

244	Griffin had twenty-four French fries, but Kyle took five of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.

If Griffin got twenty-seven fries in the end, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 x 2 = 10. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9.
Ginger gave Griffin some fries, let's call it x. So Griffin now has 9 + x.
Colby took a small portion, but we don't know how many, so let's move on.
Kyle took 3 more from Griffin, leaving him with (9 + x) - 3 = 6 + x.
In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we set up the equation: 6 + x = 27.
Solving for x, we get x = 21.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 21 fries!"	21
245	There are six fish in one well, and two fish in another well. The difference between the number of fish in the two wells is twice the number of fish in the two wells. If the two wells have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each?	7	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Well 1 has 6 fish, and Well 2 has 2 fish. The difference between them is 6 - 2 = 4.

The problem states that the difference (4) is twice the number of fish in both wells. So, if we call the number of fish in both wells ""x"", we can set up the equation:

4 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 4/2
x = 2

Since both wells have the same number of fish, each well has 2 fish.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Kubili kwaba izihlahla zesixhenxe esisodwa."" (Both wells have two fish each.)"	2
246	Jeans, a celebrity therapist, earns $250 per hour. She wanted to do a very expensive set for a film in which she played a character that would take six hours to shoot every day and needed to be shot every four weeks. The film would take five weeks to complete. After the film was finished, the celebrity photographer gave Jean a ten percent bonus for the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!

Let's break it down:

Jean earns $250 per hour.
She works 6 hours a day, so that's $250 x 6 = $1500 per day.
She works every 4 weeks, which means she works 5 days in 4 weeks (since the film takes 5 weeks to complete).
So, she earns $1500 x 5 = $7500 every 4 weeks.
Since the film takes 5 weeks, she earns $7500 x 5/4 = $9375.
The photographer gives her a 10% bonus, which is $9375 x 0.1 = $937.50.
Adding the bonus to her total earnings, Jean earns $9375 + $937.50 = $10,312.50.

If a cat has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?	5,600	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, Sue's sister ate x calories. Sue ate 4x calories.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 5x calories. Then, she ate 13 times as much, which is 13(5x) = 65x calories.

Since Sue ate twice as much as her sister on Monday, Sue ate 2x calories on Monday.

Now, let's find the difference between Sue's calories and her sister's calories on Monday and Tuesday:

Sue's calories on Monday and Tuesday = 4x + 2x = 6x
Sister's calories on Monday and Tuesday = x + 65x = 66x

The difference is 66x - 6x = 60x.

A cat has 200 calories, so we can set up the equation:

60x = 200

Divide both sides by 60:

x = 200/60 = 10/3

Now, we can find the difference in calories:

60x = 60(10/3) = 200 calories

So, Sue ate 200 calories more than her sister.
