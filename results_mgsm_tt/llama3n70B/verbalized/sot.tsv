0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three at breakfast and then bakes four muffins for her friends each day. She sells the rest at the farm market for $2 a fresh egg a day. How much does she make in dollars a day at the farm market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the eggs: 16 eggs - 3 eggs (breakfast) = 13 eggs. Then, 13 eggs - 4 eggs (muffins) = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes: 9 eggs x $2 = $18 a day at the farm market.

2	Josh decides to change the house. He buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in renovations. This has increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit has he made?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit:

Initial investment = $80,000 (buying the house) + $50,000 (renovations) = $130,000

The house's value increased by 150%, so the new value is:
$130,000 x 2.5 (1 + 1.5) = $325,000

Profit = New value - Initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

4	Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of chicken food, with nuts, algae, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She gives the chickens three different meals. In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of food. In the evening, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to feed her chickens for the last time if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food, and she has 20 chickens. So, she needs 20 x 3 = 60 cups of food in total.

She already gave 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the evening, which is a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups she needs for the last time, we subtract the total cups already given from the total cups needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of food to feed her chickens for the last time.

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle all have?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep.

In total, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

7	Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Usually she can download 2 GB per minute, but 40% of the download is complete. Windows forces a restart to update, which takes 20 minutes. Now Carla has to start the download from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo yakho! (I'm happy to help you with that!)

Let's break it down:

Carla had already downloaded 40% of the 200 GB file, which is:
200 GB x 0.4 = 80 GB

But she has to start from scratch, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB file.

Her download speed is 2 GB per minute, so to download 200 GB, it'll take:
200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, she lost 20 minutes due to the Windows update, so we add that to the total time:
100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it'll take Carla 120 minutes to download the entire file.

8	John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph and turns back when he realizes that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends 2 hours in stopped traffic. He spends another half hour driving at 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 mph. How far is he home after 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down John's journey:

1. He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. He turns back and tries to get home in 4 hours, but spends 2 hours in stopped traffic, so he doesn't move for 2 hours. Then, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

3. He still has 3.5 hours left to drive, and he drives at 80 mph for the remaining 4 hours. Since he has already driven for 0.5 hours, he has 3 hours left. He covers:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 3 hours = 240 miles

Now, let's find the total distance he has traveled:
Total Distance = 180 miles (initial drive) + 15 miles (half-hour drive) + 240 miles (final drive) = 435 miles

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled a total distance of 435 miles, he is now:
435 miles - 180 miles = 255 miles away from home.

After 4 hours, John is 255 miles away from home.

10	The new app had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many total downloads did the app have in three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In the first month, there were 60 downloads.
In the second month, there were 3 x 60 = 180 downloads.
In the third month, there were 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastries. She bought 3 tins of doughnuts for $68 each. 2 tins of cupcakes for $80 each, and 6 tins of cheesecakes for $55 each. What was the total price?	694	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total price:

3 tins of doughnuts = 3 x $68 = $204
2 tins of cupcakes = 2 x $80 = $160
6 tins of cheesecakes = 6 x $55 = $330

Total price = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will produce seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each. It costs $3 a year to plant and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial cost: $90
Yearly profit: 7 lemons × $1.50 = $10.50
Yearly cost: $3
Yearly net profit: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

To find out how many years it'll take to break even:
$90 (initial cost) ÷ $7.50 (yearly net profit) = 12 years

So, it'll take Carlos 12 years before he starts making money from the lemon tree.

13	Melanie is a traveling saleswoman. She sold her third vacuum to the green house, two more to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. If Melanie has any vacuums left, how many did she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi Melanie wayengena kangaki? (Let me help you figure out how many vacuums Melanie had initially?)

Melanie sold her third vacuum to the green house, so she had 2 left.

Then, she sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 0.

But wait, she still had some left, because she sold half of what was left to the orange house. This means she had an even number of vacuums left after selling to the red house.

Let's work backward:

* She sold half of what was left to the orange house, so she must have had an even number, say 2x.
* Before selling to the orange house, she had 2x.
* Before selling to the red house, she had 2x + 2.
* Initially, she had 2x + 2 + 1 (because she sold her third vacuum to the green house).

The smallest even number that satisfies this equation is x = 2. Therefore, Melanie had 2x + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 vacuums initially.

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining 25% are enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest are enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

25% of 20 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 x 20 = 5 students.

To find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, subtract the number of students in contemporary and jazz from the total:

20 - 4 - 5 = 11 students

Now, to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

(11 / 20) x 100% = 55%

So, 55% of all students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

15	The seller wants to make a choice between 2 purchase strategies: jewelry priced at $5,000 or electrical appliances priced at $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while electrical appliances will go up 1.2% that month. If the seller wants to make a total profit at the end of the month by making a choice, what will this profit be?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry priced at $5,000
Profit = Principal x Rate of return
= $5,000 x 2.5%
= $5,000 x 0.025
= $125

Option 2: Electrical appliances priced at $8,000
Profit = Principal x Rate of return
= $8,000 x 1.2%
= $8,000 x 0.012
= $96

To make a total profit, the seller should choose the jewelry option, which will give a profit of $125.

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher, and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Ehe, ngiwa kuwe! (Ah, I've got it for you!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, Jill earns $20/hour and works 35 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
$20/hour × 35 hours/week = $700/week

As a coach, Jill earns $30/hour and works 15 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a coach are:
$30/hour × 15 hours/week = $450/week

Her total weekly earnings are:
$700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
$1150/week × 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

In Yoruba, we say: ""Owo yi po ju $57,500 lo!"" (This money is up to $57,500!)"	57500
18	Claire makes an omelet of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. How many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ok, let's do the math. Claire eats 3 eggs every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs. In 4 weeks, she eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs. Now, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 84 eggs is 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."	4
19	It took Marissa one hour to cover the first four miles, and another hour to cover the next two. If she wanted her speed to be four miles per hour, how much speed (in miles per hour) would she need to cover the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxowo yakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

Marissa covered 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 4 miles/hour.
Then, she covered 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 2 miles/hour.

To find her average speed, we need to find the total distance and total time. The total distance is 4 + 2 = 6 miles. The total time is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Her average speed is total distance ÷ total time = 6 miles ÷ 2 hours = 3 miles/hour.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles/hour, she needs to cover the remaining distance at a speed that will give her an overall average speed of 4 miles/hour.

Let's call the remaining distance ""x"" miles. The total distance will be 6 + x miles. The total time will be 2 hours + the time to cover the remaining distance.

We can set up the equation: (6 + x) miles ÷ (2 hours + time to cover x miles) = 4 miles/hour.

To solve for the speed needed to cover the remaining distance, we need to know the remaining distance. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide that information. However, we can express the required speed in terms of x.

Let's say the time to cover the remaining distance is ""t"" hours. Then, the equation becomes:

(6 + x) miles ÷ (2 + t) hours = 4 miles/hour.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by (2 + t) hours:

6 + x = 4(2 + t)
6 + x = 8 + 4t
x - 2 = 4t
t = (x - 2) / 4

Now, we can find the speed needed to cover the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance ÷ Time = x miles ÷ ((x - 2) / 4) hours = 4x / (x - 2) miles/hour.

So, Marissa needs to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 4x / (x - 2) miles/hour to achieve an overall average speed of 4 miles/hour.

20	I have 10 gallons of orange juice two thirds of water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice one third of water. But when I pour it, I'm pouring out one gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

You have 10 gallons of orange juice with 2/3 water, which means you have 10 x 2/3 = 6.67 gallons of water in the orange juice.

You want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice with 1/3 water, which means you have 15 x 1/3 = 5 gallons of water in the pineapple juice.

When you pour the orange juice, you're pouring out 1 gallon, so you're left with 10 - 1 = 9 gallons of orange juice. The amount of water in the orange juice remains the same, which is 6.67 gallons.

Now, let's combine the two juices. You have 9 gallons of orange juice with 6.67 gallons of water and 15 gallons of pineapple juice with 5 gallons of water. In total, you have 9 + 15 = 24 gallons of juice with 6.67 + 5 = 11.67 gallons of water.

So, my friend, there are 11.67 gallons of water left in the 24 gallons of juice.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. This is a 25% discount from the actual price. What was the actual price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the actual price of the book.

If the discount is 25%, that means Kyle paid 75% of the actual price.

Let the actual price be x.

Then, 0.75x = 19.50

To find x, divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 ÷ 0.75
x = 26.00

So, the actual price of the book is $26.00.

* 4 apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total expenses so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie had $50 in total, so she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on boxes of pizzas.

Since each box costs $8.50, Marie bought: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizzas.

29	Gloria buys shoes when she meets a pair of boots that fit her shoe size. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high-heeled shoes that each cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

One pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33. The other costs twice as much, so that's 2 x $33 = $66.

Both pairs of high-heeled shoes cost $5 less than the boots. Let's call the cost of the boots ""x"".

Then, we can set up the equations:

$x - 5 = $33
$x - 5 = $66

Solving for x, we get:

$x = $33 + 5 = $38
$x = $66 + 5 = $71

Since both equations should give us the same answer, we can conclude that the boots cost $71.

30	If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, add Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down. If Darrell's and Allen's ages add up to 162, that means:

Darrell's age + Allen's age = 162

Let's assume Darrell's age is D and Allen's age is A. Then:

D + A = 162

Now, if we add 10 years to Allen's age, we get:

A + 10

To find the answer, we need to know Allen's current age. Let's assume Allen is x years old. Then:

x + 10 =?

Since D + A = 162, we can set up an equation:

D + x = 162

We can't find the exact value of x without more information, but we can express the answer in terms of x:

x + 10 = 172 - D

31	Gunter tries to count the sweets in the container. He asks his friends how many they think are in the container. One says 80. Another says 20 more than the first half. A third says 25% more than the first half. What are their estimates?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 80 ÷ 2 = 40, so 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 80 ÷ 2 = 40, so 40 + (25% of 40) = 40 + 10 = 50.

So, their estimates are 80, 60, and 50.

Let's break it down:

Raymond has 40 gems.
Half of Raymond's gems is 40 ÷ 2 = 20.
Aaron has 5 more gems than half of Raymond's, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 gems.
Siobhan has 2 fewer gems than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 gems.

So, Siobhan has 23 gems. Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!)"	23

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points, which means he scores 4 + (4 x 0.25) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

In total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. There are still 4 yogurts on sale for $5. How much do you spend on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of yogurt for 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, Terry will eat:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since there are 4 yogurts on sale for $5, we need to find out how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry will need:
60 yogurts ÷ 4 yogurts/pack = 15 packs

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
15 packs × $5/pack = $75

So, you will spend $75 on yogurt in 30 days.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	30
37	John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has a set of 13 Legos and sold them for $15 each. He ended up buying 8 video games for $20 each and was left with $5. How many sets of Legos does he still have?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

John sold 13 Legos for $15 each, so he got 13 x $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $195 - $160 = $35 left, but he was left with $5, so he must have spent the remaining $35 - $5 = $30.

Since each Lego set costs $15, he must have bought $30 / $15 = 2 Lego sets.

So, John has 2 Lego sets left."	2
38	John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs for 3 hours the first day and a half as he runs for 2 days. How fast does he run?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. So, he runs a total of 60 miles in 3 days.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the next 2 days, he runs half as much, which means he runs for 1.5 hours each day. In total, he runs for 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate his speed:

Speed = Total distance ÷ Total time
= 60 miles ÷ 6 hours
= 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"	10
39	A person can run at a pace that is four times faster than walking, but he can jump at a pace that is half as fast as running. If he jumps at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can he travel in six hours if he spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

If he jumps at 3 miles per hour, and jumping is half as fast as running, then running is 2 times 3 miles per hour, which is 6 miles per hour.

If running is 4 times faster than walking, then walking is 6 miles per hour divided by 4, which is 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in 6 hours. He spends one third of the time running, which is 2 hours, and two thirds of the time walking, which is 4 hours.

Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour x 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour x 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

So, my friend, he can travel 18 miles in six hours.

42	Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the breakfast lunch. She slices each pie into 8 pieces and puts five pies on the table for the guests to enjoy. At the end of the night, after the guests took and ate the pie pieces, there were 14 pie pieces left. How many pie pieces were taken by the guests?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie has 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pie pieces in total.

After the guests ate, there were 14 pie pieces left, so the number of pie pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26.

43	According to nutritional information, a bag of crisps has 250 calories per bag. If a 300-gram bag has 5 nutrients, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. You've already eaten 1800 calories, and your daily limit is 2000 calories. That means you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since one bag of crisps has 250 calories, you can eat a portion that's equivalent to 200 calories. To find out how many grams that is, you can divide 200 by 250, then multiply by 300 (the weight of one bag).

(200 ÷ 250) × 300 = 240 grams

So, you can eat 240 grams of crisps, my friend! Ukudla kwethu! (Enjoy your food!)"	240

45	Meredith is a freelance writer who writes about life topics and sends them out to clients every day as part of her full-time job. A writer's diary takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 diaries on Monday and 2/5 times as many diaries on Tuesday as she did on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many diaries as she wrote on Tuesday. Total the number of hours she spent writing diaries in the last three days.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 diaries, which took 5 x 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times as many diaries as Monday, so 2/5 x 5 = 2 diaries. That's 2 x 4 = 8 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many diaries as Tuesday, so 2 x 2 = 4 diaries. That's 4 x 4 = 16 hours.

Total hours spent writing diaries in the last three days is 20 + 8 + 16 = 44 hours.

46	Candice put the sticky notes in her purse before going to her job at the coffee shop. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a pack of sticky notes. At work, she put one sticky note in every 220 different cups of coffee. If she had 23 sticky notes left, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?	163	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Candice wayenza kanjani? (Let me calculate how Candice did it.)

Candice used 1 sticky note for every 220 cups of coffee, and she had 23 sticky notes left. That means she used a total of x - 23 sticky notes, where x is the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought.

Since she used 1 sticky note for every 220 cups of coffee, the number of sticky notes she used is equal to the number of cups of coffee divided by 220. Let's call the number of cups of coffee ""y"". Then, the number of sticky notes she used is y / 220.

We know that the number of sticky notes she used is x - 23, so we can set up the equation:

y / 220 = x - 23

We're told that y = 220, so we can substitute that into the equation:

220 / 220 = x - 23

1 = x - 23

x = 24

So, Candice bought a pack of 24 sticky notes!

47	John buys twice as many red tiles as blue tiles. Red tiles cost 50% more than blue tiles. He spends $200 on blue tiles that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the tiles?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spends $200 on blue tiles that cost $40 each, so he buys:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue tiles

Since he buys twice as many red tiles as blue tiles, he buys:

2 × 5 = 10 red tiles

Red tiles cost 50% more than blue tiles, so each red tile costs:

$40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

He spends on red tiles:

10 red tiles × $60 = $600

In total, John spends:

$200 (blue tiles) + $600 (red tiles) = $800

Let's break it down:

15 floors x 8 units per floor = 120 units in total

3/4 of the building is occupied, so 1/4 is unoccupied.

(Translation: Because Lloyd collects 252 eggs a day, that means the dozen collection is 252/12 = 21. The dozen collection is multiplied by the dozen price, so 21 x $2 = $42 a day. If it's a day, then the weekly collection is $42 x 7 = $294.)"	294
51	Tom's boat can go 10 miles per hour. He swims from 1 to 4PM. Then he turns back at a rate of 6 mph. How long does it take to turn back?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. At a rate of 10 mph, he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mph x 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, he turns back at a rate of 6 mph. To find the time it takes to turn back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to turn back.

52	Uriah's book bag swells up to him. He needs to remove 15 kilograms of it. His comic books weigh 1/4 of a pound and his toys weigh 1/2 kilogram of each toy. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Uriah needs to remove 15 kilograms from his book bag.

First, let's convert the weight of the comic books from pounds to kilograms. 1 pound is equal to 0.45 kilograms, so:

1/4 pound = 0.25 pounds = 0.25 x 0.45 = 0.1125 kilograms per comic book

If he removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed is:

30 x 0.1125 = 3.375 kilograms

Now, he still needs to remove 15 - 3.375 = 11.625 kilograms.

Each toy weighs 1/2 kilogram, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

11.625 ÷ 0.5 = 23.25 toys

Since you can't remove a fraction of a toy, he needs to remove 23 toys.

53	The repairman charges different prices to repair truck and automobile tires. For each truck tire repaired, the repairman will charge $60 and for each automobile tire repaired, the repairman will charge $40. On Thursday, the repairman repaired 6 truck tires and 4 automobile tires. On Friday, the repairman repaired 12 automobile tires and did not repair the truck tires. How much additional profit did the repairman make with the higher profit?	40	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

On Thursday, the repairman repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, so that's 6 x $60 = $360. He also repaired 4 automobile tires at $40 each, so that's 4 x $40 = $160. Total profit on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the repairman repaired 12 automobile tires at $40 each, so that's 12 x $40 = $480.

Now, let's find the additional profit made with the higher profit (truck tires). On Thursday, the profit from truck tires was $360. If the repairman had repaired 6 automobile tires instead, the profit would have been 6 x $40 = $240. So, the additional profit made with the higher profit (truck tires) is $360 - $240 = $120.

In isiZulu, ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!) The answer is $120."	120

62	If Marcy works for the same firm for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of R50,000 per year. Starting after 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukubonga ukuthola umbuzo wakho. (I'd be happy to help you with your question.)

Let's break it down:

After 20 years, Marcy is entitled to 5% of the pension value per year. That means she gets 5% of R50,000 = R2,500 per year.

Since she quits after 30 years, she gets 10 years of this additional pension (30 - 20 = 10). So, her total additional pension is R2,500 x 10 = R25,000.

Now, add this to her original annual pension of R50,000. Her new annual pension will be R50,000 + R25,000 = R75,000.

So, her annual pension will be R75,000.

63	Aleena subscribes to a streaming service that costs her $140 a month. If the streaming company charged her that price in the first half of the year and charged her less than 10% in the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.	1596	"Jambo! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140/month, so she paid a total of:
$140/month × 6 months = $840

In the second half of the year, the company charged her less than 10%, so let's calculate the discount:
10% of $140 = $14
New price = $140 - $14 = $126/month

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $126/month, so she paid a total of:
$126/month × 6 months = $756

Now, let's add the amounts she paid in both halves of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1,596

So, Aleena paid a total of $1,596 for the streaming service at the end of the year.

64	Sophia is thinking about taking a road trip in her car, and she wants to know how far she can drive with one tank of gasoline. She has traveled 100 miles from her first tank, and needed to cross 4 liters of gasoline to refill it. Her car's manual says her tank holds 12 liters of gasoline. How many miles can Sophia drive with one tank of gasoline?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sophia traveled 100 miles with 4 liters of gasoline. To find out how many miles she can drive with 1 liter, we divide 100 miles by 4 liters:

100 miles ÷ 4 liters = 25 miles per liter

Since her tank holds 12 liters, we multiply the miles per liter by 12:

25 miles/liter × 12 liters = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles with one tank of gasoline!

Ngiyabonga ukubonga! (Thank you for asking!)"	300
65	Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and decides to go to bed and read for half an hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 0.5 hours reading, making it a total of 2.5 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so it's 2.5 hours/day × 3 days/week = 7.5 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, he'll spend 7.5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 30 hours.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	30
66	There are four schools competing in the basketball tournament. Each school sends a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team and each team has 5 players. Each school has sent a coach for each team. In all, how many people have the schools sent?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

69	Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then he receives a share of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if he has a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?	60	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxube! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

Bailey receives $5 for 8 weeks, so he receives a total of $5 x 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, he has a total of $100. To find out how much he started with, we subtract the amount he received from the total:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Bailey uqale ngama-60!"" (Bailey started with 60!)"	60

Let's calculate Judy's weekly earnings:

Regular weekly classes: 5 classes × 15 students × $5.00 = $375.00
Saturday classes: 8 classes × 15 students × $5.00 = $600.00
Total weekly earnings: $375.00 + $600.00 = $975.00

Judy makes $975.00 in one week.

73	Sheila bought five cell phones for R150 each with a three-month installment. 2% interest will be paid for each unit. How much will Sheila pay per month for three months?	255	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Izinhlobo zesikhathi sesithathu (Three months installment)
Amaphonini ayisihlanu (Five cell phones)
Inani leyi-R150 (Each costs R150)

Ukuthenga (Total cost) = 5 x R150 = R750

Ukubonga (Interest) = 2% of R750 = R15
Ukuthenga okubonga (Total with interest) = R750 + R15 = R765

Ukuthenga ngomzuzu (Monthly payment) = R765 ÷ 3 = R255

Sheila will pay R255 per month for three months.

74	Artie has a flower stand at the Farmer's Market. He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 a pot, petunias for $1.87 a pot, and begonias for $2.12 a pot. Artie doesn't have any cash back today, so he's decided to round up all of his purchases to close to the dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make in total?	88	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Artie will make:

Marigolds: 12 pots x $3 (rounded up from $2.74) = $36
Petunias: 9 pots x $2 (rounded up from $1.87) = $18
Begonias: 17 pots x $2 (rounded up from $2.12) = $34

Total amount: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make a total of $88. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	88
75	Luke spends time on the beach building castles. He eventually realizes that each level of the castle will be half the size of the rectangle as the level below it. If he builds a 4-level castle where the top level has 16 rectangles, what is the average height of the rectangle?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Since each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way up.

Level 1 (bottom): 16 x 2 = 32 rectangles
Level 2: 32 x 2 = 64 rectangles
Level 3: 64 x 2 = 128 rectangles
Level 4 (base): 128 x 2 = 256 rectangles

Now, let's find the average height. We add up the rectangles at each level: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. Then, we divide by the number of levels: 240 ÷ 4 = 60.

So, the average height of the rectangle is 60.

76	Cecilia has just bought a puppy. According to the vet, she should feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food this season for the first 180 days. Then she should feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food regularly for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food has 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Odiyɛn na ɛyɛ dɛn? (How can I help you?)

Ah, Cecilia and her new puppy!

Let's break it down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup/day, so that's 180 cups.

After that, she needs 2 cups/day. There are 365 days in a year, so for the remaining days, she needs:

2 cups/day × (365 - 180) days = 2 × 185 = 370 cups

In total, Cecilia needs 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year.

Since one bag has 110 cups, she'll need:

550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year!

77	If Raymond makes half as much wash as Sarah, and Sarah makes 4 times as much wash as David, calculate the difference in the amount of wash that Raymond and David make if Sarah makes 400 kilograms of wash.	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah makes 400 kg of wash.
David makes 1/4 of what Sarah makes, so David makes 400 / 4 = 100 kg of wash.
Raymond makes half of what Sarah makes, so Raymond makes 400 / 2 = 200 kg of wash.

The difference between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 kg.

78	Vincent can buy 3 bouquets of flowers for $2.50 or 2 bouquets for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the best price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

3 bouquets for $2.50 means 1 bouquet costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
2 bouquets for $1 means 1 bouquet costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

The best price is $0.50 per bouquet. For 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 ÷ 3 = 6 bouquets.
Cost at best price: 6 bouquets × $0.50 = $3
Cost at higher price: 6 bouquets × $0.83 = $5

Vincent saves: $5 - $3 = $2

Let's count Charlie's stickers in isiZulu:

Charlie had 10 stickers initially.
He bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31.
He got 23 more for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54.
He gave his sister 9, so he had 54 - 9 = 45.

84	A soccer team has played 22 games and won 8 times as many as they lost. How many did they win?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If they won 8 times as many as they lost, that means if they lost x games, they won 8x games.

We know they played a total of 22 games, so the number of games they lost plus the number of games they won should equal 22.

Let's write an equation: x + 8x = 22

Combine like terms: 9x = 22

Divide by 9: x = 22/9
x = 2 with a remainder of 4 (but we can't have a fraction of a game, so we'll ignore the remainder)

So, they lost 2 games. And if they won 8 times as many, they won... (drumroll)...16 games!

Let's break it down:

Gene travels 4 times a year, and he's been traveling since he was 23. He's now 34, so he's been traveling for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In each year, he travels 4 times, so he has 4 T-shirts per year. In 11 years, he'll have 4 x 11 = 44 T-shirts.

Each T-shirt is a block, so Gene has 44 blocks of bedspreads in total.

How many times has the alarm ringed in total?	22	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first time it rings, it rings 4 times.
2. The second time it rings, it rings 3 times longer than the first time, so it rings 4 + 3 = 7 times.
3. The third time it rings, it rings half as long as the second time, so it rings 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 times. Since it can't ring a fraction of a time, let's round it down to 3 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

4 + 7 + 3 = 14

So, the alarm rang a total of 14 times.

87	The firm pays each of its employees R600 per month. The firm has a policy of increasing the salaries of each employee by 10% of the current annual salary for those who have been with the firm for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years at the firm last December, what is her annual salary after another three years of service?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sylvie's current monthly salary is R600.
Her annual salary is R600 x 12 = R7,200.

After 5 years, she gets a 10% increase, which is R7,200 x 0.10 = R720.
So, her new annual salary is R7,200 + R720 = R7,920.

After another 3 years, she'll still earn R7,920 per year.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Izolo Sylvie izoba ngumuntu ongaphansi kwesikhathi esiyi-3, wayeyena R7,920 ngonyaka."" (Today, Sylvie will be earning R7,920 per year after another 3 years.)"	3
88	Marilyn's first album sold 10 times as many copies as Herald's. If they sold 88,000 copies altogether, how many copies did Herald sell?	8000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. 

Let Herald's album sales be x. Then Marilyn's album sales are 10x. 

We know they sold 88,000 copies altogether, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 10x = 88,000 

Combine like terms: 

11x = 88,000 

Divide both sides by 11: 

x = 8,000 

So Herald sold 8,000 copies.

89	Christina is planning a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest, because 1/4 of the guests will not come. She has invited 16 friends. Gift bags cost $2. How much will you spend?	24	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 won't come. To find 1/4 of 16, multiply 16 by 0.25: 16 x 0.25 = 4. So, 4 friends won't come.

That means 16 - 4 = 12 friends will attend. She needs 75 gift bags for each guest, so she'll need 12 x 75 = 900 gift bags.

Gift bags cost $2 each, so the total cost will be 900 x $2 = $1800.

If there are going to be 20 adults and 5 toddlers at the picnic, how many kilograms of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?	225	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad
* 1 baby dinosaur eats half of what an adult eats, so 10/2 = 5 lbs
* There are 20 adults, so they'll eat 20 x 10 = 200 lbs
* There are 5 toddlers, so they'll eat 5 x 5 = 25 lbs
* Total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 lbs
* To convert pounds to kilograms, we divide by 2.2 (since 1 lb is approximately 0.45 kg)
* 225 ÷ 2.2 = 102.27 kg

Ted needs to bring approximately 102.27 kilograms of potato salad to the picnic.

Let's break it down:

* James is 10 years old.
* Corey is a year younger than James, so Corey is 10 - 1 = 9 years old.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 9 - 2 = 7 years old.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 7 - 5 = 2 years old.

93	Lee was able to run the 400-yard dash two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400-yard dash. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400-yard dash in 38 seconds, how fast could Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-yard dash in seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee ran the 400-yard dash in 38 seconds. Gerald was 2 seconds slower, so he ran it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new time is 40 - (40 x 10/100) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald can run the 400-yard dash in 36 seconds with his improved diet.

97	When Freda cooked the canned tomatoes in the sauce, they lost half their volume. Every 16 grams of canned tomatoes she used contained three tomatoes. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 grams of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* 32 grams of sauce is the final product.
* Since the canned tomatoes lost half their volume, the initial volume of canned tomatoes was 32 x 2 = 64 grams.
* Every 16 grams of canned tomatoes contained 3 tomatoes, so we can set up a ratio: 16 grams : 3 tomatoes = 64 grams : x tomatoes.
* To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4 (since 64 is 4 times 16): 64 grams : x tomatoes = 16 grams : 3 tomatoes × 4 = 12 tomatoes.

98	Cars lined up in a traffic lane. Some cars pass for 15 minutes in traffic, then another 20 cars pass for the remaining 15 minutes of traffic. 5 cars from the line now exit without needing to pass through traffic. If there were 30 cars in the traffic lane, how many cars passed through traffic in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 30 cars were in the traffic lane initially.
* 5 cars exited without passing through traffic, leaving 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
* In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars passed through traffic.
* So, in the first 15 minutes, 25 - 20 = 5 cars passed through traffic.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"	5
99	Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new plants from her favorite greenhouse. She already has 2 plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country house. Feeling generous, she decided that she would give one plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many plants would Mary have left?	58	"Ndi Igbo, Mary ga-ebi 18 osisi ọhụrụ site na ụlọ ọhụrụ ya kacha ụtọ. O nwere osisi 2 na ọ bụla n'ime 40 ledge ụlọ ya.

100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many sounds did the doorbell make?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so that's 20 + (20 x 1/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times.

So, the doorbell made 175 sounds!

106	John has 3 boxes. Each box is 2 inches [5 cm] by 2 inches [6 cm] by 2 inches [4 cm] in size, and the walls are about one inch [1 cm] thick. What is the volume of all 3 boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the volume of one box first. The inner dimensions of the box are 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm), since the walls are 1 inch (1 cm) thick.

Volume of one box = Length x Width x Height = 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm = 15.625 cubic centimeters (or 15.625 cm³)

Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume is:

Total volume = 3 x 15.625 cm³ = 46.875 cubic centimeters (or 46.875 cm³)

107	Frankie watches television after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches a one-hour episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watches several episodes of a 30-minute program. On Thursday, he finishes his work early and watches a one-hour and 30-minute episode of the program. On Friday, he had to stay late for the weekend, so he watches two one-hour episodes. If he watches 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights x 1 hour/night = 2 hours
Wednesday: unknown number of 30-minute episodes = x hours
Thursday: 1.5 hours (1 hour + 30 minutes)
Friday: 2 hours

Total hours watched: 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Combine like terms: x + 5.5 = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides: x = 1.5 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

Divide by 30 minutes per episode: 90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes/episode = 3 episodes

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute program on Wednesday."	30
108	Henry bakes cakes for a baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he has baked 15 more cakes than he wanted. He breaks his 5 cakes when he puts them in the oven, and now he has a total of 110 cakes. How many cakes did Henry bake last year?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Henry wanted to bake twice as many cakes as he did last year. Let's call the number of cakes he baked last year ""x"". So, he wanted to bake 2x cakes this year.

However, he ended up baking 15 more cakes than he wanted, which means he baked 2x + 15 cakes.

Unfortunately, he broke 5 cakes, leaving him with a total of 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cakes.

We know that he has a total of 110 cakes, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cakes last year.

109	The city's gas station sells gasoline for $3.00 per litre. The app firm offers a cashback of $20.00 per litre if you cross the station. If a person buys 10 litres of gasoline, how much will their gasoline be, after the cashback rewards?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Ukuthenga 10 litres ukuya ku-$3.00 per litre, ukuthola ukuthi ukuphakama kwaleli gasoline kukuba ku-$30.00. (Buying 10 litres at $3.00 per litre means the cost of that gasoline is $30.00.)

Ukuba ufaka imali yokubuyisela ku-$20.00 per litre, ukuthola ukuthi ukuphakama kwaleli cashback kukuba ku-$200.00. (If you add the cashback of $20.00 per litre, the cashback amount is $200.00.)

Ngakho, ukuthenga kwaleli gasoline ngemuva kokubuyisela kukuba ku-$30.00 - $200.00 = -$170.00. (So, the cost of that gasoline after the cashback is $30.00 - $200.00 = -$170.00.)

Kutheni, ungathenga leli gasoline ngemuva kokubuyisela ngaphandle kokuthenga imali. (That means you'll get that gasoline for free after the cashback.)

If both of them ate all the packages, how many did they eat at least?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of packages each of them ate:

Beatrice: 2 packages wide and 24 packages long = 2 x 24 = 48 packages

In total, they ate at least 48 + 42 = 90 packages.

111	Julia's boat leaked in the lake. The boat took two liters of water for ten feet when she returned to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to drive twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water did the boat carry when Julia reached shore?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola into! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

* The boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.
* Julia drove 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.
* The shore is 64 seconds away, so she traveled a distance of 1.25 feet/second x 64 seconds = 80 feet.
* Since the boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, it took 2 liters/10 feet x 80 feet = 16 liters of water when Julia reached the shore.

Let's break this down step by step.

Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, then Brittany's phone can hold:

1800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos

Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's duck cage, so the number of birds in Jamal's duck cage is:

300 ÷ 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's duck cage in the zoo!

115	Sasha notices that the price of the lumber has gone up by 50% in the last few months after she bought some more. Since she has some left over, she decides to sell them. She has ten leftover 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each. She also has five 4x4x10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?	90	"Odi nma! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's calculate Sasha's profit:

For the 2x4x10 boards:
Original price = $10 each
New price = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
Sasha has 10 boards, so she sells them for 10 x $15 = $150
She bought them for 10 x $10 = $100, so her profit is $150 - $100 = $50

For the 4x4x10 boards:
Original price = $16 each
New price = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each
Sasha has 5 boards, so she sells them for 5 x $24 = $120
She bought them for 5 x $16 = $80, so her profit is $120 - $80 = $40

Total profit = $50 + $40 = $90

Sasha makes a profit of $90. Nnoọ! (That's ""good"" in Igbo!)"	90

Now, let's solve the problem! Since the ratio is 7:13, we can add 7 + 13 = 20. To find the number of groups of 20, we divide 120 by 20, which gives us 6. So, Katy has used 6 groups of 7 tablespoons of sugar, which is 6 x 7 = 42 tablespoons of sugar."	42

Count the number of shipments delivered on the second day, assuming that the shipments contained 5 vehicles.	4	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Let's break it down:

On the first day, there were 2 shipments with 5 vehicles each, making a total of:
2 x 5 = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find out how many vehicles were delivered on the second day, we subtract the initial 10 vehicles from the total:
30 - 10 = 20 vehicles

Since each shipment contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles delivered on the second day by 5 to find the number of shipments:
20 ÷ 5 = 4 shipments

So, 4 shipments were delivered on the second day!

119	Adrien's total income was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. After four years, her income went up, and she was earning 40 percent more than she had four years earlier. If Adrien and Lylah's income went up at the same time, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years earlier, count the total income they both earned four years later?	95200	"Jambo! (Hello!) In Swahili, I'll break it down for you.

Let's start with Adrien's income four years earlier: $40,000.

Lylah's income four years earlier was 30% lower than Adrien's, so:
$40,000 - (30% of $40,000) = $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000.

Four years later, Lylah's income increased by 40%, so:
$28,000 + (40% of $28,000) = $28,000 + $11,200 = $39,200.

Adrien's income also increased, but we don't know by how much. Since their income went up at the same time, let's assume Adrien's income increased by the same percentage as Lylah's, which is 40%. So:
$40,000 + (40% of $40,000) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Now, let's add their incomes four years later:
$39,200 + $56,000 = $95,200.

(Translation: Jennie has a collection of unstamped letters, and a collection of stamped letters. She stamps a third of the unstamped letters. If there are 30 letters in a collection of stamped letters, how many were there in the collection when Jennie started?)

Let's say the number of unstamped letters is x. A third of x is x/3. The number of stamped letters is 30. So, the total number of letters is x + 30.

Since a third of the unstamped letters were stamped, we can set up the equation:

x/3 + 30 = x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 45

So, there were 45 letters in the collection when Jennie started.

Later when she went to set the table, she had 12 bowls. How many of those plastic bowls were there in the box that Julia had bought?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Julia used 3 bowls to hold the soup.
She had 12 bowls when she went to set the table.
Her husband bought 5 new bowls.

To find out how many bowls Julia bought initially, let's subtract the number of bowls her husband bought and the number of bowls she used from the total number of bowls:

12 (total bowls) - 5 (bowls her husband bought) - 3 (bowls Julia used) = 4

So, Julia must have bought 4 + 5 = 9 bowls initially.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Julia wayebonga amabhokisi angu-9!"" (Julia bought 9 bowls!)"	9
126	Dylan needed chicken and fish sausages to make the sausage buns for the party. He bought 38 more chicken and 6 more fish sausages than chicken. How many sausages did Dylan buy?	82	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Let the number of chicken sausages be x.

Since Dylan bought 38 more fish sausages than chicken, the number of fish sausages is x + 38.

The total number of sausages is the sum of chicken and fish sausages: x + (x + 38) = 2x + 38.

We don't know the exact value of x, but we can express the total number of sausages in terms of x.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlelo ezinhlanu ezingu-2x + 38."" (There are 2x + 38 sausages in total.)

If you provide the value of x, I can give you the exact total!"	38
127	After attending a new school, Amy had 20 more friends than Lily had. If Lily had 50 friends, how many friends did Lily and Amy have together?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Lily had 50 friends. Amy had 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy had 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Together, Lily and Amy had 50 + 70 = 120 friends.

128	Mrs. Well sells pumpkins, peppers, and oranges at the village store. A pumpkin costs three times as much as a pepper. An orange costs less than 5 times as much as a pumpkin. Dillon is called to the store to buy 4 pumpkins, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much will he spend in total if one pepper is $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* One pepper costs $15.
* A pumpkin costs three times as much as a pepper, so 3 x $15 = $45.
* An orange costs less than 5 times as much as a pumpkin, so it costs less than 5 x $45 = $225. Let's assume it costs $200 (less than $225).
* Dillon buys 4 pumpkins, so that's 4 x $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers, so that's 20 x $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges, so that's 10 x $200 = $2000.

In total, Dillon will spend $180 + $300 + $2000 = $2480.

129	The hospital accepts 500 people a day. The patient is seen for 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 500 people a day, each seen for 24 minutes = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes
* Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours
* Doctors charge $150 an hour, so the hospital pays 200 hours x $150 = $30,000
* The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they earn 200 hours x $200 = $40,000
* Profit = earnings - costs = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

130	Nissa employs 60 workers to make themselves into elves in her shop in the village of Santa. A third of the elves retire after the children have washed them, and the remaining 10 elves retire after the children have gone to bed. How many elves are left?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Nissa starts with 60 workers/elves.

A third of them retire, which means 60 ÷ 3 = 20 elves retire.

That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves retire, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, 30 elves are left.

133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles. On Tuesday, he walked six times as many miles as Monday. Monday through Wednesday, he walked 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as Monday, so 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
From Monday to Wednesday, he walked 41 miles.
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, let's add Monday and Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
Now, subtract the total miles from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles from Monday to Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

134	Tom washes the car 4 times a month. If a car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?	720	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Tom uyawasha imoto ngamahora amane emenyweni. Uma imoto ingena $15, ungakuthola ukuthi uyaphi kangaka emnyakeni?

(Tom washes the car 4 times a month. If a car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?)

Ukubonga, ungakuthola ukuthi Tom uyaphi $15 x 4 = $60 emenyweni. Uma unyaka une 12 emenyweni, ungakuthola ukuthi uyaphi $60 x 12 = $720 emnyakeni.

(Okay, you can see that Tom pays $15 x 4 = $60 per month. If a year has 12 months, you can see that he pays $60 x 12 = $720 per year.)

Ngithanda ukuthola ukuthi uyaphi $720 emnyakeni! (I'm happy to see that he pays $720 per year!)"	720
135	Brian's friend Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian does. If Brian has 20 video games and loses 5 before the comparison, how many does Bobby have?	40	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkulumo yakho! (I'm happy to answer your question!)

Let's break it down: Brian has 20 video games and loses 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left.

The question says Bobby has five times fewer video games than Brian. To find out how many Bobby has, we can divide Brian's games by 5: 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

So, Bobby has 3 video games. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	3

137	Rory buys 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cakes for $1 each and they are delivered to her. There is a 20% delivery fee that is included in the payment and she wants to give a gift of $5. How much is the delivery fee?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items:

2 subs = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cakes = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Rory wants to give a gift of $5, so the total amount she needs to pay is:
$20.00 (items) + $5.00 (gift) = $25.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total amount, which is:
$25.00 x 0.20 = $5.00

So, the delivery fee is $5.00.

140	Of the 20 vehicles rented, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage are semi-automatic?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic vehicles: 20 (total) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 (semi-automatic)

141	There are 700 bees in their hive. Worker bees are twice as numerous as honeybees, and honeybees are twice as numerous as queen bees. Where are the worker bees?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Queen bees are the least numerous, so let's start with them. If honeybees are twice as numerous as queen bees, that means honeybees are 2x queen bees.
* Worker bees are twice as numerous as honeybees, so worker bees are 2x honeybees.
* Since honeybees are 2x queen bees, worker bees are 2x (2x queen bees) = 4x queen bees.

Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of queen bees. Then, the number of honeybees is 2x, and the number of worker bees is 4x.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms:

7x = 700

Divide by 7:

x = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees. Honeybees are twice as numerous, so there are 2x = 200 honeybees. Worker bees are four times as numerous as queen bees, so there are 4x = 400 worker bees.

The worker bees are in the hive, and there are 400 of them!

144	Kim has started her own housekeeping business and is adding the profit she will make from her customers. She already has 3 customers, but she has 5 customers she is talking to and she is sure she can include them in her calculations. Each customer's house will need 2 bottles of bleach and a packet of fabric to be cleaned. The bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and the packs of fabric will cost $5 each. These are the costs she has. She says that in a week she will make $92. The difference between her income and the cost, then how much profit will Lucas make in a week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kim has 3 existing customers and 5 potential customers, so she'll have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 customers.

Each customer needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 packet of fabric, so the total cost of supplies will be:

* Bleach: 8 customers x 2 bottles/customer = 16 bottles
* Fabric: 8 customers x 1 packet/customer = 8 packets

The total cost of supplies will be:
* Bleach: 16 bottles x $2/bottle = $32
* Fabric: 8 packets x $5/packet = $40
* Total cost: $32 + $40 = $72

Kim says she'll make $92 in a week. To find her profit, we subtract the total cost from her income:
Profit = Income - Total cost
= $92 - $72
= $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 in a week.

145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple garden. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can plant his pineapples after every 3 months. How many pineapples can John plant in a year?	4000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 10 hectares of pineapple garden, with 100 pineapples per hectare. So, he can plant 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples every 3 months.

In a year, there are 12 months. To find out how many times John can plant in a year, divide 12 by 3: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

So, John can plant 4 times in a year. Multiply the number of pineapples he can plant every 3 months by 4: 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""John ukwazi ukuphatha amapayini ayi-4000 emenyweni eyodwa!"" (John can plant 4000 pineapples in one year!)

Let's count the Lego bricks:

* 1 box with 500 Lego bricks
* 1 box with 3 times as many, so 3 x 500 = 1500 Lego bricks
* 1 box with a quarter of 500, so 500 ÷ 4 = 125 Lego bricks

Adding them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego bricks

Johnny will collect 2125 Lego bricks!

147	Debra checks the hive to see how many bees are entering and exiting each day. She sees 30 bees leaving their hive in the first 6 hours, and sees 1/2 of those returning after 6 hours. She sees more than the previous number leaving after 6 hours. Each bee that has left before returns to the hive after 6 hours. How many bees has Debra seen returning to the hive after 6 hours a day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
After 6 hours, half of those return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
Then, more bees leave the hive than the previous number, which means more than 30 bees leave.
Since each bee that has left before returns to the hive after 6 hours, all the bees that left initially will return, which is 30 bees.
Additionally, the bees that left later will also return, but we don't know the exact number. Let's call it x.
So, the total number of bees returning to the hive after 6 hours is 15 + 30 + x.

However, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x. But we can say that the total number of bees returning is at least 45 (15 + 30).

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingu-45 ezibuya emhlabeni ngemuva kwesikhathi sesithupha."" (There are at least 45 bees returning to the hive after 6 hours.)"	6
148	Brittany and her mother go to the museum. Admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gives the cashier the price of a ticket for 1 child and 1 adult.

(If you take the money that is twenty-two, you can get the money that is twenty-two in change.)

Let's calculate: 1 adult ticket is $12, and 1 child ticket is $10, so together it's $12 + $10 = $22. If she got $8 in change, that means she gave the cashier $22 + $8 = $30."	30

* Charlie's friends are three times as many as Dorothy's, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, Dorothy has 12 ÷ 3 = 4 friends.
* James's friends are four times as many as Dorothy's, and Dorothy has 4 friends. So, James has 4 × 4 = 16 friends.

If Tim rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be standing in the house before the loser finishes the competition?	4	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Steve lives 3 miles from school, and 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet. So, Steve needs to ride:

3 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet

At a rate of 440 feet per minute, Steve will take:

15,840 feet ÷ 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

to get home.

Tim lives 2 miles from school, which is:

2 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

At a rate of 264 feet per minute, Tim will take:

10,560 feet ÷ 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

to get home.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. The winner will be standing in the house for:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

before the loser finishes the competition.

153	Dave bought a large packet of chips and ate fourteen of them before a sea turtle stole the packet from his hand. When the sea turtle arrived, it ate half of the chips Dave had eaten. Three penguins chased it away from the food and each penguin ate three chips. Later, a racoon stole 2/3 of the remaining chips. The toad took the last chip, leaving five behind. How many chips were in the packet when Dave bought them?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* Dave ate 14 chips, and the sea turtle ate half of those, which is 7 chips.
* So, 14 - 7 = 7 chips were left from what Dave ate.
* Three penguins ate 3 chips each, which is 3 x 3 = 9 chips.
* 7 - 9 = -2, but we can't have a negative number of chips, so we'll come back to this later.
* Let's focus on the original packet. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining chips, and the toad took the last chip, leaving 5 behind.
* If the raccoon stole 2/3, that means 1/3 was left. So, the 5 chips left plus the 1 chip the toad took make up 1/3 of the original packet.
* To find the total number of chips, we can multiply 6 (5 + 1) by 3, which gives us 18 chips.
* Now, let's go back to the chips Dave ate. We know he ate 14 chips, and the sea turtle ate 7. That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 chips in the packet when Dave started eating.
* But we just calculated that there were 18 chips in the original packet. This means Dave must have eaten 3 chips before the sea turtle arrived (21 - 18 = 3).
* So, the total number of chips in the packet when Dave bought them is 18 + 14 - 3 = 29 chips.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three one-hour classes. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has two-hour classes a day. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend in classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kimo uyofunda izihlandla eziyisithupha kuMsombuluko, kuLwesithathu, kuLwesifane. KuLwesibili kuLwesine uyofunda izihlandla ezimbili zesikhathi esiyi-2. Emenyuweni eyodwa, iminyaka leyofunda Kimo iyisikhathi esingaki?""

Now, let's calculate:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays = 3 days x 3 hours/day = 9 hours
Tuesdays and Thursdays = 2 days x 2 hours/day = 4 hours
Total hours per week = 9 + 4 = 13 hours
In one semester (approximately 15 weeks), Kimo spends = 13 hours/week x 15 weeks = 195 hours

155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes a day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill were to put these cooked foods in heights, how many feet would they be?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total length of the baked goods:

Rolls: 300 x 4 inches = 1200 inches
Croissants: 120 x 6 inches = 720 inches

Total inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, let's convert the total inches to feet:
3360 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill were to stack these cooked foods, they would be 280 feet high!

157	Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run fastest in 15 minutes. They decide to compete on a soccer field for 100 meters. Blake runs 15 times. Kelly runs once, then decides she doesn't want to run in front of Blake, so she starts running on the 40 meter line. She does this 34 times. How far has the fountain run?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Hmm, it seems there's a misunderstanding. There's no fountain running in this scenario. It's Blake and Kelly who are running. Let me help you with the calculation:

Blake runs 100 meters 15 times, so he covers a distance of:
100 meters x 15 = 1500 meters

Kelly runs 60 meters (100 - 40 = 60) 34 times, so she covers a distance of:
60 meters x 34 = 2040 meters

So, Blake has run 1500 meters, and Kelly has run 2040 meters. There's no fountain involved in this competition."	2040
158	Raphael went shopping for school supplies. He bought 4 pencils for $1.50 each, two booklets for $4.00 each, a roll of bond paper for $20. How much did Raphael spend?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much Raphael spent:

4 pencils x $1.50 = $6.00
2 booklets x $4.00 = $8.00
Roll of bond paper = $20.00

Total amount spent = $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00

Raphael spent thirty-four dollars.

Translation: ""What is the total number, Finn saw 11 lizards in the pool, then he saw 6 that came out from under the lily pad, and then he saw 2 hiding on a rock. How many lizards are there in total? The total number is 11 + 6 + 2 = 19."""	19
160	The water tank is 17 feet deep on Monday. On Tuesday the tank has 7 feet more water. On Tuesday the tank has 2/3 of the water it had on Tuesday. On Wednesday how much water is in the tank?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, the tank is 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it has 7 feet more, so it's 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.
On Tuesday, it has 2/3 of the water it had on Tuesday, so it's 2/3 × 24 = 16 feet deep.

On Wednesday, the tank has 16 feet of water.

161	Anakin and Locsin went out to sea today. Anakin has 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin has 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish have they all caught?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the fish:

Anakin has:
10 starfish
6 seahorses
3 clownfish

Locsin has:
5 fewer starfish than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 fewer seahorses than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses
2 more clownfish than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Total fish:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total fish: 19 + 13 = 32

162	If a bag of marble costs $20, and the price increases by 20% every second month, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial price = $20
Increase = 20% every 2 months

After 2 months = $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months = $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months = $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months = $34.56 + (20% of $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months = $41.47 + (20% of $41.47) = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months = $49.76 + (20% of $49.76) = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months = $59.71 + (20% of $59.71) = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months = $71.65 + (20% of $71.65) = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months = $85.98 + (20% of $85.98) = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months = $103.18 + (20% of $103.18) = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months = $123.82 + (20% of $123.82) = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months = $148.58 + (20% of $148.58) = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months = $178.30 + (20% of $178.30) = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months = $213.96 + (20% of $213.96) = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months = $256.75 + (20% of $256.75) = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
After 32 months = $308.10 + (20% of $308.10) = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
After 34 months = $369.72 + (20% of $369.72) = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
After 36 months = $443.66 + (20% of $443.66) = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost approximately $532.39.

Let's break it down:

* 1 doll = 3 war toys = 3 x $5 = $15
* 1 red car = $4
* Total cost of red cars = 5 x $4 = $20
* Total cost of war toys = 3 x $5 = $15
* Total cost of all toys = $15 + $20 + $15 = $50

164	Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her own taxes or hire an accountant. If she does her own taxes, she will lose 3 hours of work, losing $35 an hour. An accountant costs $90. How much money will she have if she hires an accountant?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the answer in isiZulu:

Uma uJackie ebamba iqhaza le-accountant, uya kuba nesicelo sesikhathami somali esingama-90. Uma uJackie wayeka imisebenzi yakhe, uya kuba nesicelo sesikhathami somali esingama-3, esingama-35 ngamahora. Uma sihluke, uya kuba nesicelo sesikhathami somali esingama-105. Uma uJackie ebamba iqhaza le-accountant, uya kuba nesicelo sesikhathami somali esingama-15 kulokho okutholakala.

(Translation: If Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $90 less. If Jackie does her own taxes, she will lose 3 hours of work, which is $35 per hour. If we subtract, she will have $105 less. If Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $15 more than what she would have lost.)

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant."	15
165	For her 30th birthday, Elvira has chosen a new computer and lots of decorations as a gift. She has a budget of R1500 given to her by a relative and thinks she will be able to save at least some money to buy clothes. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs R1090 with a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also buys a scanner for R157, a CD burner for R74, and a printer for R102. How much money will she have left over for clothes?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

R1090 (computer) + R157 (scanner) + R74 (CD burner) + R102 (printer) = R1423

Elvira had a budget of R1500. To find out how much money she'll have left over, subtract the total cost from her budget:

R1500 - R1423 = R77

So, Elvira will have R77 left over for clothes.

167	Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, their ages will add up to 28. How old is Seth?	16	"""Seth oyi aburo Brooke abasa. Mma abasa ebiri, ogugu ha ga-eri 28. Olee Seth?"" (Igbo)

Translation: Let Seth's age be 2x and Brooke's age be x. In 2 years, their ages will add up to 28. So, (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28. Simplifying, we get 3x + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 8. So, Seth's age is 2x = 2(8) = 16.

""Olee Seth? O nwere afọ 16."" (Igbo)

169	Pancho walks 20 miles a day, except on weekends when he walks 10 miles. How many miles does he walk a week?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So, he walks a total of:

20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles a day, that's 2 days. So, he walks a total of:

10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

Now, let's add the miles walked during the week and on weekends:

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles a week!

Let me calculate the total number of legs for you.

80 spider monkeys with 8 legs each = 80 x 8 = 640 legs
90 insects with 6 legs each = 90 x 6 = 540 legs
3 rare invertebrates with 10 legs each = 3 x 10 = 30 legs

Adding them all up, Jake sees a total of 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs today!

Let's break it down:

* Sally Four is 8 years old.
* Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
* Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

There are four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Caboose. The total number of birds is still 4."	4
173	Jessica is trying to figure out how much she should pay off her debts each month. Her education bills are $300 a month, her credit cards are $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debts, how much does she pay off in a year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total debt Jessica needs to pay each month:

$300 (education) + $200 (credit cards) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000 per month

To pay off more than 50% of her debts, she needs to pay more than $500 per month. Let's assume she pays $600 per month.

In a year, she will pay:

$600 per month x 12 months = $7200 per year

174	Billy peels and slices the potatoes to make a potato salad for the family's big convention pesonama. It's a big party, he now has 60 potatoes. The potatoes are the same size, so he takes the same amount of time to peel and slice. Billy takes a minute and a half to peel, but he takes 5 seconds to slice. How long does it take you to finish processing the potatoes?	95	"Odi o! (That's ""okay"" in Yoruba!)

Let's break it down:

Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel each potato, and 5 seconds to slice each potato. To find the total time for one potato, we add these times: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes (converted 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.583 minutes.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60: 1.583 minutes × 60 = 95 minutes.

Orire, Billy will take 95 minutes to finish processing the potatoes! (That's ""good"" in Yoruba!)"	95
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. A gallon of lemons costs $3, and a gallon of sugar costs $2. They sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses a gallon. When they make a profit of $25, how much have they spent on lemons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

They sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses a gallon, so they make $10 per gallon (20 x $0.50).

They make a profit of $25, so they must have made $25 + (cost of lemons + cost of sugar) in total.

Let's say they used x gallons of lemons and y gallons of sugar. Then, they made 10x + 10y dollars in total.

The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is 3x. The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost of sugar is 2y.

We know that 10x + 10y = 25 + 3x + 2y. Simplifying, we get 5x + 8y = 25.

Since they must have used at least one gallon of lemons and one gallon of sugar, let's try x = 1 and y = 1. This gives us 5 + 8 = 25, which is true!

So, they used 1 gallon of lemons and 1 gallon of sugar. They spent 3 dollars on lemons.

Let's break it down:

Total Asians = 240
Japanese = 80
So, Chinese = 240 - 80 = 160

Number of boys in Chinese team = 60
To find the number of girls, we subtract:
Girls in Chinese team = 160 - 60 = 100

177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on work, 1/3 on car fuel and sends the remaining half to the people he loves. He gives his daughter R200 to spend on her needs during the week and gives his wife R700 to buy food and other household needs.	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Zaid spends 1/4 on work, 1/3 on car fuel, and the remaining half on his loved ones.

That means he spends 1 - (1/4 + 1/3) = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12 on his loved ones.

He gives his daughter R200 and his wife R700, so together that's R900.

Since this is 5/12 of his salary, we can set up the equation:

5/12 × x = 900

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 12/5:

x = 900 × 12/5
x = 2160

So Zaid's salary is R2160.

Bo has 40 miles.
Monic has 4 fewer miles than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 miles.
Rani has 10 more miles than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 miles.

Adding up the total number of miles:
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 miles.

* So, the number of white carnations is 200 ÷ 5 = 40.
* Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4 × 40 = 160.

186	Russell works in a pet store, and distributes the hay. The baskets are kept in 3 cages and divided into equal groups, with each crate being given 6 hay bales. There are 10 hamster cages kept alone and each hamster is given 5 hay bales. There is also a rabbit hutch where 20 hay bales are distributed to the rabbits. Hay is not used anywhere in the store. If 160 pieces of hay are divided among these animals, how many baskets are in one hutch?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

First, the 3 cages with baskets have 6 hay bales each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 hay bales.

The 10 hamster cages have 5 hay bales each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 hay bales.

The rabbit hutch has 20 hay bales.

In total, there are 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 hay bales used.

Since 160 pieces of hay are divided among these animals, and 88 are already used, that means there are 160 - 88 = 72 hay bales left.

These 72 hay bales are divided among the baskets in the 3 cages. Since each cage has an equal number of baskets, we can divide 72 by 3 to find the number of baskets in one cage: 72 ÷ 3 = 24.

So, there are 24 baskets in one hutch!

188	A merchant buys bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 a bag. If moving one bag from the farm to the store costs $2, and the merchant made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags for $30 a bag, how many bags did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inhloso. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Ukuthola ukuthi umthengi wayenza inhloso yokuthengisa amabhagi wezithelo, kufanele siqhube isikhathi sokuthenga, ukuthenga, nokuthengisa.

(Understanding that the merchant made a profit by selling bags of wheat, we need to calculate the time of buying, transporting, and selling.)

Ukuthenga kwamabhagi = $20/amabhagi (Cost of buying a bag)
Ukuthenga kwesikhathi sokuthenga = $2/amabhagi (Cost of transporting a bag)
Ukuthengisa kwamabhagi = $30/amabhagi (Selling price of a bag)

Ukuthola ukuthi umthengi wayenza inhloso yokuthengisa amabhagi, kufanele siqhube ukuthi ukuthenga kwamabhagi + ukuthenga kwesikhathi sokuthenga = ukuthengisa kwamabhagi - inhloso.

(To find the profit, we need to calculate the cost of buying and transporting minus the selling price plus the profit.)

Let's say the number of bags sold is x.

$20x + $2x = $30x - $400

Simplifying the equation:

$22x = $30x - $400

Subtracting $30x from both sides:

-$8x = -$400

Dividing both sides by -$8:

x = 50

Kutheni, umthengi wayenza inhloso yokuthengisa amabhagi angu-50. (Therefore, the merchant made a profit by selling 50 bags.)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	50
189	These friends spent $20.25 on party tickets. They spent $4.50 less on food than they did on tickets. They even got on a sports car for $33 each. If they don't agree to split the cost equally, how much does each person spend?	34	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he plants 10 x 10 = 100 trees.

He cuts down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he cuts down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.

He starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Then, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which gives us 39. So, 39 trees die.

Now, we subtract the dead trees from the total: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Kulungile! (That's okay!) Tom has 91 trees left.

In isiZulu, we say: ""Kunezinhlobo ezinhlanu nezinkulungwane"" - There are 91 trees."	91

On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned 1/3 of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back in front of Sue's yard. Now, on Sunday morning, they added 18 pink flamingos to the existing number. By noon on Sunday, how many pink flamingos were there?	24	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Friday: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday: 1/3 of 18 = 6 flamingos returned, painted white, and put back. So, 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. Plus 6 white ones, making a total of 18 flamingos.
Sunday: 18 new pink flamingos added to the existing 12 pink ones = 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

196	200 kilograms of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a city. Each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many kilograms of carrots are not to be used?	120	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's convert 2 pounds to kilograms: 2 pounds = 0.907 kilograms (approximately)

Each restaurant receives 0.907 kilograms, so for 40 restaurants, it's: 40 x 0.907 = 36.28 kilograms

The total amount of carrots is 200 kilograms, so the amount not used is: 200 - 36.28 = 163.72 kilograms

197	In the town of Soda, there are 23,786 inhabitants, including 8,417 men and 9,092 women. The rest of the population are children. How many children are there in Soda?	6277	"Kuliko! (That's ""okay"" in Swahili!)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total inhabitants = 23,786
Men = 8,417
Women = 9,092
Total adults = 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509

Now, let's find the number of children:
Children = Total inhabitants - Total adults

198	Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards do you have now in total?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected 3 times that number: 20 x 3 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she had collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she had collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) x 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine has 320 Pokémon cards now in total!

(Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark edits 1000 sentences in total, divided equally between two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns:
500 sentences × 5 cents = $25

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Mark earns:
500 sentences × 10 cents = $50

Mark's total weekly earnings are:
$25 + $50 = $75

201	John wins a prize at work. The prize consists of a one-time salary of R5000 plus a 5% salary increase. If he makes R2000 a week, every week of the year, and receives the prize on the first day of the year, how much money has he made in the year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John's weekly salary is R2000. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

R2000/week × 52 weeks/year = R104,000/year

The prize is a one-time salary of R5000, so he gets an additional:

R104,000/year + R5000 = R109,000

The 5% salary increase means his new annual salary is:

R109,000 × 1.05 = R114,450

So, John has made a total of R114,450 in the year.

He ate cheese and eggs for breakfast 3 days a week using 1 slice of bread rather than 1 slice of cheese for each sandwich. He made a lot of macaroni and cheese that he would eat for a few dinars a week, and used 8 slices of cheese on them. How many slices of cheese did he use?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the cheese slices:

* He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch, and there are 7 days in a week. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 slices.
* He ate cheese and eggs for breakfast 3 days a week, but he used 1 slice of bread instead of cheese, so that's 0 slices.
* He made macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.

Adding them up, Carl used 14 + 0 + 8 = 22 slices of cheese.

Janet had 22 green pencils and 10 yellow pencils, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pencils initially.

She bought 6 bags of blue pencils with 9 pencils in each bag, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pencils.

She also bought 2 bags of red pencils with 6 pencils in each bag, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pencils.

Now, let's add up all the pencils: 32 (initial pencils) + 54 (blue pencils) + 12 (red pencils) = 98 pencils.

Janet now has 98 pencils! Nke a bu nke! (That's ""That's it!"" in Igbo.)"	98
205	Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows students to subtract the lowest marks each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests, how many scores does he need on the sixth test to get 93?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Brinley's total score without the lowest mark:

Total score = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Since Mr. Bert allows students to subtract the lowest mark, we subtract 71 from the total score:

Total score - lowest mark = 367 - 71 = 296

To get a total score of 93, Brinley needs:

Total score / number of tests = 93 x 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract the total score without the sixth test from the desired total score:

558 - 296 = 262

So, Brinley needs a score of 262 on the sixth test to get a total score of 93.

Let's break it down:

* 1 chocolate bar weighs 40g.
* Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple bar, so 1 apple bar weighs 40g ÷ 2 = 20g.
* There are 25 chocolate bars, so their total weight is 25 x 40g = 1000g.
* There are 80 candy apples, so their total weight is 80 x 20g = 1600g.
* Add the weights of the chocolate bars and candy apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Each plate costs $6,000, so total cost = 6 x $6,000 = $36,000

Sarah takes care of the neighbor's kids 4 times, she gets $5 for each time she takes care of them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she shaves her beard. If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started taking care of the kids, how many times does she have to shave her beard before she can buy a jacket and shoes?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of the items Sarah wants to buy:

Jacket: $30
2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sarah earns $5 for each time she takes care of the kids, and she takes care of them 4 times, so she earns:
4 x $5 = $20

She already had $10 saved, so she now has:
$10 + $20 = $30

To find out how much more she needs, subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$70 - $30 = $40

Sarah earns $4 for each time she shaves her beard. To find out how many times she needs to shave her beard, divide the amount she still needs by her earnings per shave:
$40 ÷ $4 = 10

So, Sarah needs to shave her beard 10 times to buy the jacket and shoes.

214	Jerry has two swimming pools, which leak water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be x gallons. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the small pool lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons, and the big pool lost 2x x 4 = 32 gallons.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 32 gallons. But we know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 32 = 4x - 64
2x = 4x - 32
2x - 4x = -32
-2x = -32
x = 16

So, the small pool had 16 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 with a 10% interest. If you pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will Janeth have left?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount Janeth paid: $165/month × 12 months = $1,980

The interest on the loan is 10% of $2,000: $2,000 × 0.10 = $200

Total amount Janeth owes: $2,000 (initial loan) + $200 (interest) = $2,200

Since Janeth paid $1,980, she still owes: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220

So, Janeth will have $2,000 - $220 = $1,780 left.

219	Four students scored 251 points on the board game. Naomi scored 68. Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi, and Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi.	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the points:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Adding up the points, we get:
68 + 78 + 85 = 231 points.

The four students scored a total of 251 points, so the fourth student scored:
251 - 231 = 20 points.

223	The company spends $15,000 on advertising a year, and then spends a third of that on advertising for the year. How much money has the company spent on advertising in two years?	20000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: The company spends $15,000 on advertising a year, and then spends a third of that, which is $15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000. So, the total spent in one year is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000. In two years, the company would spend $20,000 × 2 = $40,000.

224	Carlos and Benji are at sea. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much do they pay when they all rent?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost:

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he pays:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Together, they pay:
$90 + $90 = $180

Let's break it down:

By bus, it takes 3 days from New Jersey to Rochester.
By car, it takes half of those days, which is 3/2 = 1.5 days.

To get to Rochester by bus and back by car, it will take Andrew 3 days (by bus) + 1.5 days (by car) = 4.5 days.

226	James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 vegetable cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 vegetable cards and buys 14 vegetable cards, what is the probability that the water card will be selected?	33	"Ngiyakwazi ukuthola ukuthola! (I can help you with that!)

Let's first find the total number of cards James has:

30 (fire) + 20 (vegetable) + 40 (water) = 90 cards

He loses 8 vegetable cards, so he has:

20 (vegetable) - 8 = 12 vegetable cards left

Then, he buys 14 more vegetable cards, so he now has:

12 + 14 = 26 vegetable cards

The new total number of cards is:

30 (fire) + 26 (vegetable) + 40 (water) = 96 cards

The probability of selecting a water card is the number of water cards divided by the total number of cards:

40 (water) / 96 = 5/12

So, the probability of selecting a water card is 5/12 or approximately 0.417.

227	Robert bought a homemade burrito for lunch. A basic burrito is $6.50. He adds meat for $2, cheese for $1, avocado for $1, and 2 sausages for $0.25 each. He decides to add his own food for $3.00, where he can add chips and soda. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses when he pays. How much is he still owed?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Basic burrito = $6.50
Meat = $2
Cheese = $1
Avocado = $1
2 sausages = $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total additions = $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.50 = $4.50
Total cost = $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00
He adds his own food for $3.00, so total cost = $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

He uses a $5.00 gift card, so he still owes:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

228	Kalinda is working on a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda can put together 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can put together half of Kalinda's pieces in a minute. How many hours will it take them to put this puzzle together?	1	"Nzuri sana! (Very good!) Let's break it down.

Kalinda can put together 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can put together half of Kalinda's pieces, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces in a minute. Together, they can put together 4 + 2 = 6 pieces in a minute.

There are 360 pieces in the puzzle. To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can do in a minute: 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour to put the puzzle together.

229	The pumpkin farm produced 120 young pumpkins. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the pumpkins were ready for harvest, and then she took them home. When she returned after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest, and my mother took them. How many pumpkins were not ready for harvest after two weeks?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 120 young pumpkins.

After 2 months, 30% were ready for harvest, which is:
120 x 0.3 = 36 pumpkins

Ashlyn took 36 pumpkins home, leaving:
120 - 36 = 84 pumpkins

After 2 weeks, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready for harvest, which is:
84 x 3/4 = 63 pumpkins

My mother took 63 pumpkins, leaving:
84 - 63 = 21 pumpkins

So, 21 pumpkins were not ready for harvest after two weeks.

230	Mark parks 12 cars for his company. He sells each car for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on cars and $1,000 registration fee for each car. How much money does he charge?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Mark's earnings:

Mark sells 12 cars for $20,000 each, so his total revenue is:
12 cars x $20,000 = $240,000

He pays 10% tax, which is:
$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

He also pays a $1,000 registration fee for each car, so that's:
12 cars x $1,000 = $12,000

Total expenses are:
$24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $36,000

Now, let's subtract the expenses from the revenue:
$240,000 - $36,000 = $204,000

So, Mark earns $204,000.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""UMark uyaphumelela izimali eziyi-$204,000."" (Mark earns $204,000.)"	204000

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 chips initially.
Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 chips left.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 x 5 = 10 chips. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 chips left.
Ginger gave Griffin some chips, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer than Kyle's, which is 5 - 3 = 2 chips.
Since Griffin eventually had 27 chips, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - (9 + 2) = 16 chips.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 16 chips.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cakes, and her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cakes.

Since one cake has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.
