0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. Every morning, she eats three for breakfast and uses the other four to make muffins for her friends. What's left over, she sells daily at the farmer's market for $2 a fresh duck egg. How much (in dollars) does she make each day at the farmer's market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the eggs: 16 eggs - 3 for breakfast = 13 eggs. 13 eggs - 4 for muffins = 9 eggs left.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes: 9 eggs x $2 = $18 per day.

2	Josh sets out to renovate a house. He buys one for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. The value of the house then increases by 150 percent. What profit has he made?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000, so his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The value of the house increases by 150%, which means it becomes 2.5 times its original value (1 + 1.5 = 2.5). So, the new value of the house is $130,000 x 2.5 = $325,000.

To find the profit, subtract the total investment from the new value: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.

So, Josh has made a profit of $195,000.

3	Jacques does a series of three sprints three times a week. He runs 60 meters at each sprint. In total, how many meters does he run per week?	540	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

UJacques uyaphenduka izisuku ezintathu ngosuku olune, futhi uyaphenduka izisuku ezintathu ngalinye isisuku. Ukuba uyaphenduka izisuku ezintathu ngosuku olune, kuthiwa uyaphenduka izisuku ezingama-60 ngalinye isisuku. Ngokuba uyaphenduka izisuku ezintathu ngosuku olune, kuthiwa uyaphenduka izisuku ezingama-180 ngosuku olune. Ukuba uyaphenduka izisuku ezintathu ngosuku olune ngalinye isuku, kuthiwa uyaphenduka izisuku ezingama-540 ngosuku onke.

(Translation: Ah, I understand! Jacques does three sprints three times a week, and he runs 60 meters per sprint. If he does three sprints per day, that's 180 meters per day. If he does three sprints per day, three times a week, that's 540 meters per week.)"	540
4	To keep her chickens healthy, Wendi gives them three bowls of mixed food containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables every day. She feeds them in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 more. If her farm has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food should she give them for the last meal of the day?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola umbuzo wakho! (I love getting your question!)

Let's break it down:

Wendi gives 3 bowls of food per meal, and she feeds them 3 times a day. So, the total number of bowls per day is 3 x 3 = 9 bowls per chicken.

Since there are 20 chickens, the total number of bowls needed per day is 9 x 20 = 180 bowls.

In the morning, Wendi gives 15 bowls, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 more. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 bowls.

To find out how many bowls are left for the last meal, we subtract the total given so far from the total needed: 180 - 40 = 140 bowls.

Since Wendi gives 3 meals a day, we divide the remaining bowls by 3: 140 ÷ 3 = 46.67. Since you can't give a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 46 bowls.

So, Wendi should give them 46 bowls of food for the last meal of the day.

5	Kylar goes to the store in order to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay to buy them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.
The pattern continues: $5, $3, $5, $3,... (alternating between $5 and $3).

Let's calculate the total cost:

8 glasses at $5 each = 8 x $5 = $40
8 glasses at $3 each = 8 x $3 = $24
Total cost = $40 + $24 = $64

Kylar will have to pay $64 to buy 16 glasses.

In English, that's: ""Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has four times that, and Toulouse has twice Charleston's amount. If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep in total."""	260
7	Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She is downloading at the rate of 2 GB per minute but at 40% download, Windows requires a restart to install the updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla then has to start the download again from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, so to download 200 GB, it would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

However, at 40% download, which is 80 GB (40% of 200 GB), Windows requires a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download again from the beginning.

So, she downloads 80 GB in:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

Then, she restarts and downloads the entire 200 GB again:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

Adding the time it took to download the initial 80 GB, the restart time, and the time to download the entire file again, we get:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.

8	John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns back after realizing that he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in traffic jams. For the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph for the remaining time on the 4 hours. What is the distance between him and his home at the end of the 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he turns back and tries to get home in 4 hours. He loses 2 hours in traffic jams, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 hours left.

For the next half hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

For the remaining time (2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances he covered while driving back home:
Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially, the distance between him and his home at the end of the 4 hours is:
Distance = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

9	For the first 40 hours of work a week, Elisa's hourly rate is $10. For her overtime hours, she also receives 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours this week, what will her weekly wage be?	460	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuphakama kwakhe. (Let me help you calculate her wage.)

Elisa worked 45 hours, and 40 of those hours are at her normal rate of $10 per hour. So, her normal wage is:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400

She also worked 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40 = 5). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her normal rate, which is:

$10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime wage is:

5 hours x $12/hour = $60

Her total weekly wage is:

$400 + $60 = $460

Ukuphakama kwakhe kwisonto ukuba $460. (Her weekly wage is $460.)

10	A new program was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month. It then decreased by 30 percent in the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded in those three months?	366	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times.
In the second month, it was downloaded 3 times that amount, so 60 x 3 = 180 times.
In the third month, it decreased by 30%, so it was downloaded 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 times.
In total, the program was downloaded 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times.

Let's calculate the total cost:

Three dozen doughnuts at $68 a dozen = 3 x $68 = $204
Two dozen cupcakes at $80 a dozen = 2 x $80 = $160
Six dozen cheesecake cupcakes at $55 a dozen = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The cost of planting is 90 dollars. Each year, the tree will produce seven lemons that will be sold for $1.5 each. Watering and nurturing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?	13	"""Sawubona! (Hello!) 

Let's calculate the profit Carlos will make each year: 
7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year 

Subtract the cost of watering and nurturing: 
$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year 

Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. 
To find out how many years it'll take, divide the initial cost by the annual profit: 
$90 ÷ $7.5/year = 12 years 

So, it'll take Carlos 12 years to start making money with his lemon tree.

13	Melanie does door-to-door sales. When she moved to the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, then two more to the red house, and finally half of what was left in the orange house. If Melanie has five vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Let's say Melanie had x vacuum cleaners initially.

She sold a third of them at the green house, so she had 2x/3 left.

Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2.

Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, leaving her with (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18

So, Melanie had 18 vacuum cleaners at the beginning!

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20 percent of them are enrolled in contemporary dance, 25 percent in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""hello"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students
25% of 20 students are enrolled in jazz dance = 0.25 x 20 = 5 students
Total students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
20 - 9 = 11 students

To find the percentage, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(11 ÷ 20) x 100 = 55%

So, 55% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

15	A merchant hesitates between two buying plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates on a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronics market during the same month. If the merchant makes a choice that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would that profit be?	125	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Increase: 2.5% of $5,000 = $125
New value: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Increase: 1.2% of $8,000 = $96
New value: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry option, which would give him a profit of $125.

19	Marissa is hiking a 12-mile-long trail. It took her 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to reach to walk the remaining distance?	6	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking! 

Let's break it down. Marissa has walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 1 + 1 = 2 hours. She wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles. So, she needs to complete the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles in a time that will give her an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Let's calculate the total time she needs to take: Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours. She has already taken 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

Now, let's find the speed she needs to reach: Speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.

So, Marissa needs to reach a speed of 6 miles per hour to walk the remaining distance. Ngiyakuthanda (I love) helping with math problems!"	6
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice made up of two-thirds of water, and I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made up of three-quarters of water, and I'm going to turn over a liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Orange juice: 2/3 water in 10 liters = 2/3 × 10 = 20/3 liters of water
Pineapple juice: 3/4 water in 15 liters = 3/4 × 15 = 45/4 liters of water

You'll turn over 1 liter of orange juice, leaving 9 liters. The water content in the remaining orange juice is:
20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters

Now, mix the remaining orange juice with the pineapple juice: 6 liters (water in orange juice) + 45/4 liters (water in pineapple juice) = 24 + 45 = 69 liters

To find the total water content in the 24 liters, convert the mixed water content to a fraction: 69/24 = 23/8

So, the water content in the remaining 24 liters is 23/8 or 2.875 liters.

We know the sum of their current ages is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now, find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age in 10 years, add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years. ""Asante"" (Thank you) for the question!"	10
31	Gunter is trying to count candy in a jar. He asks his friends to estimate the amount. One of them says 80, another says 20 more than half of the first one. A third says 25 percent more than the first one. What is the average of their estimates?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The first friend says 80.

The second friend says 20 more than half of the first one, which is 20 + (80 / 2) = 20 + 40 = 60.

The third friend says 25 percent more than the first one, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's find the average:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

So, the average of their estimates is 80.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	80

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. The gold coins are 30 coins more than the silver ones. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Gretchen una-mali angu-110. Ama-coins akhodi angu-30 angaphezulu kwama-silver.

Kuthola ukuthi ama-silver angu-x, ama-gold angu-x + 30.

Ama-gold + ama-silver = 110

X + (x + 30) = 110

2x + 30 = 110

2x = 110 - 30
2x = 80

X = 80/2
X = 40

Ama-gold = x + 30
Ama-gold = 40 + 30
Ama-gold = 70

Gretchen una-mali angu-70 akhodi! (Gretchen has 70 gold coins!)"	70

(Translation: Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points in the next 20 minutes. How many points did he score in total?)

Let's calculate!

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.
In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more, which is:
4 points x 1.25 (25% increase) = 5 points

Total points scored by Mike = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Mike uyithola imipondo engu-9! (Mike scored 9 points!)"	9

38	John runs 60 miles every week. He runs three days a week. On the first day he runs for three hours and runs twice less the other two days. What is his running speed?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

UJohn uyaphenduka izihlandla ezingama-60 ngosuku olunele. Uyaphenduka izinsuku ezintathu ngosuku. Kusukela kwesokuthathu, uyaphenduka imihla emithathu, futhi uyaphenduka kakhulu kabi izinsuku ezimbili ezalandelayo.

(John runs 60 miles every week. He runs three days a week. On the first day, he runs for three hours, and runs twice less the other two days.)

Let's calculate his running speed:

UJohn uyaphenduka izihlandla ezingama-60 ngosuku olunele. Uyaphenduka izinsuku ezintathu ngosuku. Kusukela kwesokuthathu, uyaphenduka imihla emithathu, futhi uyaphenduka kakhulu kabi izinsuku ezimbili ezalandelayo.

(John runs 60 miles every week. He runs three days a week. On the first day, he runs for three hours, and runs twice less the other two days.)

Imihla emithathu = 3 hours
Izihlandla ezingama-60 ÷ 3 = 20 miles per hour

UJohn uyaphenduka ngokushesha kwamahora angama-20.

(John runs at a speed of 20 miles per hour.)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	20
39	Dana runs four times faster than she walks, but jumps twice as fast as she runs. If she jumps at a speed of three miles per hour, how many miles does she cover in six hours, knowing that she spends one-third of that time running and two-thirds walking?	18	"Kamuzu! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

If Dana jumps at 3 miles per hour and jumps twice as fast as she runs, then she runs at 3/2 = 1.5 miles per hour.

If she runs four times faster than she walks, then she walks at 1.5/4 = 0.375 miles per hour.

She spends 2/3 of the time walking, which is 2/3 × 6 = 4 hours, and 1/3 of the time running, which is 1/3 × 6 = 2 hours.

So, she covers a distance of 0.375 × 4 = 1.5 miles while walking and 1.5 × 2 = 3 miles while running.

In total, she covers 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 miles.

Nzuri sana! (Very good!)

In Swahili, I'd say: ""Anaenda kwa umbali wa maili 4.5."" (She covers a distance of 4.5 miles.)"	4
40	Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's. If Suzie's iPhone is one year old, how old is Brandon's?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Suzie's iPhone is 1 year old.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 x 2 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."	8
41	Perg, the great dragon, sat atop Mount Farbo and spewed fire from a distance of 1,000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but to a distance of 400 feet, well within range of its flames. However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw it three times farther. By holding the gemstone, how far could Polly keep herself out of reach of the flames, while still managing to strike the dragon with the golden javelin?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthi uPolly ungathola ukudla ingubo yakhe ngaphezulu kwesikhathi esingama-400 amafutha, kodwa uma eqonde ithi sapphire, ungathola ukudla ingubo ngaphezulu kwesikhathi esingama-1200 amafutha.""

In English, that means: ""Polly could throw the javelin 400 feet, but with the sapphire, she could throw it 1200 feet.""

To answer your question, Polly could keep herself out of reach of the flames (1000 feet) while still managing to strike the dragon with the golden javelin, as 1200 feet (her new throwing distance with the sapphire) is greater than 1000 feet."	1000
42	Grandma Jones prepared five apple pies for the firemen's lunch. She then cut each pie into eight pieces and arranged the five pies on the buffet table for everyone to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after all the guests had taken and eaten their pies, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces did the guests take?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Grandma Jones had 5 pies, and each pie had 8 pieces. So, in total, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.

After the guests took their share, 14 pieces were left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	26
43	According to its nutritional information, a bag of potato chips contains 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag contains five servings, how many grams of potato chips would you eat, knowing that your daily calorie target is 2,000 and that you've already consumed 1,800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ukuba ungoweni 2000 calories ngosuku, futhi uwudla okungenani 1800 calories, ukuthola ukuthi ungenza 200 calories kuphela. (If your daily target is 2000 calories and you've already consumed 1800 calories, that means you have 200 calories left.)

Isipho sokuqala sesi-250 calories, futhi isipho esingena kwi-bag yakho yi-5. (One serving is 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in your bag.)

Ukuthola ukuthi ungenza 200 calories, ungakwazi ukudla isipho esingena kwi-0.8. (To get 200 calories, you can eat 0.8 servings.)

Isipho esingena kwi-bag yakho yi-300 grams, futhi isipho esingena kwi-bag yi-5. (The bag weighs 300 grams, and there are 5 servings in the bag.)

Ukuthola ukuthi isipho esingena kwi-1 yi-300/5 = 60 grams. (So, one serving is 300/5 = 60 grams.)

Ukuthola ukuthi ungakwazi ukudla isipho esingena kwi-0.8, ungakwazi ukudla amagrames angu-0.8*60 = 48 grams. (So, you can eat 0.8 servings, which is 0.8*60 = 48 grams.)

44	Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. Each pound of beeswax allows him to produce 10 tapered candles. A pound of beeswax and matches is delivered for $10. If he produces and sells 20 candles, what is his net profit, knowing that each candle is sold for $2.00?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cost of 1 pound of beeswax and matches = $10
Number of candles produced from 1 pound of beeswax = 10
Cost per candle = $10 ÷ 10 = $1 per candle
Selling price per candle = $2
Number of candles sold = 20

Revenue = Number of candles sold × Selling price per candle = 20 × $2 = $40
Cost = Number of candles sold × Cost per candle = 20 × $1 = $20
Net profit = Revenue - Cost = $40 - $20 = $20

Umphakathi, Charlie's net profit is $20! (That's ""congratulations"" in Zulu!)"	20

47	John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue ties

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought:

5 x 2 = 10 red ties

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost:

$40 x 1.5 = $60 each

He spent on red ties:

10 x $60 = $600

Total amount spent on ties:

$200 + $600 = $800

Let's break it down:

Uriah needs to reduce the weight by 15 pounds.
He removes 30 comic strips, each weighing a quarter of a pound, so that's 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.
To reduce the weight by 15 pounds, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more.
Since each toy weighs a half pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

62	If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives a pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Assuming that she resigns after 30 years of service, what will her annual pension be?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Marcy's pension:

After 40 years, Marcy gets $50,000 per year.
After 20 years, she gets 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500 per year.
For every additional year, she gets an additional 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500.
So, for 30 years, she gets 10 years of additional pension (30 - 20 = 10).
10 years x $2,500 per year = $25,000 per year.

Adding the initial 20-year pension, her total annual pension will be:
$2,500 (20 years) + $25,000 (10 additional years) = $27,500 per year.

Umsebenzi wakhe! (That's her pension!)"	27500
63	Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 a month. If the streaming company charged that amount in the first half of the year and then 10% less in the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.	1596	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

First half of the year (6 months): $140/month × 6 months = $840

Second half of the year (6 months): $140/month × 0.9 (10% less) = $126/month × 6 months = $756

Total amount paid: $840 + $756 = $1,596

64	Sophie is contemplating a car trip and wonders how far she can travel with just one full tank of gas. She has done 100 miles since the last fill up and had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill the tank. The user manual says her tank has a capacity of 12 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophie travel with just one full tank of gasoline?	300	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate how many miles Sophie can travel with one full tank of gas.

Since Sophie traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to refill, we can find out how many miles she can travel per gallon:

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, let's multiply the miles per gallon by the tank capacity (12 gallons):

25 miles/gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophie can travel 300 miles with just one full tank of gasoline!

65	Jim spends two hours watching TV, then decides to go to bed and read for half the time he spends watching. He repeats this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and half that time reading, which is 2/2 = 1 hour reading. So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV and reading.

He repeats this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours watching TV and reading.

In 4 weeks, he spends 9 x 4 = 36 hours watching TV and reading.

In isiZulu, the answer is: ""UJim uyothola amahora angama-36 ekudla ngokushaya iTV kanye nokufunda emizameni emine."""	36
66	A basketball tournament hosts four schools competing. Each school sent a women's team and a men's team, each consisting of five players. The schools also each sent a coach. How many people did the schools send in total?	48	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""Let's count!"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Each school sent 2 teams (women's and men's) with 5 players each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 players per school.
Each school also sent 1 coach, so that's 10 players + 1 coach = 11 people per school.
There are 4 schools, so in total, they sent 11 people/school x 4 schools = 44 people.

Let's break it down:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubies: 175 - 35 = 140
* Emeralds: 2 × 140 = 280

70	On weekdays, Judy gives five dance lessons every day and eight lessons on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in a week?	7425	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

On weekdays, Judy gives 5 dance lessons/day × 5 days = 25 lessons
On Saturdays, she gives 8 lessons
Total lessons in a week = 25 + 8 = 33 lessons

Each lesson has 15 students, so total students in a week = 33 lessons × 15 students/lesson = 495 students

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so total money made in a week = 495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425.00

93	Lee used to run the 400 meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. But after changing his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee runs the 400 meter hurdles in 38 seconds, what is Gerald's running time in seconds after his new diet?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee runs the 400m hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald used to run 2 seconds slower, so Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of 40, multiply 40 by 0.9: 40 × 0.9 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald's running time after his new diet is 36 seconds.

96	Harry slept nine hours last night. His friend Jacques slept only two-thirds of that time. Compared to Jacques, how many more hours did Harry sleep?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Harry slept 9 hours. Jacques slept 2/3 of that, which is 9 x 2/3 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than Jacques.

97	When Freda cooks canned tomatoes to make sauce, they lose half their volume. She uses 16-ounce cans that each contain three tomatoes. Freda's last tomato sauce preparation yielded 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?	12	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Since the tomatoes lose half their volume, the 32 ounces of sauce came from 32 x 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Since each can is 16 ounces, Freda used 64 / 16 = 4 cans. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 4 x 3 = 12 tomatoes.

98	Cars are stuck in a queue on the highway. Some cars manage to get through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 other cars in the last 15. 5 cars get out of the queue so they don't have to cross the traffic jam. Given that there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars crossed the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway.

5 cars got out of the queue, so we're left with 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

In the last 15 minutes, 20 cars got through.

That means 25 - 20 = 5 cars got through in the first 15 minutes.

So, the answer is: 5 cars crossed the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

99	Mary loves gardening. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already had two on each of the 40 windowsills of her large country house. So she decided that tomorrow, she will take one potted plant from each window sill and give it generously to friends and relatives. How many potted plants will Mary have left?	58	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Mary ugene 18 amagatya emithi emisha yakhe, futhi wayene amagatya amabili emnyango wesithupha wesifazane sakhe esikhulu. Kepha uqonde ukuthi kusasa, uya kubamba igatya elilodwa emnyango wesithupha, uya kubakhokhela abafowethu nabafana bakhe. Kanjani amagatya angaba khona kuMary?""

Now, let's calculate: Mary had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 windowsills, so she had 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants initially. She received 18 new ones, making it 80 + 18 = 98. Tomorrow, she'll give away 1 potted plant from each window sill, which means 40 plants will be given away. So, Mary will be left with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants."	58
100	One day, four friends visited Jerome. The first one rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it, the second one 1/4 times longer than the first, and the third 10 times longer than the fourth. Given that the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
The third friend rang it 10 times longer than the fourth, so 60 x 10 = 600 times.
The second friend rang it 1/4 times longer than the first, which means 20 x 1.25 = 25 times.
Now, let's add them up: 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705 times.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The doorbell rang 705 times in total.

On weekends, however, he likes to relax and drink a soda at dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John drinks 4 glasses of water on weekdays (Monday to Friday) = 4 x 5 = 20 glasses

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks 3 glasses of water and 1 soda at dinner = 3 glasses of water x 2 days = 6 glasses

Total glasses of water John drinks in a week = 20 + 6 = 26 glasses

103	A bank of fog comes from the ocean and gradually covers a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. If the city extends 42 miles from the edge of the ocean to the opposite edge inland, how many minutes will it take for the bank of fog to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down, my friend. The fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, so to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1 mile, we divide 10 by 3, which gives us 10/3 = 3.33 minutes per mile.

Now, to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles, we multiply 42 by 3.33, which gives us 42 x 3.33 = 140 minutes.

So, it will take the bank of fog 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

104	Poppy is trying to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces. How many pieces of the puzzle are left to place?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy starts with 1,000 pieces. She puts a quarter (1/4) of them on the board, which is:
1,000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces

That leaves 1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mother puts a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces on the board, which is:
750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to place.

So, 500 pieces of the puzzle are left to place.

The internal volume of one box is 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal volume is 24 × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

107	Every night, Frankie watches TV after doing his homework. Last Monday and Tuesday, he watched an hour-long episode of his favorite show every night. Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. Friday, he was able to stay up late because of the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes each. If he watched a total of seven hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights x 1 hour/night = 2 hours
Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours
Total hours: 2 + 1.5 + 4 = 7.5 hours

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours, we need to subtract the extra 0.5 hours: 7.5 - 0.5 = 7 hours

Now, let's find the hours watched on Wednesday: 7 - 2 - 1.5 - 4 = 0.5 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), Frankie watched 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 episode on Wednesday.

108	Henri is making cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the batch, he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than planned. He drops five of his cookies while he cools them and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?	50	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let's solve this problem together.

Let's say Henri planned to make x cookies this year, which is twice as many as last year. So, he planned to make 2x cookies.

Since he made 15 more cookies than planned, he actually made 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 50

So, Henri planned to make 50 cookies this year, which is twice as many as last year. Therefore, he made 25 cookies last year.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Henri wayenza amakuki angu-25 esikhathini esidlule."" (Henri made 25 cookies last year.)"	25
109	A gas station sells gas at $3.00 a gallon. An app company offers a $0.20 refund per gallon if you fill up at that station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, what will be the purchase price, after the refunds?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the purchase price:

10 gallons x $3.00/gallon = $30.00 (initial purchase price)

Refund: 10 gallons x $0.20/gallon = $2.00

Purchase price after refund: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

110	Unfortunately, due to a mistake, Beatrice ends up with two wide rolls and 24 long rolls, while Marcell gets three wide rolls and 14 long rolls. If each of the two ate all their rolls, how many did they eat on average?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total number of rolls eaten by Beatrice and Marcell:

Beatrice: 2 wide rolls + 24 long rolls = 26 rolls
Marcell: 3 wide rolls + 14 long rolls = 17 rolls

Total rolls eaten: 26 + 17 = 43 rolls

To find the average, divide the total by 2:

43 rolls ÷ 2 = 21.5 rolls

So, on average, they ate 21.5 rolls each.

111	A leak occurred in Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat started taking two liters of water every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to go twenty feet. The shore being 64 seconds, how much water had the boat taken when Julia reached the shore?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Now, let's calculate: Julia takes 2 liters every 10 feet. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows 64 feet in 64 seconds. That's 64/10 = 6.4 times 10 feet. So, she takes 2 liters x 6.4 = 12.8 liters of water when she reaches the shore.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""UJulia uyathola amanzi angu-12.8 ukufika emkhathini."""	12

Brittany's phone can store up to 50 times more than there are birds in the photo that Jamal took, where we see ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many ducks can we see in the photo that he took?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone, so Brittany's phone can store 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos.

Brittany's phone can store 50 times more than the number of birds in the photo, so the number of birds in the photo is 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

So, we can see 6 ducks in the photo that Jamal took!

Let's break it down, my friend. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts are 7 + 13 = 20. Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up the equation:

20x = 120

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we'll multiply the number of parts by the ratio of sugar:

7x =?

Since each container has 5 vehicles, I'll divide the number of vehicles that arrived on the second day by 5: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 containers. 

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

119	Adrian's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, that salary had increased and was 40% higher than what he was earning at the start. If Adrian's and Lylah's salaries have increased simultaneously, and Adrian was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Initially, Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be x. Then Adrian's initial salary would be x + 30% of x = x + 0.3x = 1.3x.

We know Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000. So, 1.3x = 40,000. To find x, divide both sides by 1.3: x = 40,000 / 1.3 = 30,769.

Now, Lylah's initial salary was $30,769. Four years later, Adrian's salary increased and was 40% higher than his initial salary. So, his new salary is 40,000 + 40% of 40,000 = 40,000 + 0.4(40,000) = 56,000.

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage. Her new salary would be 30,769 + 40% of 30,769 = 30,769 + 0.4(30,769) = 43,000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later: 56,000 + 43,000 = 99,000.

So, the total amount of their two salaries four years later is $99,000.

* A watermelon costs 3 times as much as a pepper, so it's 3 x $15 = $45.
* An orange is 5 times cheaper than a watermelon, so it's $45 ÷ 5 = $9.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Dillon will spend:

* 4 watermelons = 4 x $45 = $180
* 20 peppers = 20 x $15 = $300
* 10 oranges = 10 x $9 = $90

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $90 = $570

So, Dillon will spend a total of $570.

129	A hospital admits 500 people a day. Each patient is examined for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations?	10000	"""Sawubona! (Hello!) 

Let's break this down. Each patient is examined for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. The hospital charges $200 per hour, so it charges each patient 0.4 x $200 = $80. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the hospital pays 0.4 x $150 = $60 per patient. 

The hospital makes a profit of $80 - $60 = $20 per patient. Since 500 patients are admitted per day, the hospital makes a profit of 500 x $20 = $10,000 per day.

130	Nissa hires 60 seasonal elves to play Santa's village in her department store. A third of the elves quit after kids threw up on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kicked them in the shin. How many elves are left?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Now, let's calculate:

Nissa had 60 elves initially. A third of them quit, which is 60 ÷ 3 = 20 elves. So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves remained.

Then, 10 more elves quit, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

133	On Monday, Walt walked four miles. On Tuesday, he walked six times as many miles as on Monday. His Monday-Wednesday mileage was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday, so 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
His Monday-Wednesday mileage was 41 miles, so let's add Monday and Tuesday's miles: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Brian owns 20 video games initially, but loses 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left.

Three times the amount of video games Brian owns is 3 × 15 = 45.

Bobby owns 5 video games less than that, so Bobby owns 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

Let's calculate the total cost:

2 submarines = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 packages of fries = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery fee (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
Total cost including delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Adding the $5.00 tip, the final total is = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Let's break it down:

* There are 12 blue gum balls.
* There are 22 times as many blue gum balls as there are four times as many pink gum balls.
* So, if we divide 12 by 22, we get the number of times four as many pink gum balls: 12 ÷ 22 = 0.55 (let's call this x).
* Since there are four times as many pink gum balls, we multiply x by 4: 0.55 × 4 = 2.2.
* Since we can't have a fraction of a gum ball, we round down to 2 pink gum balls.

So, there are 2 pink gum balls!"	2
140	Of the 20 rental cars available, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars and the rest are semi-automatic.	20	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I can help you with that.

141	A hive has 700 bees. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Queen bees: x
* Baby bees: 2x (twice as many as queen bees)
* Worker bees: 2(2x) = 4x (twice as many as baby bees)

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms:

7x = 700

Divide by 7:

x = 100

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:

Worker bees: 4x = 4(100) = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees!

He already has 3 clients, but his discussion with 5 other potential clients makes him confident enough to include them in his calculations. 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of rags will be needed to maintain each client's home. It will cost $2 per bottle of bleach and $5 per pack of rags. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Given the difference between total income and total expenses, in dollars, what profit will Kim make each week?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Kim has 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach ($2 each) and 1 pack of rags ($5 each), so the total expense per client is:
2 x $2 = $4 (bleach) + $5 (rags) = $9 per client

For 8 clients, the total expense is:
$9 per client x 8 clients = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, subtract the total expense from the total income:
$92 (income) - $72 (expense) = $20

Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

148	Brittany and her mother go to the museum. The entrance fee is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother gives the cashier money for one child ticket and one adult ticket. If she received a difference of $8, how much money, in dollars, did she give to the cashier?	30	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The difference between the adult ticket ($12) and the child ticket ($10) is $2.

If the mother received a difference of $8, that means she gave the cashier $8 + $2 = $10 more than the total cost of the two tickets.

The total cost of the two tickets is $12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22.

So, the mother gave the cashier $22 + $10 = $32.

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and pedals at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim travels on a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?	4	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuhamba kwabaqambi: (The distance of Steve) = 3 miles = 3 x 5280 feet = 15840 feet
Ukuhamba kwabaqambi: (The distance of Tim) = 2 miles = 2 x 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Izikhathi zokuhamba: (The time for Steve) = Ukudlula kwesikhathi (distance) / ukuvulela (speed) = 15840 feet / 440 feet/min = 36 minutes
Izikhathi zokuhamba: (The time for Tim) = Ukudlula kwesikhathi (distance) / ukuvulela (speed) = 10560 feet / 264 feet/min = 40 minutes

Ukuhlala kwesikhathi: (The waiting time) = Izikhathi zokuhamba (Time for Tim) - Izikhathi zokuhamba (Time for Steve) = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

153	Dave bought a large packet of chips and ate fourteen of them before a hungry seagull stole the packet from his hands. When the seagull landed, it swallowed half the amount of chips Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons forced the seagull away from the food and each of them was able to eat three chips. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. The ants took away one last, leaving five chips. How many chips were in the packet when Dave bought it?	48	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxaki yakho! (I love solving your problem!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 chips.
2. The seagull swallowed half of 14, which is 7 chips.
3. The pigeons ate 3 chips each, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 chips.
4. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining chips. Let's call the remaining chips x. Then, 2/3 of x is stolen, leaving 1/3 of x.
5. The ants took 1 chip, leaving 5 chips.

We can set up an equation:

x - 1 = 5
x = 6

So, there were 6 chips left after the raccoon stole some. Now, let's work backward:

6 is 1/3 of the remaining chips, so the remaining chips before the raccoon stole some is 6 x 3 = 18.

The pigeons ate 9 chips, so there were 18 + 9 = 27 chips before the pigeons ate.

The seagull swallowed 7 chips, so there were 27 + 7 = 34 chips before the seagull ate.

Dave ate 14 chips, so there were 34 + 14 = 48 chips in the packet when Dave bought it.

155	Every day, Bill makes 300 buns, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 chopsticks. The buns are 4 inches each, the croissants are 6 inches each, and the chopsticks are two feet each. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 300 buns x 4 inches each = 1200 inches
* 120 croissants x 6 inches each = 720 inches
* 60 chopsticks x 2 feet each = 120 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Total inches = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, convert inches to feet: 3360 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the baked goods will be 280 feet long.

162	If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the starting price goes up 20% every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. After 2 months, the price increases by 20%, so it becomes $20 x 1.2 = $24.

After 4 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $24 x 1.2 = $28.8.

After 6 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $28.8 x 1.2 = $34.56.

After 8 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $34.56 x 1.2 = $41.472.

After 10 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $41.472 x 1.2 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $49.7664 x 1.2 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $59.71968 x 1.2 = $71.663616.

After 16 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $71.663616 x 1.2 = $86.03639.

After 18 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $86.03639 x 1.2 = $103.243676.

After 20 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $103.243676 x 1.2 = $123.892408.

After 22 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $123.892408 x 1.2 = $148.67089.

After 24 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $148.67089 x 1.2 = $178.405068.

After 26 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $178.405068 x 1.2 = $214.086082.

After 28 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $214.086082 x 1.2 = $256.903298.

After 30 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $256.903298 x 1.2 = $308.283958.

After 32 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $308.283958 x 1.2 = $369.94035.

After 34 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $369.94035 x 1.2 = $443.92842.

After 36 months, it increases again by 20%, so it becomes $443.92842 x 1.2 = $533.114104.

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost approximately $533.11.

163	Several toys are arranged in a room: five red cars, three figurines and a doll. The doll costs the price of the three figurines, and a red car costs $4. Knowing that a figurine costs $5, what is the total value of the toys?	50	"""Odiro kende, ekitabo ekya leero! (That's a good question, my friend!)

Let's break it down:

* A doll costs the same as three figurines, so a doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.
* There are five red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.
* There are three figurines, each costing $5, so the total cost of the figurines is 3 x $5 = $15.
* Add the cost of the doll, red cars, and figurines: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50.

So, the total value of the toys is $50.

164	Jackie wonders if she should do her tax returns herself or hire an accountant. By doing it herself, she'll be able to do three hours of freelance work less, which represents a $35 loss of earnings per hour. The accountant asks her for $90. How much extra money will she have if she hires him?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the extra money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant.

If Jackie does her tax returns herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means a loss of 3 x $35 = $105.

If she hires an accountant, she'll pay $90.

So, the extra money she'll have if she hires an accountant is $105 - $90 = $15.

Sally Four = Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old
Granny Red = 2 x Sally Four = 2 x 8 = 16 years old
Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years old

Total age = Sally Two + Granny Red + Sally Four + Sally Thirtytwo

174	Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in order to prepare a potato salad for his big family barbecue. Since this is an important event, he has 60 potatoes to peel. The potatoes are about the same size, so it takes about the same time to peel and cut them. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long does it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?	95	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Hello"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's break down the time it takes Billy to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes to peel + 5 seconds to cut = 1.5 minutes + 5/60 minutes = 1.55 minutes.

Since he has 60 potatoes, the total time it takes Billy to finish preparing the potatoes is: 1.55 minutes/potato × 60 potatoes = 93 minutes.

175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

They sell 20 glasses at $0.50 each, so they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so they spend $5 per gallon in total.

To make a profit of $25, they need to sell $25 + $5 = $30 worth of lemonade.

Since they make $10 per gallon, they need to sell 3 gallons to make $30.

So, they spend 3 x $3 = $9 on lemons.

Let's break it down:

There are 240 Asians in total, with 80 Japanese and the rest Chinese. So, the number of Chinese is:
240 - 80 = 160

If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
2. Fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
3. Remaining amount: $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500
4. Donation: 1/2 of $2,500 = $1,250
5. Daughter's expenses: $200
6. Wife's expenses: $700

Total expenses and donations: $1,500 + $2,000 + $1,250 + $200 + $700 = $5,650

(I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Then, the number of red roses is 4x.
* She also ordered 200 calla roses, which is 5 times the amount of white carnations. So, 200 = 5x. To find x, divide both sides by 5: x = 200 ÷ 5 = 40.
* Now that we know x, we can find the number of red roses: 4x = 4(40) = 160.

Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 p.m. to keep Sandra as a customer!"	5
182	John is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half the age of Jan. If Jan is 30, how old is John?	23	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

If Jan is 30, then half of Jan's age is 30/2 = 15.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so Mark's age two years ago was 15 + 5 = 20.

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22.

John is two years older than Mark, so John's age is 22 + 2 = 24.

Therefore, John is 24 years old.

183	Two athletic teams compete in a 4 x 400 meter relay, a race where each team has four members who each run 400 meters, or a standard track lap. One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of its members runs the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded. Its first runner runs the 400 meters in 60 seconds, and then each following runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, in how many seconds will the fastest team win?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the times for each team:

Team 1 (well-rounded):
Each member runs 400m in 55 seconds, so total time = 4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Team 2 (less well-rounded):
1st runner: 60 seconds
2nd runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
3rd runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
4th runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds
Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in total time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. So, the fastest team will win in 2 seconds.

184	Jerry rolls a six-sided die. What is the probability (in percent) that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Ukuba Jerry ebhokisa isicathama sesithupha, ingaphantsi yokuba aqhube isamba esikhulu kune-3 kulandela ukuba aqhube isamba esivileyisi esibili kulandela.""

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of six possible outcomes.

The probability of getting an even number twice in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4, since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of six possible outcomes.

So, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

In percent, that's 25%.

186	Russell works in a pet store and distributes straw to the rodents. The rats are divided into 3 cages in groups of equal size and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamster cages. Each of them is alone in his cage and gets 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where we distribute 20 pieces of straw. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw were distributed to the small rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Rats: 3 cages, equal size, each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's call the number of rats in each cage ""x"". Then, the total straw for rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Hamsters: 10 cages, each alone, gets 5 pieces of straw. Total straw for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Rabbit pen: 20 pieces of straw.

Total straw distributed is 160. So, we set up the equation: 18x + 50 + 20 = 160.

Simplifying, we get: 18x + 70 = 160. Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get: 18x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 18, we get: x = 5.

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

Let's break it down:

Tom plants 10 trees/year and cuts down 2 trees/year, so he has a net gain of 8 trees/year.

In 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. So, he will have 100 - 20 = 80 new trees.

Adding these to the initial 50 trees, he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

After 30% of the trees die, he will be left with 70% of 130 trees, which is 0.7 x 130 = 91 trees.

So, Tom will have 91 trees left.

193	Sue lives in a neighborhood where there is a good mood. During one weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on her. On Friday morning, they placed 18 plastic flamingos in her garden. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back a third of the flamingos they had painted white and placed them in Sue's garden. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic flamingos were there than white flamingos?	24	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* On Friday, 18 flamingos were placed in Sue's garden.
* On Saturday, a third of the flamingos (18 ÷ 3 = 6) were taken back and painted white, leaving 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos in the garden.
* On Sunday morning, 18 more flamingos were added, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 flamingos.
* The number of white flamingos is 6.

To find the difference, subtract the number of white flamingos from the total number of flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more plastic flamingos than white flamingos.

195	A pen costs as much as a pencil and a piece of gum put together. If a pencil costs $1.20 and a piece of gum $0.30, what will be the price of eight pens?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

A pen costs as much as a pencil and a piece of gum put together, so:
Pen = Pencil + Gum
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, let's find the price of eight pens:
8 Pens = 8 x $1.50
= $12.00

So, the price of eight pens is $12.00.

197	In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23,786 inhabitants. 8,417 of them are men and 9,092 are women. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many children are there in Soda?	6277	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of children in Soda.

Total population = 23,786
Men = 8,417
Women = 9,092

Total adults = Men + Women = 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509

Now, let's subtract the total adults from the total population to get the number of children:

Children = Total population - Total adults = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 6,277 children in Soda.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinhlanhla ezingu-6,277 eSoda."" (There are 6,277 children in Soda.)"	6277
198	Elaine started out with 20 Pokemon cards. She collected three times as many at the end of one month. During the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she collected in the first month. Finally, during the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: Elaine collected 3 times 20 = 60 cards.
Total cards = 20 + 60 = 80

Month 2: She collected 20 fewer cards than Month 1, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
Total cards = 80 + 40 = 120

Month 3: She collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 200 cards.
Total cards = 120 + 200 = 320

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards!

199	Marc is a proofreader. He proofreads the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him at a different rate. Publisher B pays Marc twice as much as Publisher A. Marc edits a total of 1,000 sentences per week, while Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Marc make in a week, in cents?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Marc edits 1,000 sentences per week, divided equally between two publishers. So, he edits 1,000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Marc earns 500 x 5 = 2,500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice as much, so Marc earns 2,500 x 2 = 5,000 cents from Publisher B.

In total, Marc makes 2,500 + 5,000 = 7,500 cents per week.

201	John receives a prize at work. This prize consists of a one-time bonus of $5,000 and a salary increase of 5 percent. If he earns $2,000 a week, every week of the year, and he received the prize on the first day of the year, how much money did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John earns $2,000 a week, so in a year, he earns:
$2,000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The 5% salary increase means he'll earn an additional:
$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200/year

Add the one-time bonus of $5,000:
$104,000/year + $5,200/year + $5,000 = $114,200

So, John earned $114,200 that year.

203	Cheese is Carl's favorite food. He ate a sandwich every day of the week at lunch and used two slices of cheese in each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast three days of the week, using one more slice per omelet than he used per sandwich. He made a large plate of macaroni and cheese to ensure several dinners that week and used eight slices of cheese in its preparation. How many slices of cheese did he use in total?	31	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* Carl ate sandwiches every day of the week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 slices.
* He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days of the week. He used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 slices.
* He used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

Then, for the next 3 weeks, he cycled 2 times a week, 60 km each time. That's:
2 x 60 = 120 km per week
120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 km

Let's break it down:

* Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
* Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candy apple, a candy apple weighs 40 ÷ 2 = 20 grams.
* There are 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of chocolate bars is 25 × 40 = 1000 grams.
* There are 80 candy apples, so the total weight of candy apples is 80 × 20 = 1600 grams.
* The total weight of Joe's candy bag is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.

209	Twenty dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $6,000 each.	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Ukuthola ukuthi amacupu angu-20 dozen acophe $1,200 kulokho okutholakala ngokuthi kune-dozen eli-6,000 eli-6,000.

(To find out that 20 dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold for $6,000 each.)

I-dozen eli-6,000 = $6,000 x 6 = $36,000

(One dozen plates cost $6,000 x 6 = $36,000)

Ukuthi amacupu angu-20 dozen acophe $1,200 kulokho = $36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

(That means 20 dozen cups cost $1,200 less than $36,000 = $34,800)

Ukuthi amacupu angu-1 dozen acophe = $34,800 ÷ 20 = $1,740

(That means 1 dozen cups cost $34,800 ÷ 20 = $1,740)

Ukuthi amacupu angu-1 acophe = $1,740 ÷ 12 = $145

(That means 1 cup costs $1,740 ÷ 12 = $145)"	145
210	Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket she chose costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids four times and earns $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 every time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!) Let's do the math together.

Sara needs $30 for the jacket and 2 x $20 = $40 for the shoes. That's a total of $30 + $40 = $70.

She already had $10 and earned 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting. So, she has $10 + $20 = $30.

To get the remaining $70 - $30 = $40, she needs to mow the lawn. Since she earns $4 each time, she'll need to mow the lawn $40 ÷ $4 = 10 times.

211	Jerry has a chicken farm. Red chickens produce three eggs a day, and white chickens produce five eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than there are red ones, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem in isiZulu:

Kuthola ukuthi i-red chickens iyaphuma amaqiniso angu-3 ngosuku, kanti i-white chickens iyaphuma amaqiniso angu-5 ngosuku. Ukuba uJerry uyaphuma amaqiniso angu-42 ngosuku, futhi unayo amaqiniso amabili angu-2 kumakhulu kwezinye, ngabe unayo imiqiniso emihlanu?

(Translation: Let's find out how many red chickens Jerry has. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. If Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, and he has 2 more white chickens than red ones, how many red chickens does he have?)

Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.

We know that W = R + 2 (since Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red ones).

We also know that 3R + 5W = 42 (since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day).

Substituting W = R + 2 into the second equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, uJerry unayo amaqiniso emihlanu angu-4! (Jerry has 4 red chickens!)

212	Gary likes to walk along the edge of the local park, which is shaped like a rectangle of 1.5 miles by 6. If he walks at 3 miles per hour, how many hours of walking does he do?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 x 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time:

Time = Total Distance ÷ Speed
Time = 15 miles ÷ 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, Gary walks for 5 hours.

213	At the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers coming into the store, and the next day, she counts 50 more than the first day, and if on the third day, the total number of customers was 500, how many customers did she count that day?	250	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 100 customers
Day 2: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
Total customers for 2 days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers

To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total customers for the first 2 days from the total number of customers:
500 (total) - 250 (first 2 days) = 250 customers on the third day

214	Jerry has two pools, both with leaks that drain them at a rate of four gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now it has four times as much. How much water is in the small pool now?	8	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kwanele, ngicela ukubonga!"" (Okay, let me think!)

Let's break it down:

Let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be x. Then, the large pool had 2x.

The rate of drainage is 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, the small pool lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons, and the large pool lost 2x - 16 gallons.

Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let the amount of water in the small pool now be y. Then, the large pool has 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y

We know that y = x - 16, so substitute: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplify: 2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x = 4x - 48
2x - 4x = -48
-2x = -48
x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kulungile, ipuli elincane lisebenza 8 igalelo!"" (That's correct, the small pool has 8 gallons!)"	8

Harriet is 21, and Zack is twice as old, so Zack is 21 x 2 = 42.

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian is 21 x 3 = 63.

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

The average age is: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

So, in three years, the average age of the three will be 45.

221	A water tank holds 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water is there now in the cistern?	90	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Celine used 90 liters, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

She collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, so she collected 30 x 2 = 60 liters of rainwater.

Now, add the remaining water in the tank to the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Kutheni, kunawo amaliti ayi-90 ku-tank! (So, there are 90 liters in the tank now!)"	90
222	Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums. How many flowers does he plant in total?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 petunias less than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Total flowers = 90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

223	A company spends $15,000 on advertising in one year, and then spends a third of that on advertising in another year. What is the total amount the company spent on advertising in those two years?	20000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

A third of $15,000 is $5,000. To find the total, I'll add $15,000 and $5,000. That's $20,000.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Igazi lesithathu lesi-$15,000 liyi-$5,000. Ukuthola igazi, ngiyokuhlangana isi-$15,000 nesisi-$5,000. Kuyi-$20,000."""	20000
224	Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses his boat for three hours and Benji uses his boat for five hours, what will the total amount of their rentals be?	180	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total amount:

Carlos rents a canoe for $30/hour and uses it for 3 hours, so he pays:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana boat for $18/hour and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Total amount of their rentals is:
$90 + $90 = $180

In isiZulu, that's: ""Igazi lesi liyisi- $180."" (The total amount is $180.)"	180
225	Andrew plans a car trip from New Jersey to Rochester. It takes him six days to travel by bus and half that time for a car trip. How many days of travel will it take him if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car?	9	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking!

Let's calculate: It takes Andrew 6 days to travel by bus, and half that time (6 ÷ 2 = 3 days) to travel by car. To find the total travel time, add the bus trip time to the car trip time: 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

226	James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, what is the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest whole number) that a randomly chosen card is water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total number of cards James has initially: 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards.

He loses 8 water cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.

He buys 14 more grass cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass cards.

The new total number of cards is: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The number of water cards is 32, so the percentage chance of a randomly chosen card being water is: (32 ÷ 96) × 100% ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest whole number, it's 33%.

227	For his lunch, Chad ordered a composite burrito. The basic burrito costs $6.50, he adds an extra $2 of meat, $1.00 of cheese, $1.00 of avocado and two sauces at $0.25 per sauce. He chooses the premium option for $3.00 more, which allows him to add fries and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses at the checkout. How much is left to pay?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the cost:

Basic burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Two sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total so far: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Premium option: $3.00
Total cost: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

He uses a $5.00 gift card, so he needs to pay:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Kulungile! (That's correct!) He needs to pay $9.00."	9
228	Kalinda is trying to make a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. She is able to place four pieces per minute. Her mother places twice as many pieces per minute. How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?	1	"Mwana, mwana! (Ah, child, child!)

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute, and her mother places twice as many, which is 4 x 2 = 8 pieces per minute. Together, they place 4 + 8 = 12 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can divide 360 by 12: 360 ÷ 12 = 30 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 30 minutes by 60 to find the number of hours: 30 ÷ 60 = 0.5 hours.

So, it will take Kalinda and her mother 0.5 hours, or 30 minutes, to complete the 360-piece puzzle!

229	One watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30 percent of the watermelons were ready to be harvested, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, with three-quarters of the remaining watermelons ready, she harvested them. How many watermelons were still not ready for harvest after those two weeks?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

I-watermelon efana ne-120 ebizalwa. Ashlyn wahamba efama emva kweminyaka emibili, futhi wabona ukuthi ama-30% ama-watermelon ayiqedi ukuthi ahlule, ke wabaphatha ekhaya. Ngesikhathi esiyindawo eminyaka emithathu, nabaphatha ama-watermelon angu-3/4 angenzi ukuthi ayiqedi, wabaphatha futhi.

Now, let's calculate:

Initially, there were 120 watermelons. After 2 months, 30% were ready, which is 0.3 x 120 = 36 watermelons. Ashlyn took them home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

After 2 weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, which is 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons. Ashlyn harvested them, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

So, 21 watermelons were still not ready for harvest after those two weeks.

230	Marc buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars, then $1,000 more for the registration of each of them. How much does he spend in total?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

12 cars x $20,000 each = $240,000

10% tax on $240,000 = $24,000

Total cost before registration = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Registration for 12 cars = 12 x $1,000 = $12,000

Total amount Marc spends = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

In isiZulu, ""UMarc uyaphakama izimali ezingama-$276,000."" (Marc spends a total of $276,000.)"	276000
231	Kylie and Robert like to go shellfish-picking on the beach. On Monday, Kylie picks up five more shells than Robert picks up twenty. On Tuesday, Kylie picks up twice as many shells as she did on Monday. How many shells did Kylie pick up on Tuesday?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Kylie picks up 5 more shells than Robert, who picks up 20. So Kylie picks up 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie picks up twice as many shells as she did on Monday. That means she picks up 2 x 25 = 50 shells.

So, Kylie picks up 50 shells on Tuesday.

233	There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. A third of them dive and swim in the ocean. Another third go inside the cave to eat their dinner there. How many penguins continue to sunbathe?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the penguins:

36 penguins initially
A third of them dive and swim = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins
Another third go inside the cave = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

Total penguins that left sunbathing = 12 + 12 = 24 penguins

So, the number of penguins that continue to sunbathe is:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

In isiZulu, the answer is: ""Amapengi angama-12 ayasubatha kusasa."" (12 penguins continue to sunbathe.)"	12
234	Steve now wants to eat more tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as many as his girlfriend at the rate of 6 a day. Knowing that a vineyard produces 3 tomatoes a week, how many vines will he need?	21	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola into eyinhloko! (I love getting to the point!)

Let's break it down:

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and he eats twice as many as his girlfriend. So, his girlfriend eats 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes a day.

Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 cherry tomatoes a day.

Since a vineyard produces 3 tomatoes a week, we need to find out how many tomatoes they need in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so they'll eat 9 tomatoes/day × 7 days = 63 tomatoes a week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we'll divide the number of tomatoes they need in a week by the number of tomatoes a vineyard produces in a week:

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

239	The building has three entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. If, after a meeting, 30 percent of the students leave the building through exit A, 3/5 through exit B, and the rest through exit C, calculate the number of students who left the building through exit C.	280	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

30% of students left through exit A, which means 0.3x students left through A.
3/5 of students left through exit B, which means 0.6x students left through B.
The rest left through exit C, which means (1 - 0.3 - 0.6)x = 0.1x students left through C.

Since the total number of students is 100%, we can set up the equation:
0.3x + 0.6x + 0.1x = x

To find the number of students who left through exit C, we need to find 0.1x.

Let's say the total number of students is 100. Then:
0.1x = 0.1(100) = 10

So, 10 students left the building through exit C.

Let's break it down:

John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

Jack has six more candies than Robert, so Jack has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than Jack: 54 - 33 = 21.

John has 21 more candies than Jack.

242	Mike corresponded with five people and then stopped corresponding with two of them. The others each send two five-page letters every week. He answers them the same way. If he can write a page every six minutes, how many hours does he spend writing a week?	3	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Mike corresponds with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of them sends 2 letters with 5 pages each, so Mike receives 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages per week.

He answers them the same way, so he writes 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 x 6 = 180 minutes writing per week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing per week.

243	Jason has a phone plan of 1,000 minutes a month. Every day, he communicates with his boss for 15 minutes, and this month, he spent an additional 300 minutes calling other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate Jason's total minutes used:

Daily minutes used = 15 minutes
Total days in the month = 30 days
Total daily minutes used for the month = 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes
Additional minutes used = 300 minutes
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Jason's remaining minutes = 1,000 minutes (initial plan) - 750 minutes (total used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

244	Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle had. If, in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Griffin had 24 fries initially.
Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
Ginger gave Griffin some fries, let's call it x.
Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so Colby gave 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
Now Griffin has 9 + x + 2 = 11 + x fries.
But in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we set up the equation: 11 + x = 27.
Solving for x, we get x = 16.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 16 fries!

245	There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in another. The difference between the quantities of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?	7	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The difference between the snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is equal to twice the sum of the fish. Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Then, the sum of the fish is 2x.

So, 28 = 2x. Divide both sides by 2, and you get x = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Total cookies consumed by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies consumed by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 x 200 = 9200 calories
