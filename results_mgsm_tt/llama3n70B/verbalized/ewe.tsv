0	Janet cooks 16 eggs a day. Every morning, she eats three of them for breakfast and uses another four to make muffin cakes for friends. She sells the rest every day at the village market, each brown egg for $2. How much does she make (in dollars) a day at the market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet cooks 16 eggs a day.
She eats 3 for breakfast, leaving 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
She uses 4 to make muffin cakes, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes:
9 eggs x $2 = $18

2	Josh got into a home improvement business. He bought it for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. The price of the house went up 150%. How did he find the house?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi (I want to find out) why you're asking about how Josh found the house when the question seems to be about the business and the house's price increase?

However, since you asked, the question doesn't provide enough information about how Josh found the house. Perhaps you could provide more context or clarify the question?

In the meantime, let's focus on the math problem. If Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it, that's a total investment of $130,000. If the price of the house increased by 150%, that means it's now worth $130,000 x 2.5 = $325,000.

4	To maintain the health of her chickens, Wendi feeds them three bowls of baked beans, dried peas, and grass. She feeds them three times a day. In the morning she feeds them fifteen bowls of beans, and in the evening she feeds them twenty-five bowls of beans. If there are twenty chickens in the nest, how many bowls of food will be left over for the rest of the day?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Wendi feeds the chickens 3 times a day, and each time she feeds them 3 bowls of food. So, in total, she feeds them 3 x 3 = 9 bowls of food per day.

In the morning, she feeds them 15 bowls of beans, and in the evening, she feeds them 25 bowls of beans. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 bowls of beans.

Since there are 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 9 bowls of food per day, the total number of bowls needed is 20 x 9 = 180 bowls.

Now, let's subtract the number of bowls already fed from the total number of bowls needed: 180 - 40 = 140 bowls.

Since Wendi feeds them 9 bowls per day, and she's already fed them 40 bowls, the number of bowls left over for the rest of the day is 140 - 40 = 100 bowls.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	100
5	Kylar goes to the store to buy bottles for her new house. One bottle costs $5, and each second bottle is only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 bottles. What will she use to buy them?	64	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love that!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kylar izothenga izibanele zonke ngomakhulu angu-$80.""

Translation: Kylar will buy all the bottles for $80.

Here's the calculation:

1st bottle = $5
2nd bottle = $5 x 0.6 = $3
3rd bottle = $5
4th bottle = $5 x 0.6 = $3
...
16th bottle = $5 x 0.6 = $3

Total cost = 8 x $5 + 8 x $3 = $40 + $24 = $64"	64
6	There are twice as many sheep in Toulouse as there are in Charleston. There are four times as many in Charleston as there are in Seattle. If there are 20 sheep in Seattle, how many sheep are there in Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle combined?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* There are 20 sheep in Seattle.
* There are 4 times as many in Charleston, so 4 x 20 = 80 sheep in Charleston.
* There are 2 times as many in Toulouse, so 2 x 80 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

Now, let's add them up: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep in total.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	260
7	Carla is pulling a 200-gauge windshield. The speed of the training is 20 Gauge per minute; when the material is pulled up to 40%, Windows releases the material so that it resets itself for the insertion of the new material, which takes 20 minutes. This causes Carla to start the training again from the beginning. How long does it take to train a book?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

UCarla uyaphatha igesi elinganiselwa ku-200. Ukukhanya kwesikhathi kukuba ku-20 Gauge ngaminithi; uma imaterial iphakanyiswa ku-40%, iWindows iyisa imaterial ukuthi iyisisele ukuthi ibuyiselwe ekubuyiseleni kwematerial entsha, okuqhubeka iminithi engu-20. Lokhu kucophele ukuthi uCarla aqale ukuthenga kabili.

Now, let's calculate:

1. UCarla uyaphatha igesi elinganiselwa ku-200. (Carla is pulling a 200-gauge windshield.)
2. Ukukhanya kwesikhathi kukuba ku-20 Gauge ngaminithi. (The speed of the training is 20 Gauge per minute.)
3. Uma imaterial iphakanyiswa ku-40%, iWindows iyisa imaterial ukuthi iyisisele ukuthi ibuyiselwe ekubuyiseleni kwematerial entsha. (When the material is pulled up to 40%, Windows releases the material so that it resets itself for the insertion of the new material.)
4. Okuqhubeka iminithi engu-20. (This causes a 20-minute delay.)
5. Lokhu kucophele ukuthi uCarla aqale ukuthenga kabili. (This causes Carla to start the training again from the beginning.)

To find the total time, we need to calculate how many times Carla needs to restart:

200 Gauge / 20 Gauge per minute = 10 minutes to reach 40%
10 minutes / 20 Gauge per minute = 0.5 minutes to reach 40% (first cycle)
0.5 minutes + 20 minutes (delay) = 20.5 minutes (first cycle)
Since Carla needs to restart, she'll need to do this 4 times to reach 200 Gauge:
20.5 minutes x 4 = 82 minutes

So, it will take Carla 82 minutes to train a book."	82

10	A program was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The second month was downloaded three times more than the first month. The third month was downloaded 30%. How many times has the program been downloaded in the last three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 times more than first month = 60 x 3 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% of 180 = 0.3 x 180 = 54 downloads

Total downloads in three months = 60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads

11	Toula purchased three sets of bicycles at an auction for $68 each; two sets of minibikes for $80 each; and six sets of handbags for $55 each.	694	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Three sets of bicycles = 3 x $68 = $204
Two sets of minibikes = 2 x $80 = $160
Six sets of handbags = 6 x $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

12	Carlos wants to plant an apple tree. The price of the field is $90. Each year the tree will produce 7 apples and will sell for $1.5. Watering and feeding the tree costs $3 each. How long will it take Carlos to get the apples on his tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi Carlos uzothola imali yakhe emthini ngani? (I want to find out how long it will take Carlos to get his money back from the tree?)

Let's do the math:

Initial investment = $90 (price of the field)
Annual profit = 7 apples/year × $1.5/apple = $10.50/year
Annual cost = $3 (watering and feeding)

Net annual profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50/year

To find out how long it will take Carlos to get his money back, we can divide the initial investment by the net annual profit:

$90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years

Kusho ukuthi Carlos uzothola imali yakhe emthini ngonyaka we-12. (It means Carlos will get his money back from the tree in 12 years.)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	12
13	Melanie sells door-to-door. When she moves into the basement, she sells a third of her carpet, then sells 2 in the red house and finally sells the remaining half in the blue house. If in all of this she has 5 carpets left, how many carpets did she have at the beginning?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sells 1/3 of her carpet, which means she has 2/3 left.
Then, she sells 2 more, leaving her with 2/3 - 2.
Finally, she sells half of what's remaining, which means she has half of 2/3 - 2 left, which is 5 carpets.

Let's work backwards:

If 5 is half of 2/3 - 2, then 2/3 - 2 = 10.
Adding 2 to both sides, 2/3 = 12.
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get the original number: 36.

So, Melanie had 36 carpets at the beginning!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"	36
14	In a dance school with 20 students, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% in Jazz dance and the rest in Hip-hop. How many students falsely enrolled in hip-hop?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

20% of 20 students = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance
25% of 20 students = 0.25 x 20 = 5 students enrolled in Jazz dance
Total students in contemporary and Jazz = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students enrolled in Hip-hop = 20 - 9 = 11 students

But the question asks how many students ""falsely"" enrolled in Hip-hop. Assuming ""falsely"" means those who didn't actually enroll in Hip-hop, the answer would be:

20 (total students) - 11 (actual Hip-hop students) = 9 students

So, 9 students falsely enrolled in Hip-hop.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	9
15	A merchant is hesitating between two purchases: $5000 worth of jewelry or $8000 worth of art. His business consultant raised the price of jewelry by 2.5% and the price of art by 1.2% in the same month. If the merchant made the right bet that would get him so much money, how much would be in the tree?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the new prices:

Jewelry: $5000 + (2.5% of $5000) = $5000 + $125 = $5125
Art: $8000 + (1.2% of $8000) = $8000 + $96 = $8096

Now, let's find the difference: $8096 - $5125 = $2971

So, if the merchant made the right bet, he would have $2971 more.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Ukuba umuntu akhe amakhono, wayo uma ku $2971!"" (If the person made the right bet, he would have $2971!)"	2971
16	Two trains departed from San Rafael at the same time. They wore sunscreen and traveled 80 Km. The next day they traveled north 150 Km. How much distance did each train travel in these two days?	230	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inkululeko. (Let me help you find the answer.)

Izinhlobo zombili zakhetha ukuthi ziqhakaza ngokufanayo kusasa. (Both trains traveled the same distance.)

Ukusasa lwokuqala, ziqhakaza ngamakhilomitha angu-80. (On the first day, they traveled 80 kilometers.)

Ukusasa olwandule, ziqhakaza ngamakhilomitha angu-150. (On the second day, they traveled 150 kilometers.)

Ukuthola inkululeko, sizokulinganisa amakhilomitha angu-80 ne-150. (To find the answer, we add the 80 kilometers and 150 kilometers.)

Inkululeko iyami: amakhilomitha angu-230. (The answer is: 230 kilometers.)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi uyazi ukuthi izinhlobo zombili zakhetha ukuthi ziqhakaza ngamakhilomitha angu-230 kusasa lwokuqala nesilandule. (I hope you understand that both trains traveled a total distance of 230 kilometers in those two days.)"	230
17	Jill earns $20 an hour as a teacher and $30 an hour as a youth worker. If she works 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a youth worker and works 50 weeks a year, how much does she earn as a wage per year?	57500	"Ehe! (Ah!) Let me calculate that for you!

As a teacher, Jill earns $20/hour and works 35 hours/week, so she earns $20 x 35 = $700/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary as a teacher is $700 x 50 = $35,000/year.

As a youth worker, Jill earns $30/hour and works 15 hours/week, so she earns $30 x 15 = $450/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary as a youth worker is $450 x 50 = $22,500/year.

Adding both salaries together, Jill earns $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year.

In Yoruba, I'd say: ""Owo re yi, Jill ngba $57,500 ni odun!"" (This is Jill's money, she earns $57,500 per year!)"	57500
18	For her breakfast, Claire roasts 3 eggs every morning. How many egg yolks will she eat in four weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Translation:
Hello!

I want to say that Claire eats 6 eggs per week, and if we start with 6 being 3, it means 3*7 = 21 per week. If we start with 4 weeks, it means 21*4 = 84. But egg yolks are 2, so it means 84/2 = 42."	42
19	Mirassa walked on a farm road for 12 KM. He walked the first 4 KM in 1 hour, then another 2 KM in 1 hour. If he wanted his speed to be 4 KM per hour, what would be his speed (in miles per hour) for the rest of the journey?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mirassa walked 4 KM in 1 hour, so his speed was 4 KM/h.
He walked another 2 KM in 1 hour, so his speed was still 2 KM/h.

He has 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 KM left to walk.

To maintain an average speed of 4 KM/h, he needs to cover the remaining 6 KM in:

6 KM / 4 KM/h = 1.5 hours

Now, to find his speed in miles per hour, we need to convert kilometers to miles:

1 KM = 0.621371 miles (approximately)

So, 4 KM/h ≈ 2.485 miles/h

To cover the remaining 6 KM in 1.5 hours, his speed needs to be:

6 KM / 1.5 hours ≈ 4 KM/h ≈ 2.485 miles/h

Therefore, his speed for the rest of the journey should be approximately 2.485 miles per hour.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50 with a 25% discount on the total book sales. How much was the total book sales?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total book sales.

If Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a 25% discount, that means the discount amount is 25% of the total book sales.

Let's call the total book sales ""x"".

The discount amount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x.

The amount Kyle paid is the total book sales minus the discount amount: x - 0.25x = 19.50

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.75x = 19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get: x = 26.00

So, the total book sales were $26.00.

25	Marie sent a chicken for $12; 5 milk cartons for $3 each; 4 slices sold for $1.5 each; and some pizza boxes. Marie paid $50 in total. If the pizza boxes cost $8.50, how many pizzas did Marie send?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the costs:

* Chicken: $12
* 5 milk cartons: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 slices: 4 x $1.5 = $6
* Total so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
* Remaining amount: $50 - $33 = $17
* Pizza boxes: $8.50
* Remaining amount after pizza boxes: $17 - $8.50 = $8.50
* Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie sent 1 pizza box.

Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

3 shirts x $42 = $126
3 trousers x $22.50 = $67.50

29	While shopping for shoes, Gloria found a pair of shoes that fit her shoe size. However, the shoes had to be paired with two other shoes that cost five dollars less each. If the first shoe cost $33 and the second was twice as much, how much would the shoe cost in dollars?	104	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The first shoe costs $33.
The second shoe costs twice as much, so it's $33 x 2 = $66.
The two other shoes cost $5 less each, so they cost $66 - $5 = $61 each.
To find the total cost, add the prices of all three shoes: $33 + $61 + $61 = $155.

So, the total cost of the shoes is $155."	155
30	If Darell and Allen now have a combined score of 162, how many points is Allen behind by 10?	109	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If they have a combined score of 162 and Allen is behind by 10 points, that means Darell's score is 10 more than Allen's score. Let's call Allen's score ""x"". Then, Darell's score is x + 10.

We know that their combined score is 162, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) = 162.

Combine like terms: 2x + 10 = 162.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 152.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 76.

So, Allen's score is 76. And Darell's score is 76 + 10 = 86.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"	86

33	Gretchen has 110 precious stones. The gold stones are 30 times more valuable than the silver stones. How many gold stones does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ibhasari. (Let me help you with that.)

Ukuthola ukuthi izitshi zaseGretchen zonke ziyisi-110. (We know Gretchen has 110 precious stones in total.)

Kuthiwa amastone angold ayivaliwe ku-30 times amasilver. (It's said the gold stones are 30 times more valuable than the silver stones.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-10. (I think Gretchen has 10 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 10 x 30 = 300 (silver stones) + 10 (gold stones) = 310. (I want to check: 10 x 30 = 300 silver stones + 10 gold stones = 310.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-3.5. (I think Gretchen has 3.5 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 3.5 x 30 = 105 (silver stones) + 3.5 (gold stones) = 108.5. (I want to check: 3.5 x 30 = 105 silver stones + 3.5 gold stones = 108.5.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong again.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-3. (I think Gretchen has 3 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 3 x 30 = 90 (silver stones) + 3 (gold stones) = 93. (I want to check: 3 x 30 = 90 silver stones + 3 gold stones = 93.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong again.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-3.08. (I think Gretchen has 3.08 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 3.08 x 30 = 92.4 (silver stones) + 3.08 (gold stones) = 95.48. (I want to check: 3.08 x 30 = 92.4 silver stones + 3.08 gold stones = 95.48.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong again.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-3.07. (I think Gretchen has 3.07 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 3.07 x 30 = 92.1 (silver stones) + 3.07 (gold stones) = 95.17. (I want to check: 3.07 x 30 = 92.1 silver stones + 3.07 gold stones = 95.17.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong again.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amastone angold aGretchen ayi-3.066. (I think Gretchen has 3.066 gold stones.)

Ngifisa ukuthola ukuthi: 3.066 x 30 = 91.98 (silver stones) + 3.066 (gold stones) = 95.03. (I want to check: 3.066 x 30 = 91.98 silver stones + 3.066 gold stones = 95.03.)

Kodwa ukuthola ukuthi Gretchen unastone ayi-110, akusho ukuthi anginika. (But we know Gretchen has 110 stones, so my calculation is wrong again.)

34	Aaron's bracelets are 2 times smaller than Siobhan's. Aaron's are half the size of Raymond's and 5 times smaller than Raymond's. If there are 40 of Raymond's, how many of Siobhan's would there be?	23	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Aaron's bracelets are 2 times smaller than Siobhan's, so Siobhan's are 2 times bigger than Aaron's.
* Aaron's bracelets are half the size of Raymond's, so Raymond's are 2 times bigger than Aaron's.
* Aaron's bracelets are 5 times smaller than Raymond's, so Raymond's are 5 times bigger than Aaron's.
* There are 40 of Raymond's bracelets.

Since Aaron's are half the size of Raymond's, Aaron's would be 40 / 2 = 20.
Since Siobhan's are 2 times bigger than Aaron's, Siobhan's would be 20 x 2 = 40.

So, there would be 40 of Siobhan's bracelets.

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike played 4 holes.

In the remaining 20 minutes, he played 25% more holes. To find 25% of 4, multiply 4 by 0.25, which gives you 1. So, he played 4 + 1 = 5 holes in the remaining 20 minutes.

In total, Mike played 4 + 5 = 9 holes.

36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. 4 yogurts sell for $5.00. How much money does he make for yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since 4 yogurts sell for $5.00, we can find the price of 1 yogurt:
$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, let's calculate how much money Terry makes in 30 days:
60 yogurts × $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

So, Terry makes $75.00 in 30 days from selling yogurts.

37	Jean wants to sell all her toys and buy a video game. She has 13 Lego sets, each worth $15. In the end, she buys 8 video games, each worth $20, leaving her with $5. How many Lego sets does she have left?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean has 13 Lego sets, each worth $15, so she has 13 x $15 = $195.

She buys 8 video games, each worth $20, so she spends 8 x $20 = $160.

She has $195 - $160 = $35 left, but she's left with $5, so she must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 more.

She spent $30 on Lego sets, and each set is $15, so she sold 30 / 15 = 2 Lego sets.

She had 13 Lego sets initially, so she has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

39	A zebra runs four times faster than it walks; however, its speed is twice as slow as its running speed. If its running speed is 3 Km per hour, how many Km can it do in an hour when it spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Running speed = 3 km/h
Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 3 km/h / 4 = 0.75 km/h

Time spent running = 1/3 hour
Time spent walking = 2/3 hour

Distance covered while running = Running speed x Time spent running = 3 km/h x 1/3 h = 1 km
Distance covered while walking = Walking speed x Time spent walking = 0.75 km/h x 2/3 h = 0.5 km

Total distance covered in 1 hour = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 1 km + 0.5 km = 1.5 km

So, the zebra can cover 1.5 km in an hour when it spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking.

Let's break it down:

Suzie's iPhone costs 1.
Ben's iPhone is twice as old, so it costs 1 x 2 = 2.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so it costs 2 x 4 = 8.

So, Brandon's iPhone costs 8.

43	According to nutritionists, one tablespoon contains 250 calories per serving. If there are 5 tablespoons of 300 calories per serving, how many tablespoons would you eat if your daily goal was to get 2000 calories instead of 1800 calories?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola ukuthi ukudla okuningi kwethu kukubalwa ngokucopheleleyo. (Let me help you calculate the amount of food you need.)

Ukuba ukudla okungenani kwethu kukuba 2000 calories, futhi ukudla okungenani okwesikhathi sesikhathi kukuba 1800 calories, kuthiwa ukudla okungenani okufanele kukuba 200 calories ngaphezu kwesikhathi sesikhathi. (If our daily goal is 2000 calories, and our usual daily intake is 1800 calories, then we need an additional 200 calories.)

Ukuba ukudla okungenani kwethu kukuba 1 tablespoon kwaba 250 calories, kuthiwa ukudla okungenani okufanele kukuba 200 calories / 250 calories per tablespoon = 0.8 tablespoons. (If 1 tablespoon contains 250 calories, then we need 200 calories / 250 calories per tablespoon = 0.8 tablespoons.)

Ngakho, ukudla okungenani okufanele kukuba 0.8 tablespoons + 5 tablespoons = 5.8 tablespoons. (So, we need 0.8 tablespoons + 5 tablespoons = 5.8 tablespoons.)

45	Mérédith is a freelance journalist and her job is to write a book on topics related to health and put it in her handbag every day. A book on a topic takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. The next week, she writes 5 books a day and on Tuesday she does 2/5 more. On Wednesday, she writes twice as much as the immortal. Consider how many hours she spent writing the books of the last three days.	104	"Nkɛ́ nwɛ́! (That's ""Let's go!"" in Lingala, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo.)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Monday: Mérédith writes 5 books, and each book takes 4 hours to research and write. So, she spends 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing.

Tuesday: She writes 2/5 more than Monday, which means she writes 5 + (2/5) x 5 = 7 books. She spends 7 x 4 = 28 hours writing.

Wednesday: She writes twice as much as Tuesday, which means she writes 2 x 7 = 14 books. She spends 14 x 4 = 56 hours writing.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent writing over the last three days: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

Let's break it down:

Candide started with 80 cards.
He bought another bag, so we'll call the number of cards in that bag ""x"".
He placed 1 card on each of 220 cups, so he used 220 cards.
He was left with 23 cards.

47	Jean bought red collars twice as much as blue collars. Red collars are 50% more expensive. She spent $200 for blue collars that cost $40 each. What did she spend on buying collars?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean spent $200 on blue collars that cost $40 each, so she bought:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue collars

Since she bought red collars twice as much as blue collars, she bought:

5 x 2 = 10 red collars

Red collars are 50% more expensive, so each red collar costs:

$40 x 1.5 = $60

She spent on red collars:

10 x $60 = $600

In total, she spent:

$200 (blue) + $600 (red) = $800

Ukucopheleleyo, Tracy wayesebenzisa ichain elingama-9 amafuthe, elashiywa ngamasenti ayisixhenxe. (Initially, Tracy used a 9-foot-long chain, which was shortened by 6 inches.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi amafuthe ayisixhenxe angama-0.5 amafuthe. (I think 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.)

Ngakho ichain elingama-9 amafuthe lashiya ngamasenti ayisixhenxe, lishiywe ngama-0.5 amafuthe. (So the 9-foot-long chain, shortened by 6 inches, was shortened by 0.5 feet.)

Ichain elingama-8.5 amafuthe liyachitha. (The chain is now 8.5 feet long.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi Tracy wayengachitha ichain elingama-1.5 amafuthe. (I think Tracy managed to cut 1.5 feet of chain.)

Kepha ngicabanga ukuthi Tracy wayengachitha amachain amane angama-3, ngoba amafuthe ayisithupha. (But I think Tracy managed to cut 3 short chains, because 1.5 feet is equal to 3 chains of 0.5 feet each.)

Let's break it down:

There are 8 seats on each floor, and Richard is on the 15th floor, so there are 8 seats on the 15th floor.

Three-fourths of 8 is 6 (3/4 × 8 = 6). If 6 seats are occupied, that means 2 seats are vacant (8 - 6 = 2).

So, are there 6 vacancies? Ah, ah, no! (That's ""No"" in Igbo.) There are only 2 vacancies."	2

51	Tom's boat has a speed of 10 Km per hour. He boarded from 1 pm to 4 pm and turned back when the speed was 6 Km per hour. How long will it take him to get home?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Tom traveled from 1 pm to 4 pm, which is 3 hours. His speed was 10 km/h, so he covered a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 km/h x 3 hours = 30 km

Now, he's turning back, and his speed is 6 km/h. To find the time it'll take him to get home, we'll use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 30 km / 6 km/h = 5 hours

So, it'll take Tom 5 hours to get home.

52	Uriah's bag was too heavy for him to carry. He had to reduce its weight by 15 Kg. Each of his magic books weighed 1/4 pound and his toy, isa added 1/2 pound. If he removed 30 magic books from the bag, how many toys would he have added?	15	"Ndi Igbo! O di kwa mma!

Let's break it down:

Uriah wants to reduce the weight by 15 Kg. Since 1 Kg = 2.20462 pounds, 15 Kg = 15 x 2.20462 = 33.0693 pounds.

Each magic book weighs 1/4 pound, so removing 30 magic books reduces the weight by 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

The toy, Isa, adds 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah added, we'll subtract the weight reduced by the magic books from the total weight reduction:

33.0693 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 25.5693 pounds

Now, divide the remaining weight by the weight added by each toy:

25.5693 pounds ÷ 0.5 pounds/toy = 51.1386 toys

So, Uriah would have added 51 toys.

Stéphane himself gave a bottle of water $4.00. If we add the fees, how much of the entire bill did Stéphane get?	57	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* The bill of lading showed $40.00.
* The bartender added 25% of $40.00, which is $10.00 (25% of 40 is 10).
* The bartender also added a $3.00 fee, making the total additional fee $13.00 ($10.00 + $3.00).
* Stéphane gave a bottle of water worth $4.00.

To find the total amount Stéphane got, we add the original bill and the additional fees: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Then, we subtract the cost of the bottle of water: $53.00 - $4.00 = $49.00.

So, Stéphane got $49.00.

* 25 fish are in a basket.
* One is broken, so 24 are left.
* 25% are bad, which is 25/100 × 24 = 6 bad fish.
* Two are healthy, so the rest are healthy too.
* 24 - 6 - 2 = 16 healthy fish.

61	Janet bought her daughter a shower cap. She spent $500 on the equipment, paid $800 to the doctor who did the surgery. Then she paid 10% of the same amount for the safety of the shower cap. How much did she spend in total?	1430	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* She spent $500 on the equipment.
* She paid $800 to the doctor.
* She paid 10% of $800 for the safety of the shower cap, which is $80 (10% of $800).

Total amount spent = $500 + $800 + $80 = $1380.

62	If Marcy worked for only one company for 40 years, her annual salary would be $50,000. From 20 years of work, she would receive 5% of this salary each year. If she worked for 30 years before quitting, what would her annual salary be?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Ukuthola ukuphuma kwemali yakhe, sizokubheka ukuthi uma eyisebenza iminyaka eyi-20, wayothola 5% yalemali yakhe ngemnyaka. 5% yalemali yakhe yi-$50,000, kuyinto yi-$2,500 ngemnyaka. Uma eyisebenza iminyaka eyi-30, kuthiwa wayothola 30/20 x $2,500 = $3,750 ngemnyaka. Kepha, uma esebenzayo iminyaka eyi-30, kuthiwa isala lakhe liyi-$50,000 + $3,750 = $53,750 ngemnyaka.

(To find her salary, let's see that if she worked for 20 years, she would receive 5% of her salary per year. 5% of her salary is $50,000, which is $2,500 per year. If she worked for 30 years, it means she would receive 30/20 x $2,500 = $3,750 per year. But, if she worked for 30 years, her salary would be $50,000 + $3,750 = $53,750 per year.)"	53750
63	Aleena signed up for a wind turbine exhibition for which she paid $140 a month. If the wind turbine company charged her this fee in the first half of the year and reduced it by 10% in the second half of the year, imagine what she would pay in one year.	1596	"Nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140/month, so she paid a total of:
$140/month × 6 months = $840

In the second half of the year, the fee was reduced by 10%, so the new monthly fee is:
$140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126/month

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $126/month, so she paid a total of:
$126/month × 6 months = $756

In one year, Aleena paid a total of:
$840 + $756 = $1,596

So, Aleena would pay $1,596 in one year.

64	Sophie is thinking about traveling and wondering where she can go with a car that will only change oil once. She has traveled 100 Km since the oil leak occurred and had to have 4 gallons of oil added. The car's registration indicates that her car takes 12 gallons of oil to run. How many kilometers can Sophie do if she only changes oil once?	300	"Jambo! (Hello!)

In Swahili, I'll answer your question: ""Kwa kuongeza mafuta, Sophie anahitaji kufanya km ngapi kwa mafuta moja tu?""

Let's calculate:

Initially, Sophie's car had 12 gallons of oil. After traveling 100 km, 4 gallons were added, which means 12 - 4 = 8 gallons were left.

Now, to find out how many kilometers Sophie can travel with the remaining oil, we'll divide the remaining oil by the oil consumption rate.

Oil consumption rate = Total oil capacity / Total distance = 12 gallons / x km

Since 4 gallons were added after 100 km, the oil consumption rate is:

4 gallons / 100 km = 0.04 gallons/km

Now, let's find the total distance Sophie can travel with the remaining 8 gallons:

x km = 8 gallons / 0.04 gallons/km = 200 km

So, Sophie can travel an additional 200 km with the remaining oil.

In Swahili, ""Sophie anaweza kusafiri km 200 kwa mafuta moja tu!"" (Sophie can travel 200 km with one oil change only!)"	200
65	Jim spends 2 hours on the telescope and now spends half of that time reading and watching. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he have to watch and read on the telescope in 4 weeks?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours on the telescope, and now spends half of that time reading and watching. Half of 2 hours is 1 hour.

He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 1 hour x 3 times = 3 hours per week.

In 4 weeks, he will spend 3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours.

So, Jim will have 12 hours to watch and read on the telescope in 4 weeks.

66	There are four schools that have qualified for a basketball tournament. Each school has qualified a women's team and a men's team with five members each. Each school has also sent one coach to the tournament. How many people have all the schools sent to the tournament?	48	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's count the number of people each school has sent:

* 1 women's team with 5 members = 5 people
* 1 men's team with 5 members = 5 people

(Translation: I want to find out how much money Bailey had before she received $5 a week for 8 weeks. If after those 8 weeks, Bailey's total amount of money was $100, I want to find out how much money Bailey had before receiving the $5.)

Let's calculate:

Bailey received $5 a week for 8 weeks, so she received a total of $5 x 8 = $40.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100.

To find out how much money Bailey had at the beginning, we subtract the $40 she received from the $100 she had at the end:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey had $60 at the beginning.

What would be the same width of the loft if he built a 4-storey loft and the width of the last floor was 16 meters on peids?	60	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Each floor takes half the width of the previous floor.
* The last floor (4th floor) has a width of 16 meters.
* To find the width of the 3rd floor, we multiply 16 by 2, which gives us 32 meters.
* To find the width of the 2nd floor, we multiply 32 by 2, which gives us 64 meters.
* To find the width of the 1st floor, we multiply 64 by 2, which gives us 128 meters.

So, the width of the 4-storey loft is 128 meters.

76	Cécilia has now bought a puppy. Her veterinarian told her that she should feed it 1 bowl of dog food a day for 180 days. Now, she will feed it 2 bowl a day for the rest of her life. If there are 110 bowl of food in one bowl, how many bowl of food will she use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. For 180 days, Cécilia will feed the puppy 1 bowl of dog food a day. That's 180 bowls.
2. Since there are 110 bowls of food in one bowl, she'll use 180 x 110 = 19,800 bowls of food in the first 180 days.

Now, let's calculate the number of bowls she'll use for the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days):

3. She'll feed the puppy 2 bowls a day for 185 days, which is 2 x 185 = 370 bowls.
4. Since there are 110 bowls of food in one bowl, she'll use 370 x 110 = 40,700 bowls of food for the rest of the year.

Adding the two amounts, Cécilia will use a total of 19,800 + 40,700 = 60,500 bowls of food in the first year.

78	Vincent had the option of buying 3 packs of flowers for $ 2.50 or buying 2 packs of flowers for $ 1. How much would he save if he bought 18 flowers at the right price ?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

If Vincent buys 3 packs for $2.50, the cost per pack is $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83 per pack.

If he buys 2 packs for $1, the cost per pack is $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per pack.

To buy 18 packs, Vincent would need to buy 6 sets of 3 packs (6 × 3 = 18). At $2.50 per 3 packs, the total cost would be 6 × $2.50 = $15.

Alternatively, he could buy 9 sets of 2 packs (9 × 2 = 18). At $1 per 2 packs, the total cost would be 9 × $1 = $9.

By buying 18 packs at the right price ($9), Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $6.

The question seems to be a bit confusing, as it mentions a dog and a dry cleaner, but then asks about the cost of a house.

However, if we assume that the $100 is the rent for the house, and the dry cleaner deducts 30% from it, that means the dry cleaner deducts $30 (30% of $100).

80	Two girls each draw one-sixth of a quart of water, and one boy draws six quarts of a quart. How many quarts of water are left?	10	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 quart = 4 cups
* Each girl draws 1/6 of a quart, which is 1/6 × 4 cups = 2/3 cup
* Since there are two girls, they draw a total of 2 × 2/3 cup = 4/3 cup = 1 1/3 cups
* The boy draws 6 quarts, which is 6 × 4 cups = 24 cups
* Initially, there was 1 quart = 4 cups
* Subtracting the water drawn by the girls and the boy, we get:
4 cups - 1 1/3 cups - 24 cups = -21 1/3 cups

Since we can't have a negative amount of water, it means the initial amount of water was not enough to fulfill their needs. Let's assume there was enough water initially. In that case, we can calculate the remaining water:

* The girls and the boy drew a total of 1 1/3 cups + 24 cups = 25 1/3 cups
* Since there are 4 cups in a quart, we can convert the total drawn to quarts: 25 1/3 cups ÷ 4 cups/quart = 6 1/6 quarts
* Subtracting this from the initial amount (let's assume it was more than 6 1/6 quarts), we get:
? quarts - 6 1/6 quarts =? quarts

The answer depends on the initial amount of water. If there were 10 quarts initially, for example, there would be:

10 quarts - 6 1/6 quarts = 3 5/6 quarts

85	Gene collects old souvenirs in a red suit. He has a souvenir suit for each day of his vacation. Each suit is the square root of the width of the suit. The square root of the width of each suit is the square root of its height. Since he was twenty-three yards, he traveled four times a mile. Now he has thirty-four yards. How many square yards does his suit have?	44	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola into eyinhloko! (I love solving puzzles!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gene travels 4 times a mile, which is 4 × 1760 yards = 7040 yards.
2. He starts with 23 yards and travels 7040 yards, so he ends up with 23 + 7040 = 7063 yards.
3. Now, he has 34 yards, which means he gave away 7063 - 34 = 7029 yards.
4. Each souvenir suit has a width equal to its square root, and a height equal to its square root as well. This means the width and height are equal.
5. Since Gene gave away 7029 yards, and each suit has a width and height equal to its square root, we can set up the equation:

Width = √7029 ≈ 84 yards

6. Since the width and height are equal, the area of each suit is:

Area = Width × Height = 84 × 84 = 7056 square yards

So, Gene's suit has approximately 7056 square yards.

88	Marilyn's first single sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If the two of them sold 88,000 records, how many of them were Harald's?	8000	"Ehe, ngiwa kuwe! (Ah, I understand!)

Let's break it down, my friend. If Marilyn's single sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, that means if Harald sold x records, Marilyn sold 10x records. Since they sold a total of 88,000 records, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 records.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Harald wasola amarekodi angu-8,000!"" (Harald sold 8,000 records!)"	8000
89	Christina planned to have a memorial service, and 0.75 cups were needed for each invitation and 1/4 of the invitations did not come. When she invited 16 people and each cup cost $2, how many cups would she use?	24	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) 

Let's break it down:

Christina invited 16 people, but 1/4 of them didn't come. That means 16 x 1/4 = 4 people didn't come. So, 16 - 4 = 12 people came.

Each invitation needs 0.75 cups, and 12 people came. So, she'll need 12 x 0.75 = 9 cups.

Since each cup costs $2, she'll spend 9 x $2 = $18.

Answer: 9 cups."	9
90	Ted Tyrannosaure decides to take a potato salad to the big meat dinners. He knows that each adult will need 10 Kg and the children half this weight. If 20 adults and 5 children come to the party, how many kilograms of salad will be prepared if everyone eats it?	225	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Uma abantu abadala 20 bangafuna i-10kg nganye, kuyafana ukuthi bangafuna i-200kg. (If 20 adults need 10kg each, that means they need 200kg.)

Abantwana 5 bangafuna i-5kg nganye, kuyafana ukuthi bangafuna i-25kg. (If 5 children need 5kg each, that means they need 25kg.)

Ngakho, uTed uyafuna ukupakisha isaladi esingama-kg angu-225. (So, Ted wants to prepare 225kg of salad.)

91	Jan has three times as many rabbits as Marcia. Marcia has twice as many rabbits as Cindy. If Cindy has four rabbits, how many rabbits does she have in total?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Cindy has 4 rabbits.
Marcia has twice as many as Cindy, so Marcia has 2 x 4 = 8 rabbits.
Jan has three times as many as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 8 = 24 rabbits.

In total, they have 4 + 8 + 24 = 36 rabbits.

92	Emilie has four children: Amy, Jackson, Corey and Jacques. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If Jacques is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year old, how many years old is Jackson?	4	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo! (I love solving puzzles!)

Let's break it down:

* Corey is 1 year old.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 1 - 2 = -1 years old (but that's not possible, so we'll come back to this).
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is Amy - 5 years old.
* Jacques is 10 years old, but that doesn't help us with Jackson's age.

Let's rethink this:

* Corey is 1 year old.
* Amy is 2 years older than Jacques, so Amy is 10 + 2 = 12 years old.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

So, Jackson is 7 years old.

93	Lee used to beat Gérald by two minutes in the 400-meter dash, but after changing his diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee ran the 400-meter dash in 38 laps, how long would Gérald have to run after the change in diet?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee runs 400m in 38 seconds. Gérald is 2 minutes (120 seconds) slower, so Gérald's original time is 38 + 120 = 158 seconds.

After improving by 10%, Gérald's new time is 158 / 1.1 = 143.64 seconds.

So, Gérald would have to run for approximately 144 seconds after changing his diet.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you)!"	144

95	Of the 200 students in the sixth grade, two-fifths are boys and two-thirds are girls. How many girls are not girls?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Two-fifths of 200 students are boys, so that's 2/5 × 200 = 80 boys.
* Two-thirds of 200 students are girls, so that's 2/3 × 200 = 133.33 (let's round to 133 girls, since we can't have a fraction of a student).

Now, the question asks how many girls are not girls. That's a trick question! The answer is zero, because all girls are girls!

96	Harry slept for 9 hours last night. He woke Jacques for only 2/3 of the time. How many hours did Harry sleep compared to Jacques?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down: Harry slept for 9 hours. Jacques was awake for 2/3 of that time. To find the time Jacques was awake, multiply 9 hours by 2/3: 9 × 2/3 = 6 hours.

So, Harry slept 9 hours, and Jacques was awake for 6 hours. To find the difference, subtract: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 hours more than Jacques.

Let's break it down:

Poppy places a quarter of the 1,000 tiles, which is 1,000 ÷ 4 = 250 tiles.

That leaves 1,000 - 250 = 750 tiles remaining.

The mother places a third of the remaining tiles, which is 750 ÷ 3 = 250 tiles.

She takes 16 minutes to reach twenty meters, while the raft takes 64 minutes to travel. How many liters of water did Julia have before she reached the top of the waterfall?	16	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Julia ithola amaliti ayi-2 ngosuku olu-10. (Julia reaches 2 liters every 10 meters.)
Iminithi ayi-16 ithola amametha ayi-20. (It takes 16 minutes to reach 20 meters.)
Isivinini sisithola isikhathi esiyi-64. (The raft takes 64 minutes to travel.)

Now, let's calculate:

If Julia reaches 2 liters every 10 meters, and it takes 16 minutes to reach 20 meters, then she reaches 4 liters in 16 minutes (2 liters/10 meters × 20 meters).

The raft takes 64 minutes to travel. Since Julia reaches 4 liters in 16 minutes, she will reach 16 liters in 64 minutes (4 liters/16 minutes × 64 minutes).

So, Julia had 16 liters of water before she reached the top of the waterfall.

115	Some time after purchasing timber for construction, Sasha noticed that the price of the timber had increased by 50% over the previous months. She now agreed to sell her remaining timber. 10 blocks of 2x4x10 lengths remained, and she bought each one for $10. She had five blocks of 4x4x10 lengths and her purchase price was $16 each. If she could sell them all, how much would it cost?	90	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the selling price of the timber.

For the 2x4x10 blocks:
Sasha bought 10 blocks at $10 each, so her total cost is 10 x $10 = $100.
Since the price increased by 50%, the new price is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 per block.
The total selling price for the 2x4x10 blocks is 10 x $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 blocks:
Sasha bought 5 blocks at $16 each, so her total cost is 5 x $16 = $80.
Since the price increased by 50%, the new price is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 per block.
The total selling price for the 4x4x10 blocks is 5 x $24 = $120.

116	Katy is making coffee and is measuring the water with a sugar spoon and a cup; the ratio of the spoon to the cup is 7:13. If the total consumption is 120 cups, calculate how many cups of sugar she has used.	42	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. The ratio of spoon to cup is 7:13, so for every 13 cups, Katy uses 7 spoons of sugar. To find the total spoons of sugar used, we can set up a proportion:

7 spoons / 13 cups = x spoons / 120 cups

Cross-multiply and solve for x:

x = (7 × 120) / 13
x = 840 / 13
x = 64.62 (round up to 65, since you can't have a fraction of a spoon)

So, Katy has used approximately 65 spoons of sugar.

118	An employee at the Seaside port counted 2 containers of cargo ships with 5 cars each. The next day, more containers arrived and the total number of ships at the port was now 30. Count the number of containers that arrived the next day if there were 5 cars each.	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 cars each, so there were 2 x 5 = 10 cars.

The next day, the total number of cars became 30. To find the number of containers that arrived, we'll subtract the initial number of cars from the total:

30 (total cars) - 10 (initial cars) = 20 new cars

Since each container has 5 cars, we'll divide the number of new cars by 5:

20 (new cars) ÷ 5 = 4 new containers

So, 4 containers arrived the next day.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"	4
119	Adrien's one-year salary was 30% more than Lylah's. After four years, her salary was increased by 40% more than her previous salary. If Lylah's salary was also increased at the same time and Adrien was initially earning $40,000, how much money would they both have after four years?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Adrien's initial salary was $40,000. Lylah's salary was 30% less, so:

Lylah's initial salary = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769

After four years, Adrien's salary remained the same, so he earned:

Adrien's total = 4 x $40,000 = $160,000

Lylah's salary increased by 40%, so her new salary was:

Lylah's new salary = $30,769 x 1.4 = $43,076

Her total earnings over four years were:

Lylah's total = 3 x $30,769 + $43,076 = $159,352

Together, they earned:

Total = $160,000 + $159,352 = $319,352

121	Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruit. Morisette brought five bundles and eight skins, while Kael brought twice as many bundles and half as many skins. How many fruits did they bring in total?	27	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Morisette brought 5 bundles and 8 skins.
Kael brought twice as many bundles, so 2 x 5 = 10 bundles.
Kael brought half as many skins, so 8 / 2 = 4 skins.

In total, they brought 5 + 10 = 15 bundles and 8 + 4 = 12 skins.

There are now thirty cards in all. How many cards were used to build the wheel before Jennie got sick?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Jennie was given 60 sets of cards. She used 1/3 of them to build the wheel. 1/3 of 60 is 20. After building, there were 30 cards left. So, 60 - 30 = 30 cards were used in total. Since Jennie used 20, that means 30 - 20 = 10 cards were used before she got sick.

How many bags did Julia buy?	10	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Julia used 3 bags in the kitchen, and she had 12 bags left. So, she had 12 + 3 = 15 bags initially.

In Yoruba, a Nigerian language, we could say: ""Oriki Lily ni 50, sugbon a ki mo ọrọ Amy, a ko mo ọrọ wọn gbogbo."" (Lily has 50 friends, but we don't know Amy's friends, so we don't know their total friends.)"	50
128	Well's mother sells pastas, apples and peaches at a street market. One pastas costs three times as much as an apple and one peach costs 5 times less than a peach. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 pastas, 20 apples and 10 peaches. How much would they use if a peach costs $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 1 pasta costs 3 times as much as an apple, so if x is the cost of an apple, then 3x is the cost of a pasta.
* 1 peach costs 5 times less than a pasta, so the cost of a peach is 3x/5.
* Given that a peach costs $15, we can set up the equation: 3x/5 = 15.
* Solving for x, we get x = $25 (cost of an apple).
* So, the cost of a pasta is 3x = $75.
* Now, let's calculate the total cost:
	+ 4 pastas = 4 x $75 = $300
	+ 20 apples = 20 x $25 = $500
	+ 10 peaches = 10 x $15 = $150
	Total cost = $300 + $500 + $150 = $950

Ukubonga ukuthi abantu abayizi-3 bawufunda ekuseni, kufanele sithole ukuthi abantu abayizi-3 bawufunda ekuseni ngemuva kokuba bavunyelwe abantwana.

Pam climbed the Russian mountains 2 times, so she used 2 x 2 = 4 tickets (2 tickets for going up and 2 tickets for coming down).

In total, they used 4 + 8 = 12 tickets that day.

133	Walt walked 4 miles on Tuesday. It's 6 times faster than Tuesday. His mileage from Tuesday to Thursday is 41 miles. How many miles did they walk on Tuesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Walt walked 4 miles on Tuesday, and it's 6 times faster on Thursday. That means on Thursday, Walt walked 4 x 6 = 24 miles. 

The total mileage from Tuesday to Thursday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday, we subtract Thursday's mileage from the total: 41 - 24 = 17 miles. 

However, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Tuesday, but that's not the correct answer. The problem states Walt walked 4 miles on Tuesday, but it's 6 times faster on Thursday. This means the 4 miles is actually the Thursday mileage, not Tuesday's. 

So, to find Tuesday's mileage, we divide Thursday's mileage by 6: 4 ÷ 6 = 2/3 miles.

137	Rory sent 2 vans for $7.50 each, 2 fries for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. He paid 20% of the fare, and Rory gave $5.00 to a helper. How much did the truck cost?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

2 vans for $7.50 each = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 fries for $1.50 each = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Rory paid 20% of the fare, which is $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
He gave $5.00 to a helper, so the total amount paid is $4.00 + $5.00 = $9.00

To find the cost of the truck, we subtract the amount paid from the total cost:
$20.00 - $9.00 = $11.00

So, the truck cost $11.00.

Let's break it down:

* There are 12 blue dots.
* There are 22 times more blue dots than 4 times more pink dots.
* Let's say the number of pink dots is x.
* Then, 4 times more pink dots is 4x.
* Since there are 22 times more blue dots than 4x, we can set up the equation: 12 = 22(4x)
* Simplify the equation: 12 = 88x
* Divide both sides by 88: x = 12/88
* x = 3/22

So, there are 3/22 pink dots. Since you can't have a fraction of a dot, we can assume it's 1 pink dot."	1

141	An octopus is seven hundred octopuses, which is twice as many octopuses as males and females. How many octopuses do you have?	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* ""An octopus is seven hundred octopuses"" means we have a total of 700 octopuses.
* ""which is twice as many octopuses as males and females"" means the total number of octopuses is twice the number of males and females combined.

Let's assume the number of males and females combined is x. Then, the total number of octopuses is 2x.

We know the total number of octopuses is 700, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 700

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 350

So, there are 350 males and 350 females, making a total of 700 octopuses!

How many octopuses do Debra see in cages in the last six hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* In the first 6 hours, 30 octopuses come out.
* In the next 6 hours, an average number return, which means the same number that came out, so 30 return.
* In the next 6 hours, twice as many octopuses leave as the first time, so 2 x 30 = 60 octopuses leave.
* 8 octopuses that didn't come and go are back in cages in the last 6 hours.

Now, let's count the total number of octopuses Debra sees in cages in the last 6 hours:

* 30 returned in the second 6 hours
* 8 that didn't come and go are back in cages
* Total = 30 + 8 = 38

So, Debra sees 38 octopuses in cages in the last 6 hours of the day.

151	Shawnda decided that a bicycle repair shop would be a good idea for the children in his village. He started charging them 25 cents for a pair of bicycles. On the first day, 5 people came with their bicycles, 3 came with their tricycles, and finally, someone came with a bicycle. How much did they earn?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngithola ukuthi Shawnda wayenza umsebenzi wokufunda izimoto zobuchwepheshe. (I understand that Shawnda started a bicycle repair shop.)

Wayenza ukuthi abantu bakhe bakhokhe 25 cents ngalolo liwumsebenzi. (He charged 25 cents per repair.)

Kwesokunxele, abantu abangama-5 babiza nezimoto zabobuchwepheshe, abantu abangama-3 babiza nezimoto zobhatyi, futhi umuntu omunye wabiza nezimoto yobuchwepheshe. (On the first day, 5 people came with their bicycles, 3 came with their tricycles, and 1 person came with a bicycle.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi wayenza imali engu-25 cents x (5 + 1) = 25 cents x 6 = $1.50. (I think he earned 25 cents x 6 = $1.50.)

152	Carl bought ten packets of cookies. Each package contained six cookies. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much would Carl get if he bought with an extra $10?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Carl bought 10 packets, each with 6 cookies, so he has 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 x $0.10 = $6.

If he pays with an extra $10, he'll get $10 - $6 = $4 in change.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"	4
153	Dave bought a large frit cake and ate fourteen of them before a sleeping bird came to kill him and gave him the cake. When the bird landed, it split the frit that Dave had eaten in half. Then three turkeys chased the bird away from the food and each of them ate three frit cakes. Then a cat ate the remaining three frit cakes. The remaining five frit cakes were scattered by the chickens and the fire. How many frit cakes were in the cake before Dave bought it?	48	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the story:

Dave ate 14 frit cakes.
The bird split the eaten frit cakes in half, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 frit cakes.
Three turkeys ate 3 frit cakes each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 frit cakes.
A cat ate the remaining 3 frit cakes.
The chickens and fire scattered the remaining 5 frit cakes.

Now, let's add up the frit cakes: 7 + 9 + 3 + 5 = 24

Since Dave ate 14 frit cakes initially, we add those to the total: 24 + 14 = 38

So, there were 38 frit cakes in the cake before Dave bought it.

Let's break it down:

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 days/week × 3 hours/day = 9 hours/week
Tuesdays and Sundays: 2 days/week × 2 hours/day = 4 hours/week
Total hours/week: 9 hours/week + 4 hours/week = 13 hours/week

Let's break it down:

* Bill makes 300 pies a day, and they are 4 cm long. To convert cm to feet, we know 1 foot = 30.48 cm, so 4 cm = approximately 0.1312 feet.
* Since Bill used all 300 pies, the total length would be 300 x 0.1312 feet = 39.36 feet.

157	Blake and Kelly trained to see who could run the fastest in 15 minutes. They planned to do it on a 100-yard court. Blake ran 15 times. Kelly ran once and refused to run with Blake. He started running at 40 yards. He ran 34 times. How many yards did the winner run over the loser?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Blake ran 15 times on a 100-yard court, so he ran a total of:
15 x 100 = 1500 yards

Kelly started at 40 yards and ran 34 times, so he ran a total of:
34 x (100 - 40) = 34 x 60 = 2040 yards

The winner is Kelly, and he ran 2040 - 1500 = 540 yards more than Blake.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Umncintisana ukuthi uKelly waye waphakama ngamayadi ayi-540 kuBlake."" (The winner is Kelly, and he surpassed Blake by 540 yards.)"	540

4 pencils for $1.5 each = 4 x $1.5 = $6
2 pens for $4 each = 2 x $4 = $8

Let's break it down:

Anakin has:
- 10 house stars
- 6 hippopotamuses
- 3 pigeons

Locsin has:
- 10 - 5 = 5 house stars
- 6 - 3 = 3 hippopotamuses
- 3 + 2 = 5 pigeons

In total, they have:
- 10 + 5 = 15 house stars
- 6 + 3 = 9 hippopotamuses
- 3 + 5 = 8 pigeons

So, there are 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 pairs.

162	If the price of a bag is $20 and the first one goes up 20% every two months, how much will the price of a bag be after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

After 2 months, the price increases by 20%, so the new price is $20 x 1.2 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $24 x 1.2 = $28.8.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $28.8 x 1.2 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $34.56 x 1.2 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $41.472 x 1.2 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $49.7664 x 1.2 = $59.71968.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $59.71968 x 1.2 = $71.663616.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $71.663616 x 1.2 = $86.036384.

After 30 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $86.036384 x 1.2 = $103.243661.

After 36 months, the price increases by 20% again, so the new price is $103.243661 x 1.2 = $123.892393.

So, after 36 months, the price of a bag will be approximately $123.89.

163	In a room there are many toys: 5 red cars, 3 paintings, and a poupé. 3 paintings cost the poupé, and a red car costs $4. If a painting costs $5, how much are all the toys worth?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 3 paintings cost the same as 1 poupé, so 1 painting costs 1/3 of a poupé.
* A red car costs $4.
* A painting costs $5, so 1 poupé costs 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total value:

* 5 red cars: 5 x $4 = $20
* 3 paintings: 3 x $5 = $15
* 1 poupé: $15

Adding them up: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

So, all the toys are worth $50!

(Translation: Hello! If Jackie does her hair herself, she will spend $35 per hour, and if she takes 3 hours, she will spend $35 x 3 = $105. If she hires a hairdresser, she will spend $90. So, she will spend $105 + $90 = $195.)"	195
165	Elvira bought a new keyboard and accessories as a gift for her 30th birthday. She borrowed 1500€ from her family and they thought she would stay poor and wear a dress. She went to a hardware store and bought a keyboard for 1090€ along with her mouse, keyboard and mouse. She bought a scanner for 157€, a portable CD for 74€ and a breaker. How much will she have left for her clothes?	77	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate how much Elvira will have left for her clothes.

She borrowed 1500€ from her family.

She spent:

* 1090€ on the keyboard and mouse
* 157€ on the scanner
* 74€ on the portable CD
* (no price given for the breaker, so we'll assume it's included in the total)

Total spent = 1090 + 157 + 74 = 1321€

She has 1500€ - 1321€ = 179€ left.

In Zulu, we say ""Izindleko zakhe ziyahlaba ngama-179€"" which means ""She has 179€ left for her clothes"".

Let's break it down:

* Dead man's suit costs $25
* Jacket is 3 times as wet, so 3 x $25 = $75
* Shirt is the same price as the dead man's, so $25
* Total cost of the dirty suit = $25 + $75 + $25 = $125

172	Four birds are eating coffee. Sally Two is three times older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice older than Sally Four. If Sally Four is one year older than Sally Thirtytwo and Sally thirtytwo is eight years older than Sally Thirtytwo, how old are the four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is eight years older than Sally Thirtytwo, which means they are the same age. Let's call this age ""x"".
2. Sally Four is one year older than Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four's age is x + 1.
3. Granny Red is twice older than Sally Four, so Granny Red's age is 2(x + 1) = 2x + 2.
4. Sally Two is three times older than Granny Red, so Sally Two's age is 3(2x + 2) = 6x + 6.

Now, let's find the values:

x = Sally Thirtytwo's age = 8 (since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than herself)
Sally Four's age = x + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
Granny Red's age = 2x + 2 = 2(8) + 2 = 18
Sally Two's age = 6x + 6 = 6(8) + 6 = 54

So, the ages of the four birds are:

* Sally Thirtytwo: 8
* Sally Four: 9
* Granny Red: 18
* Sally Two: 54

173	Jessica is wondering how much she can afford to pay each month for all of her bills. Her college tuition is $300 a month, her tuition is $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than what they'll give her, how much will they pay in a year?	18000	"Sawubona, Jessica! (Hello, Jessica!)

Let's calculate Jessica's total monthly bills:

College tuition: $300
Tuition: $200
Mortgage: $500
Total monthly bills: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more, that's an additional 50% of $1000:
$1000 x 0.5 = $500
So, Jessica wants to pay $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

In a year, Jessica will pay:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

Let's calculate the profit in Zulu: ""Kutheni ukuphumelela?""

They spent $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.

They sold 20 glasses at $0.5 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $0.5 = $10.

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so $10 - $5 = $5.

(Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses and gifts:

* 1/4 of $6000 = $1500 for rent
* 1/3 of $6000 = $2000 for fuel and charity
* $200 for daughter's expenses
* $700 for wife's restaurant

Total expenses and gifts = $1500 + $2000 + $200 + $700 = $4400

Let's break it down: Jenna hits twice under her mother, which means her mother is also hitting. If Jenna hits 20 times, and she hits twice under her mother, that means her mother hits 10 times (since 20 ÷ 2 = 10). So, there are two of them: Jenna and her mother.

186	Russell works on a ranch and distributes grass to the cattle. The cows are divided into 3 herds in groups and each herd has 6 herds. The hamster has 10 herds. The other has a herd and they have 5 herds. There is also a remaining frog and they are divided into 20 herds. The herds are not used anywhere else except in the warehouse. If 160 herds are distributed to the cattle, how many herds are there?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count the herds:

* 3 herds with 6 herds each = 3 x 6 = 18 herds
* The hamster has 10 herds
* The other has 1 herd with 5 herds = 1 x 5 = 5 herds
* The remaining frog has 20 herds

Adding all together: 18 + 10 + 5 + 20 = 53 herds

If 160 herds are distributed to the cattle, then the total number of herds is 160 + 53 = 213 herds.

187	Mandy borrowed $100 from Benedict at an interest rate of 2% per month. If Mandy can sell the gun in 3 months, how much will Benedict get?	106	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I'm happy to help with the conversation!)

Now, let's calculate the interest: $100 x 2% = $2 per month. For 3 months, the interest will be $2 x 3 = $6. So, Benedict will get $100 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $106."	106
188	If a merchant bought sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack, and the sacks were put into storage for $2 and sold for $30 a sack, with a profit of $400, how many sacks would they sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Iphakamiso: (Cost) = $20 (buying from farmer) + $2 (storage) = $22
Impahla: (Selling price) = $30
Inkonzo: (Profit) = $30 - $22 = $8 per sack
Iqiniso: (Total profit) = $400

Now, let's find the number of sacks:

Number of sacks = Total profit / Profit per sack
= $400 / $8
= 50 sacks

So, the merchant would sell 50 sacks of wheat. Ngibonga! (You're welcome!)"	50

192	Tom planted 10 trees in a year. He planted 2 trees in a year. He started with 50 trees. In 10 years, 30% of the trees were dead. How many trees were left?	91	"Ndi Igbo m! (That's ""Let's do it in Igbo!"" for those who don't speak Igbo)

Let's break it down:

Tom started with 50 trees.
In 1 year, he planted 10 + 2 = 12 trees.
In 10 years, he planted 12 x 10 = 120 trees.
So, he had 50 + 120 = 170 trees.
30% of 170 is 0.3 x 170 = 51 trees that died.
So, he had 170 - 51 = 119 trees left.

197	The population of the city of Soda is 23,786 persons: 8,417 men and 9,092 women. The rest are children. How many children do you have in Soda?	6277	"Ehe! Ndi Igbo, o di mma! (Ah! That's good, it's nice!)

Let's calculate the number of children in Soda:

Total population = 23,786
Number of men = 8,417
Number of women = 9,092
Total number of adults = 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509

To find the number of children, subtract the total number of adults from the total population:

Number of children = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277

O di egwu! (It's correct!) There are 6,277 children in Soda."	6277
198	Elaine started out with 20 Pokemon collections. She collected three more in one month. In the second month she didn't collect as many as in the first month. But in the third month, she collected twice as many as in the first two months. How many Pokemon collections does she have now?	320	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: Elaine had 20 Pokémon collections and collected 3 more, so she had 20 + 3 = 23.

Month 2: She didn't collect as many as in the first month, but we don't know the exact number. Let's assume she collected x Pokémon.

Month 3: She collected twice as many as in the first two months, which is 2 × (3 + x) = 6 + 2x.

Now, let's add up all the Pokémon collections: 23 + x + 6 + 2x = 29 + 3x.

Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can't give an exact answer. However, we can say Elaine has 29 + 3x Pokémon collections now.

In Zulu, we can say: ""Elaine unaamakholwa angu-29 + 3x."" (Elaine has 29 + 3x Pokémon collections.)"	3
199	Marc was a researcher. He created one-word puzzles for two different newsrooms each week that paid him differently. Newsroom B paid Marc twice as much as newsroom A. Marc wrote 1,000 words a week while newsroom A paid him 5 cents per word. How much does Marc make in a week?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Newsroom A pays 5 cents per word, and Marc writes 1,000 words a week. So, he earns:

1,000 words/week × 5 cents/word = $50/week from Newsroom A

Newsroom B pays twice as much as Newsroom A, so Marc earns:

$50/week × 2 = $100/week from Newsroom B

In total, Marc makes:

$50/week + $100/week = $150/week

201	John received a special bonus at work. The bonus was $5,000 with a five-fold increase on his salary. If his salary was $2,000 a week, and he was paid every week of the year, how much would he have if he received the bonus on the first day of the year?	114,200	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (That's ""Okay, let's do it!"" in Twi, a Ghanaian language.)

Let's break it down:

John's weekly salary is $2,000. A five-fold increase means his new weekly salary is $2,000 x 5 = $10,000.

Since he receives the bonus on the first day of the year, he'll get 52 weeks of salary (assuming no weeks off). His total salary for the year is $10,000 x 52 = $520,000.

Adding the $5,000 bonus, John's total amount is $520,000 + $5,000 = $525,000.

He eats egg rolls and scrambled eggs at lunch on the third day of the week with a layer of egg rolls. He eats a lot of macaroni with a lot of egg rolls this week and uses 8 layers of egg rolls in a meal. How many layers of egg rolls did he use?	31	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down:

* He eats 1 egg roll with 2 layers every weekday, so that's 2 layers x 5 days = 10 layers
* On the third day, he eats egg rolls and scrambled eggs with 1 layer, so that's 1 layer
* He eats macaroni with a lot of egg rolls using 8 layers

Adding all up, he used 10 + 1 + 8 = 19 layers of egg rolls!

How many laps did Mikael do in all the cycling sessions?	860	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

First, Mikael cycled 5 times a week, doing 25 laps each, for 4 weeks. That's:

Her parents gave her $4 for cutting grass.
So, she has $10 + $20 + $4 = $34.

The suit and shoes cost $30 + $20 = $50.
She needs $50 - $34 = $16 more.

If she earns $4 for cutting grass, she needs to cut grass $16 ÷ $4 = 4 times.

211	Jerry raises chickens. Red hens lay 3 eggs a day and broilers lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry lays 42 eggs a day. If there are more broilers than broilers, how many broilers does Jerry have?	4	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. 

Let x be the number of Red hens and y be the number of broilers. 

We know that Red hens lay 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from Red hens is 3x. 

Broilers lay 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from broilers is 5y. 

The total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up the equation: 

3x + 5y = 42 

We are told that there are more broilers than Red hens, so y > x. 

Let's try x = 4. Then, 3x = 12. 

To find y, we can subtract 12 from 42 and divide by 5: 

(42 - 12) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6 

So, y = 6. 

Jerry has 6 broilers!

213	At the same store, Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. The next day, he counted 50 more than the previous day. If the total number of customers from the first to the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?	250	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, he counted 50 more than the previous day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers from the first to the third day is 500. Let's calculate the total for the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total for the first two days from the total for all three days: 500 - 250 = 250.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

214	Jerry has two swimming pools that discharge four gallons of water a minute. About four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now it has four times as much. How much water was in the smaller pool?	8	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi ukuphakama kwamanzi kwesigaba esincane kwakungakanani? (I want to find out how much water was in the smaller pool?)

Let's break it down:

* The larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago.
* The larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.
* The pools discharge 4 gallons of water per minute.

Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago. Then, the larger pool had 2x water 4 minutes ago.

Now, the smaller pool has x - 4(4) = x - 16 gallons of water (since it discharged 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes).

The larger pool has 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16 gallons of water.

Since the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides gives:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 24

So, the smaller pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Ngithanda ukuthola ukuthi! (I'm happy to have found out!)

216	Janeth borrowed $2,000 and agreed to pay 10 percent interest on the loan. If she borrowed $165 a month for 12 months, how much would she have to pay between now and then?	220	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inketho. (Let me help you get the answer.)

UJaneth uyabonga imali engu-$2,000, futhi uyavuma ukuthola isithuba sesigaba sesi-10%. (Janeth borrowed $2,000 and agreed to pay 10% interest.)

Ukuthola isithuba, sizokwenza ukucophelela: (To calculate the interest, let's do the calculation:)

Isigaba sesi-10% = $2,000 x 0.10 = $200

Ukuthola imali eyenziwayo, sizokwenza ukucophelela: (To calculate the total amount, let's do the calculation:)

Imali eyenziwayo = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Ukuthola imali eyabonga ngomzuzu, sizokwenza ukucophelela: (To calculate the monthly payment, let's do the calculation:)

Imali eyabonga ngomzuzu = $2,200 ÷ 12 = $183.33

Ukuthola imali eyabonga ngomzuzu, uJaneth uyabonga imali engu-$165 ngomzuzu. (So, Janeth pays $165 per month.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi uJaneth uyabonga imali engu-$183.33 ngomzuzu, kodwa uyabonga imali engu-$165 ngomzuzu. (I think Janeth should pay $183.33 per month, but she pays $165 per month.)

219	Four students scored 251 points in a game. Naomi scored 68. Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi's average, and Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi's.	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi's average. To find Naomi's average, we divide her score by 1 (since she's the only one): 68 ÷ 1 = 68. So, Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.

Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi's. That's 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 68 (Naomi) + 78 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 231 points.

We still need to find the fourth student's score. The total score is 251, so the fourth student scored 251 - 231 = 20 points.

Let's break it down:

Celine used 90 liters, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the container.

She ended up with twice as much rainfall as the container holds, which means she got 2 x 120 = 240 liters of rainfall.

Adding the rainfall to the remaining water in the container, we get 30 + 240 = 270 liters.

So, there are 270 liters of water in the container now.

227	At his lunch, Chad asked for a Burrito for his birthday. The Burrito cost $6.50. He asked for $2.00 worth of meat, $1.00 worth of cheese, $1.00 worth of pie, and $2.25 worth of broken noodles. He made the first choice of spending $3.00 more, which would give him a chance to win some extra cash and booze. He had a $5.00 gift card that he had used at the store. How much money was left to pay?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost:

Burrito = $6.50
Meat = $2.00
Cheese = $1.00
Pie = $1.00
Broken noodles = $2.25
Total cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $2.25 = $12.75

He spent an extra $3.00, so the new total is:
$12.75 + $3.00 = $15.75

He had a $5.00 gift card, so he's left to pay:
$15.75 - $5.00 = $10.75

Kalinda moves 4 tiles per minute, and her mother moves half as many, which is 2 tiles per minute. Together, they move 4 + 2 = 6 tiles per minute.

To find out how long it would take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of tiles (360) by the number of tiles they move per minute (6):

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

So, it would take them 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, 30% of the eggs were ready to be eaten, and Ashlyn rejected them. This means 70% of the eggs were left.

Two weeks later, Ashlyn gathered 3/4 of the remaining eggs, which means she gathered 3/4 of 70% = 52.5% of the total eggs.

So, the remaining eggs that hadn't been eaten after those two weeks are:

100% - 30% - 52.5% = 17.5%

Let's break it down:

Jessa is 20 years old.
Jessa is 5 years older than Mary, so Mary is 20 - 5 = 15 years old.
Jeanne is 2 years older than Mary, so Jeanne is 15 + 2 = 17 years old.

Adding their ages together: 20 + 15 + 17 = 52.

* 30% of 1,000 students left through door A = 0.3 x 1,000 = 300 students
* 3/5 of 1,000 students left through door B = (3/5) x 1,000 = 600 students
* Total students who left through doors A and B = 300 + 600 = 900 students
* Since there are 1,000 students in total, the number of students who left through door D = 1,000 - 900 = 100 students

So, 100 students left through door D.

If he could write one page every 6 minutes, how many hours would it take him to write one page a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Mike corresponds with 5 people, then stops with 2, so he's left with 3 people. Each of them sends 2 letters of 5 pages each week, so he receives 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages per week. He responds with the same number of pages, so he writes 30 pages per week.

Since he can write 1 page every 6 minutes, to find the total time it takes him to write 30 pages, we multiply 30 pages by 6 minutes per page: 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

So, it would take Mike 3 hours to write 30 pages per week.

244	Griffin had 24 chickens and gave 5 to Kyle. He gave Billy Kyle twice as many. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her chickens, then Colby took Kyle's quantity. If Griffin finally had 27 food items, how many did Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkulumo yakho! (I'm happy to help you with your question!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Griffin had 24 chickens and gave 5 to Kyle, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 chickens left.

Griffin gave Billy Kyle twice as many, which means Griffin gave Billy 2 x 5 = 10 chickens. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 chickens left.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her chickens, let's call it x. Then, Colby took Kyle's quantity, which is 5 chickens. So, Griffin had 9 + x chickens.

But we know Griffin finally had 27 food items, which includes the chickens. Since Griffin had 9 + x chickens, the remaining food items must be 27 - (9 + x) = 18 food items that are not chickens.

Now, let's solve for x: 9 + x = 27 - 18 => x = 27 - 18 - 9 => x = 0.

Wait, what? Ginger gave Griffin 0 chickens? That can't be right!

Let me recheck my calculations... Ah, I see the mistake! I apologize for the error.

Let's try again. Griffin had 24 chickens and gave 5 to Kyle, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 chickens left.

Griffin gave Billy Kyle twice as many, which means Griffin gave Billy 2 x 5 = 10 chickens. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 chickens left.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her chickens, let's call it x. Then, Colby took Kyle's quantity, which is 5 chickens. So, Griffin had 9 + x chickens.

But we know Griffin finally had 27 food items, which includes the chickens. Since Griffin had 9 + x chickens, the remaining food items must be 27 - (9 + x) = 18 food items that are not chickens.

Now, let's solve for x: 9 + x = 27 => x = 27 - 9 => x = 18.

Ah, yes! Ginger gave Griffin 18 chickens!

245	The difference between the number of rods in the two baskets is equal to twice the number of fish in the two baskets. If both baskets contain the same number of fish, how many fish are in each basket?	7	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kubonga ukuthi kunezinhlobo ezimbili zesitshalo esikhundleni, kufanele kube khona izinhlobo eziyisithupha."" (Let's assume there are 6 fish in each basket.)

Here's the explanation:

Let's say the number of rods in basket A is R, and the number of rods in basket B is R + x, where x is the difference.

The problem states that the difference between the number of rods is equal to twice the number of fish. Since there are the same number of fish in each basket, let's call this number F.

We can set up the equation: x = 2F

Since the number of rods in basket B is R + x, we can substitute x with 2F:

R + 2F = R + x

Subtract R from both sides:

2F = x

Now, we know that x is the difference between the number of rods, so it must be a whole number. The smallest possible value of x is 2, which means F = 1.

However, the problem asks for the number of fish in each basket, so we need to find the smallest possible value of F that satisfies the equation. Let's try F = 2:

x = 2F
x = 2(2)
x = 4

This works! If there are 2 fish in each basket, the difference between the number of rods would be 4, which is a whole number.

So, in each basket, there are 2 fish: ""Kunezinhlobo eziyisithupha!"" (There are 6 fish!)"	6
246	Jeanne's stylist was to pay her $250 for an hour. She needed to prepare well for a film in which she would spend 6 hours a day. She had to do it 4 times a week. The film took 5 weeks. After the film was completed, Jane would receive a 10% discount for her work. How much did Jane pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the problem:

* Jeanne's stylist gets $250 per hour.
* She works 6 hours a day, so that's 6 x $250 = $1500 per day.
* She works 4 days a week, so that's $1500 x 4 = $6000 per week.
* The film takes 5 weeks, so that's $6000 x 5 = $30,000.
* After the 10% discount, Jeanne pays $30,000 - (10% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

So, Jeanne pays $27,000.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Kulungile! (That's correct!)"	9200
