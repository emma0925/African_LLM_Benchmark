0	Janet's aunt makes 16 eggs a day. She makes three for breakfast every morning, and then she makes four for her friends every day. She sells the leftovers at the farmer's market every day for $2 per egg. How much money does she make a day at the farmer's market?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Janet's aunt makes 16 eggs a day.
She uses 3 for breakfast, leaving 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
She gives 4 to her friends, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, making 9 x $2 = $18 per day.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) She makes $18 per day at the farmer's market.

2	Josh decided to try the real estate business. He bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 to renovate the house. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial investment = $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (renovation cost) = $130,000

The renovation increased the value by 150%, so the new value = $130,000 x 2.5 (1 + 1.5) = $325,000

Profit = New value - Initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

4	Every day Wendi feeds three cups of raw chicken feed, containing seeds, protein and vegetables for good health. She feeds the chickens three times. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens 25 cups. How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?	20	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kwakutheni ukudla kwabantu bakhe ngomhlaka?"" (How much food does she give her chickens in a day?)

Let's calculate:

Wendi feeds 3 cups per chicken, 3 times a day. So, for 20 chickens, it's 20 x 3 = 60 cups per feeding time. Since she feeds 3 times, it's 60 x 3 = 180 cups.

Adding the morning and afternoon feedings, it's 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

In total, Wendi feeds her chickens 180 + 40 = 220 cups of food per day.

5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each subsequent glass is only 60% off its price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for the glasses?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi uma Kylar efuna ukuthenga iziglas 16, inani lezimali azofuna ukulipha?

(Let me calculate how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses.)

Iziglas lesi-1 = $5
Iziglas lesi-2 = $5 * 0.4 = $2
Iziglas lesi-3 = $2 * 0.4 = $0.8
Iziglas lesi-4 = $0.8 * 0.4 = $0.32
...
Iziglas lesi-16 =...

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi inani lezimali azofuna ukulipha = $5 + $2 + $0.8 +... + $0.32 * (0.4^13) = $43.37

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

In total, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

7	Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB per minute, but after 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to update some applications, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from scratch. How many gigabytes will it take to download this file?	160	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Carla can download 2 GB per minute. To download 200 GB, it would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

But, after 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart. 40% of 200 GB is:

200 GB × 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla downloads 80 GB in:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

Then, the restart takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla has to restart the download from scratch. To download the entire 200 GB file, it will take:

100 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 160 minutes

In total, Carla will download:

160 minutes × 2 GB/min = 320 GB

8	John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns around to realize that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but then spends the first 2 hours in a ditch. He spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before he gets a chance to drive the rest of the time with 4 hours left, traveling at 80mph. How far is he from home at the end of these 4 hours?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down John's journey:

1. He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. He turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in a ditch, so he doesn't move.

3. He drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. He has 4 hours left and drives at 80 mph. To find the distance, we'll calculate:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 4 hours = 320 miles

Now, let's find out how far John is from home:
Initial distance from home = 180 miles
Distance covered after turning around = 15 miles + 320 miles = 335 miles

Since John is moving towards home, we'll subtract the distance covered from the initial distance:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 335 miles = -155 miles

Since distance can't be negative, we'll take the absolute value:
Distance from home = 155 miles

John is 155 miles away from home at the end of these 4 hours.

10	A new program received 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month, but then it dropped by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did this program get in total in three months?	366	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 times Month 1 = 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Month 3: 180 - 30% of 180 = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Total downloads in 3 months = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

11	Toula went to the bakery and bought a variety of cakes. She bought 3 dozen doughnuts that cost $68 each, 2 dozen cakes that cost $80 each, and 6 dozen cookies for $55 each. What was the total price?	694	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total price:

3 dozen doughnuts = 3 x 12 = 36 doughnuts
Cost of doughnuts = 36 x $68 = $2448

2 dozen cakes = 2 x 12 = 24 cakes
Cost of cakes = 24 x $80 = $1920

6 dozen cookies = 6 x 12 = 72 cookies
Cost of cookies = 72 x $55 = $3960

Total price = $2448 + $1920 + $3960 = $8328

Ukuthula, ngithole ukuthi iphakathi likaToula liyahluka ngama-$8328! (Peace, I have found that Toula's total is $8328!)"
12	Carlos planted a lemon tree. It would cost $90 for a lemon. Each year he would produce 7 lemons, each of which he could sell for $1.5. Water and fertilizer for the tree cost $3 a year. How long would it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

U Carlos uyaphatha igazi lelemoni. Igazi lelemoni liyaba ngamakhulu ayi-90. Ngonyaka oyedwa, uyaphuma amalemoni ayi-7, ayinikeza ngamakhulu ayi-1.5 ngalemoni. Amanzi nama-fertilizer ayengawuthola ngamakhulu ayi-3 ngonyaka.

Ukuthola ukuthi uyaqala ukuthola imali kusasa kwalemoni?

(To find out when he will start making money from the lemon tree?)

Let's calculate:

Revenue per year = 7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Cost per year = $3/year
Net income per year = Revenue per year - Cost per year = $10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year

Since Carlos invested $90 initially, it will take him:

$90 (initial investment) ÷ $7.5 (net income per year) = 12 years

for him to start making money from the lemon tree.

Ukuthola! (There you go!)"
13	Melanie was a door-to-door salesperson. She sold three-quarters of her garbage disposal in the green house, 2 in the red house, half of the remainder in the lemon-water house. If Melanie had 5 garbage disposal machines, how many did she start with?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Melanie sold 3/4 of her garbage disposal machines in the green house. That means she sold 3/4 of x, where x is the total number of machines she had.

She sold 2 in the red house, leaving her with x - 3/4x - 2 machines.

Then, she sold half of the remainder in the lemon-water house. That means she sold (1/2)(x - 3/4x - 2) machines.

We know she had 5 machines left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 3/4x - 2 - (1/2)(x - 3/4x - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 3/4x - 2 - 1/2x + 3/8x + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

5/8x - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

5/8x = 6

Multiply both sides by 8/5:

x = 24/5

x = 4.8

Since you can't have a fraction of a machine, Melanie must have started with 5 machines.

14	In a dance class of 20, 20% of the students were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest were involved in hip-hop dance. What percentage of all students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

20% of 20 students = 4 students (modern dance)
25% of 20 students = 5 students (jazz dance)

Total students in modern and jazz dance = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 20 - 9 = 11 students

Percentage of students in hip-hop dance = (11/20) x 100% = 55%

So, 55% of the students were enrolled in hip-hop dance.

15	A businessman wants to make a purchase choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will rise by 2.5 percent while the electronics market will rise by 1.2 percent this month. If the businessman is looking to increase his profit margin at the end of this month by making a choice, what is this profit margin?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuba umuntu osebenzisa imali yakhe ukuthenga izinto ezimbili, izicathulo ezinhle nezicathulo zokubonga, kufanele athole ukuthi izicathulo ezinhle zizogcina ngaphezu kwesilinganiso sesithupha senani, ezicathulo zokubonga zizogcina ngaphezu kwesilinganiso sesikhombisa.""

In English, that means: ""If the person uses their money to buy two things, jewelry and electronics, they should find that the jewelry will increase by 2.5 percent, and the electronics will increase by 1.2 percent.""

To calculate the profit margin, let's do the math:

For jewelry: $5,000 x 2.5% = $125
New value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For electronics: $8,000 x 1.2% = $96
New value of electronics = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

The profit margin is the difference between the new values: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125 (jewelry) and $8,096 - $8,000 = $96 (electronics).

So, the businessman's profit margin would be $125 (2.5%) if he chooses the jewelry, or $96 (1.2%) if he chooses the electronics. The better choice would be to invest in jewelry, with a higher profit margin."

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what would her annual salary be?	57500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

As a teacher, she works 35 hours/week × 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year.

As a coach, she works 15 hours/week × 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year.

Total hours worked per year = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours/year.

Assuming an hourly wage of, say, R200 ( Rand, the South African currency), her annual salary would be:

2500 hours/year × R200/hour = R500,000 per year.

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. But when I pour out one liter of orange juice, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

You have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water. So, the total water is 10 x 3/2 = 15 liters.

You add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. So, the total water is 15 x 5/3 = 25 liters.

Now, you pour out 1 liter of orange juice, leaving 24 liters in total.

To find the amount of water left, subtract the total juice (orange + pineapple) from the total liquid: 24 - (10 - 1 + 15) = 24 - 24 = 0 liters.

So, there's no water left in the remaining 24 liters. It's all juice!

21	Raymond and Samantha are blood brothers. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son aged 23. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how long ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Samantha is 31 years old now, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. So, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.

Raymond's son is 23 years old now, and Raymond is 37 years old now. To find out how long ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract 23 from 37: 37 - 23 = 14.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

24	Kyle bought last year's edition for $19.50. This included a 25% discount from its original price. What was the actual price of the book?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the original price of the book.

Discount = 25% of original price
Discount = 0.25 × original price

The discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

Original price - Discount = $19.50

Substitute the discount formula:

Original price - 0.25 × original price = $19.50

Simplify the equation:

0.75 × original price = $19.50

Divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $19.50 ÷ 0.75
Original price = $26.00

So, the actual price of the book was $26.00.

* 4 toasters = 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total cost so far = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
* Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

29	Gloria went shoe shopping when she came across a pair of sauciki shoes that fit her shoe budget. However, she had to choose between a sauciki and two polished shoes that together cost five dollars less than the cost of a sauciki. If one polished shoe cost $33 and one polished shoe cost twice as much, how much was the sauciki?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

One polished shoe costs $33. The other polished shoe costs twice as much, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Together, the two polished shoes cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The sauciki shoes cost $5 more than the two polished shoes together, so that's $99 + $5 = $104.

So, the sauciki shoes cost $104.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Izicathamo zikaSauciki zibe ngu-$104."" (The Sauciki shoes cost $104.)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says 80.
2. The second friend says 20 more than the first half, which is 80 / 2 = 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first half, which is 80 / 2 = 40 + 25% of 40 = 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the average:

(80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33

So, their average guess is 63.33.

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem in isiZulu, a beautiful African language spoken in South Africa.

Gretchen una-mali angu-110. (Gretchen has 110 coins.)

Kune-30 amagold akabiya amasiliva. (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.)

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. The number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

Gretchen una-70 amagold. (Gretchen has 70 gold coins.)"

Let's break it down step by step:

Raymond has 40 jewels.
Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 ÷ 2 = 20.
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
Siobhan has 2 more jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 + 2 = 27 jewels.

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!) Siobhan has 27 jewels."
35	Mike plays ping pong gem for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many points did he score in total?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points, which means he scores:

4 points x 1.25 (25% increase) = 5 points

Total points scored = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

So, Mike scores a total of 9 points.

36	Terry drinks 2 yogurts a day. Currently 4 yogurts are sold for $5. How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifundisa ukuthi Terry uyadla amayogurt ayi-2 ngosuku. Kuyaphela kwaba 4 amayogurt ayi-$5. Kutheni uyaphenduka kangakanani emalini ayi-30?

(Translation: I understand that Terry drinks 2 yogurts a day. Currently, 4 yogurts cost $5. So how much does he spend in 30 days?)

Ukubonga! (Answer!)

Terry uyadla amayogurt ayi-2 ngosuku. Emalini ayi-30, uyadla amayogurt ayi-2 x 30 = amayogurt ayi-60.

(Translation: Terry drinks 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he drinks 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.)

Amayogurt ayi-60 ayaba ngama-4 amayogurt ayi-$5. Kutheni amayogurt ayi-60 ayaba ngama-60/4 = 15 x $5 = $75.

(Translation: 60 yogurts cost the same as 15 sets of 4 yogurts at $5 each. So 60 yogurts cost 15 x $5 = $75.)

Kutheni Terry uyaphenduka kangakanani emalini ayi-30? Uyaphenduka $75!"
37	John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video gems. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He eventually sells 8 video gems for $20 each and has $5 left over. How many sets of Lego does he have now?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he gets:
13 x $15 = $195

He buys 8 video gems for $20 each, so he spends:
8 x $20 = $160

He has $5 left over, which means he had $195 - $160 = $35 left after buying video gems.

But the question asks how many Lego sets he has now. The answer is... NONE! He sold all 13 Lego sets!

In isiZulu, we can say: ""UJohn unaLego ayi-13 kuphela!"" (John has no Lego sets left at all!)"
38	John runs 60 miles a week, three days a week, three hours on the first day and half that on the other two days.	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

UJohn uyaphenduka izinhlobo zami-60 emvikweni wesizinda, esikhathini esithathu wesizinda, esikhathini esithathu emsombuluko wesokuqala, futhi ukuphinde ukuba ngamaphuzu amabili emsombuluko wesibili nesethathu.

(John runs 60 miles a week, three days a week, three hours on the first day and half that on the other two days.)

Now, let's calculate:

Day 1: 3 hours
Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
Day 3: 3/2 = 1.5 hours

Total hours: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

UJohn uyaphenduka izinhlobo zami-60 emvikweni wesizinda, esikhathini esithathu wesizinda, esikhathini esithathu emsombuluko wesokuqala, futhi ukuphinde ukuba ngamaphuzu amabili emsombuluko wesibili nesethathu. Uyaphenduka izikhathi ezintathu zemvikweni wesizinda."

41	A giant rock, named Peg, sits there on top of Mount Farbo and shoots fire at anything but 1000 feet away. Polly can throw a golden spear, the only known weapon that can kill the monster, 400 feet, well before reaching the location of the monster's fire belt. But when Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the spear three times faster than it would be if she didn't hold the stone. If she holds the stone, how far would she stand and throw the spear to find the monster dead and the fire belt flapping?	200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""U-Polly ungathatha isikhali esibuthakathaka ngaphambi kokuthola ku-Peg, u-Peg uzokuvuka ngemuva kwesikhali.""

Now, let's calculate the distance. Without the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the spear 400 feet. With the stone, she can throw it three times faster, which means 3 × 400 = 1200 feet. Since the fire belt is at 1000 feet, Polly can stand at 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and throw the spear to kill the monster."
42	Goggo Jones baked 5 coffees for the fireman's party. She distributed 8 coffees each and then placed 5 coffees on the buffet table for the guests to eat.

Let's count, Goggo Jones baked 5 coffees for the fireman's party. She distributed 8 coffees each and then placed 5 coffees on the buffet table for the guests to eat. Finally in the evening, after the guests ate the coffees, there were 14 left over. So, how many coffees did the guests eat?

Answer: 
Goggo Jones started with 5 coffees. She distributed 8 each, so that's 8 x? = 40 coffees. Then she added 5 more, making it 40 + 5 = 45 coffees. After the guests ate, there were 14 left, so the guests ate 45 - 14 = 31 coffees."
43	According to its nutrient profile, one bag of chips contains 250 grams of chlorine per serving. If a 300-gram bag is to be used 5 times, how many grams can you eat if you daily need 2000 after you have already consumed 1800 calories?	48	"Kwaku, ɛyɛ yiye! (Hello, my friend!)

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think there might be some mistake. Chlorine is not a nutrient, and it's not safe for human consumption in large quantities. Perhaps you meant to say something else?

Assuming you meant to ask about the calorie content, let's work with that. You've already consumed 1800 calories and need 2000 calories daily. That means you still need:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, if you have a 300-gram bag of chips and you want to use it 5 times, that means each serving would be:

300 grams ÷ 5 = 60 grams per serving

To find out how many grams you can eat to meet your remaining calorie needs, we'd need to know the calorie density of the chips. Unfortunately, that information isn't provided. If you can give me that information, I'd be happy to help you further!

Count the number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday: 5 articles × 4 hours/article = 20 hours

Tuesday: 2/5 × 5 = 2 articles × 4 hours/article = 8 hours

46	Candice puts 80 order notes in her bag before she leaves for her job at the coffee shop. On her way, she stops at the grocery store and buys order notes; at work, she puts this one order note on each of the 220 cups of coffee. If she has 23 remaining order notes left in total, how many order notes are in the packet she buys?	163	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Candice starts with 80 order notes.
She buys some more at the grocery store, let's call that x.
At work, she uses 220 order notes, leaving her with 23.

We can set up the equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23

Solving for x, we get: x = 163

So, the packet she buys contains 163 order notes.

52	Uriah's book bag was heavy. He had to remove 15 pounds of it. His comic books weighed a quarter of a pound each and his toys weighed a half pound each. If he collected 30 comic books, how many children's toys did he need to remove?	15	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's break it down:

Uriah's book bag was heavy, so he had to remove 15 pounds.

He had 30 comic books, each weighing a quarter of a pound. That's 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

So, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs a half pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

53	A mechanic charges different fees for repairing truck tires and trailers. For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic charges $60 and for each small car tire repaired, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 trailers. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailers tires and did not repair any truck tires. How much extra income did the mechanic earn that day to get the extra work done?	40	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, so that's 6 x $60 = $360. And 4 trailers at $40 each, so that's 4 x $40 = $160. Total income on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailers at $40 each, so that's 12 x $40 = $480. No truck tires were repaired, so no extra income from that.

The extra income on Friday is $480 - $520 = -$40. But wait, that's a decrease! The mechanic actually earned $40 less on Friday compared to Thursday.

So, the answer is: the mechanic did not earn any extra income on Friday. In fact, they earned $40 less."
54	The Doubtfire brothers came home with 7 cats they had adopted from the animal shelter just as their mother called to inform them that their two cats had given birth. She said Patchy, the first witch, gave birth to three times as many kittens as they had adopted, while Trixie, the other witch, gave birth to 12. How many cats does the Doubtfire family have now?	40	"Ewe o! (That's ""Okay!"" in Yoruba)

Let's count the cats:

The brothers brought home 7 cats.
Patchy gave birth to 3 times 7 = 21 kittens.
Trixie gave birth to 12 kittens.
So, the total number of new kittens is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.
Adding the original 2 cats, the total number of cats is 33 + 2 + 7 = 42 cats.

What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge?	83	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck.

The bridge can hold 5000 pounds. The truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds, leaving 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds for the boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes is 1245 ÷ 15 = 83 boxes.

Let's calculate:

* 20% of 25 oranges are green = 0.2 x 25 = 5 oranges
* 2 oranges are juicy
* 1 orange is bad
* Total oranges that are not good, green, or juicy = 25 - 5 - 2 - 1 = 17 oranges

62	If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year. Starting at age 20, she is entitled to 5% of the value of her pension each year. If she retires after 30 years, what is her annual pension?	25000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Ukuthola impesheni yomuntu ngonyaka, ungaba ngu-50 000 ngonyaka.""

Now, let's calculate Marcy's annual pension:

Marcy works for 30 years, and she's entitled to 5% of the value of her pension each year. So, she gets:

30 years x 5% = 1.5 (or 150% of the annual pension)

Since the full pension is $50,000 per year, Marcy's annual pension would be:

$50,000 x 1.5 = $75,000 per year

Ukuthola impesheni yakhe ngonyaka, ungaba ngu-75 000 ngonyaka! (Her annual pension is $75,000 per year!)"

If the company charged her the first payment for the first half of the year and then charged 10% for the other half of the year, calculate the amount she paid for the online service at the end of the year.	1596	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

For the first half of the year, Alena paid $140/month for 6 months = $140 x 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the company charged 10% less, so the new monthly rate is $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126/month

For the second half of the year, Alena paid $126/month for 6 months = $126 x 6 = $756

Total amount paid at the end of the year = $840 + $756 = $1596

Let's break it down:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV, and then reads for half of that time, which is 2/2 = 1 hour. So, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, making it a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day.

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week, he spends 3 hours/day × 3 days = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

66	There are four schools competing in the basketball tournament. Each school sends a women's basketball team and a men's basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school sends a coach to each team. So, how many people did all the schools send?	48	"Ehe, ngwanu! (Ah, okay!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Each school has two teams, women's and men's, with 5 players each. That's 2 teams x 5 players = 10 players per school.

Each school also sends a coach for each team, so that's 2 coaches per school.

Now, let's multiply the number of players and coaches per school by the number of schools: 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply 12 people per school by 4 schools: 12 people/school x 4 schools = 48 people.

So, all the schools sent 48 people in total.

67	A hunter discovers a buried treasure trove filled with precious stones - 175 pearls, 35 of them less than a yak, and twice as many emeralds as a yak.	595	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu, my friend.

* ""Less than a yak"" means 35 pearls are smaller than a yak. A yak is a type of long-haired bovine, but in this context, it's a unit of measurement. Let's assume a yak is equal to 10. So, 35 pearls are smaller than 10.
* ""Twice as many emeralds as a yak"" means there are 2 times 10 emeralds, which is 20 emeralds.

Now, let's count the total number of precious stones:

* 175 pearls
* 20 emeralds

In total, the hunter found 175 + 20 = 195 precious stones!

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question, my friend!"

69	Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then she gets a $5 weekly allowance for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much did Bailey start with?	60	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Bailey gets a $5 weekly allowance for 8 weeks, so she gets a total of:

$5 x 8 = $40

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the allowance from the total:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

75	Luke was spending his time on the beach building with sand. He finally noticed that each level of the sandcastle would have half the square of the level of the level below it. If he made a standard sandcastle 4 where the top level was 16 squares, what was the average level of one square?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Level 1 (bottom): 16² = 256 squares
Level 2: 256 / 2 = 128 squares
Level 3: 128 / 2 = 64 squares
Level 4 (top): 64 / 2 = 16 squares

Total squares: 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 = 464
Total levels: 4

Average level of one square: 464 / 4 = 116

So, the average level of one square is 116.

If one dog food bag contains 110 cups, I will calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year?)

Ukubonga! (Okay!)

Let's calculate the total cups of dog food needed in the first year:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup/day × 180 days = 180 cups

After 180 days, there are 185 days left in the year (365 - 180 = 185). Cecilia needs 2 cups/day × 185 days = 370 cups

Total cups needed in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need:
550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Kusho ukuthi Cecilia izosebenzisa ibhagi eli-5 kuze kube ngumnyaka wesithupha! (So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year!)"

Let's break it down:

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
David does 1/4 of Sarah's laundry, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

78	Vincent can buy flowers in a 3-pack for $2.50 or in a 2-pack for $1. How much discount would he get by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers:

**3-pack for $2.50:**
18 flowers ÷ 3 = 6 packs needed
Cost = 6 packs × $2.50 = $15.00

**2-pack for $1:**
18 flowers ÷ 2 = 9 packs needed
Cost = 9 packs × $1.00 = $9.00

By buying the 2-pack, Vincent gets a discount of:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent gets a discount of $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price.

80	Two girls each received one-sixth of a quart [24 L]; one boy received six quarts [6.5 L]; how many quarts [6.5 L] of water remained?	10	"Nkɔso! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 2 girls each received 1/6 of a quart, which is 24 L / 6 = 4 L each. So, they received a total of 2 x 4 L = 8 L.
* 1 boy received 6 quarts, which is 6 x 6.5 L = 39 L.
* Total water given out is 8 L + 39 L = 47 L.
* Initially, there was 24 L x 4 (since 1 quart is 24 L) = 96 L of water.
* Water remaining is 96 L - 47 L = 49 L.
* To convert this back to quarts, we divide by 6.5 L: 49 L ÷ 6.5 L = 7.54 quarts.

So, 7.54 quarts of water remained.

84	One soccer team played 22 games, winning 8 more than they lost.	15	"Ndi ewu na-eri! (That's great!)

Let's break it down in Igbo:

Ha bụ otu ndị soccer kachasị 22 egwuregwu, merie 8 karịa ha tụfuru.

To find the number of wins and losses, let's use algebra:

Let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses.

We know that the total number of games is 22, so W + L = 22.

We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost, so W = L + 8.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

L + 8 + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide by 2:

L = 7

Now that we have the number of losses, we can find the number of wins:

W = L + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

So, the team won 15 games and lost 7 games.

Each row on the knife is sewn with the areas of the tishat he has from different ages. He takes 4 vacations a year and has been on vacation since he was 23. He is now 34 years old. How many areas does he have in total?	44	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in Zulu, my friend:

Gene takes 4 vacations a year, and he's been doing this since he was 23. He's now 34, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In 11 years, he's taken 11 x 4 = 44 vacations.

Each vacation, he wears a different tishat shirt with a different area. So, he has 44 different areas.

Now, let's count the areas on the knife. Each row on the knife has areas from different ages. Since he's been doing this for 11 years, each row has 11 areas. And since he takes 4 vacations a year, each row has 4 x 11 = 44 areas.

But wait, we already counted those areas! So, the total number of areas Gene has is still 44.

87	One company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for those who have stayed with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after three additional years of service?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sylvie's initial salary is $600/month. Since it's a monthly salary, we need to calculate the annual salary: $600/month × 12 = $7,200/year.

After 5 years, Sylvie gets a 10% increase. To find the increase, multiply the initial salary by 10%: $7,200 × 0.10 = $720.

Add the increase to the initial salary: $7,200 + $720 = $7,920/year.

This is Sylvie's salary after 5 years. For the next 3 years, she'll get another 10% increase each year.

Year 6: $7,920 × 0.10 = $792 increase. New salary: $7,920 + $792 = $8,712/year.

Year 7: $8,712 × 0.10 = $871.20 increase. New salary: $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20/year.

Year 8: $9,583.20 × 0.10 = $958.32 increase. New salary: $9,583.20 + $958.32 = $10,541.52/year.

So, after 3 additional years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $10,541.52.

88	Marilyn's first record sold for 10 cents more than Harald's, so if 88,000 copies were sold, how many copies did Harald sell?	8000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Marilyn's first record sold for 10 cents more than Harald's, so let's say Harald's record sold for x cents. Then Marilyn's record sold for x + 10 cents.

Since 88,000 copies were sold in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) = 88,000

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 88,000

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 87,990

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 43,995

So Harald sold 43,995 copies.

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't attend. To find the number of attendees, subtract 1/4 from 1 (whole):

Let's break it down:

Lee runs 400m in 38 seconds.
Gerald runs 400m 2 seconds slower, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
Gerald's speed improves by 10%, so his new time is 40 - (40 x 10%) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald can manage the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

If there are 30 cars on the highway at first, how many cars get stuck in traffic in the first 15 minutes?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, there are 30 cars on the highway.
5 cars leave to avoid getting stuck in traffic, so we're left with 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
In the first 15 minutes, some cars leave, and in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars pass. This means the number of cars that left in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars minus the 20 that passed in the remaining 15 minutes.
So, the number of cars that got stuck in traffic in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5 cars.

She heard the teacher and decided that tomorrow she would give her friends 1 potted plant from each hill. How many potted plants would Mary have?	58	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's count the number of potted plants Mary has:

* She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 windows, so that's 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants.
* Yesterday, she received 18 new plants, making a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Now, let's assume each hill has an equal number of potted plants. Since she wants to give 1 potted plant from each hill to her friends, we don't know the number of hills, but we know she'll give away an unknown number of potted plants.

To find the number of potted plants Mary will have, we can't give an exact answer, but we can say she'll have 98 - x potted plants, where x is the number of potted plants she gives away.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""UMary uzoba nesiqaphelo sesiqaphelo 98 - x."" (Mary will have 98 - x potted plants.)"
100	Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him one day. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring?	175	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed 1/4 more than the first friend, so 20 + (20/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed 10 more times than the fourth friend, so 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell rang:
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

Kusho ukuthi ibhelli lingenwa 175! (That means the doorbell rang 175 times!)"
101	Solo read 4 pages from his Science book, 20 pages from his Social Studies book, 7 pages from his Biography book and 8 pages from his Geography book. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he had 4 more days to complete all his studies, how many pages would he need to read, on average, in one day?	6	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (Biography) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

He has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has:

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages left to read

He has 4 days to complete his studies, so he needs to read:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Solo needs to read 6 pages per day, on average, to complete his studies."
102	John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch and dinner. Finally, he has one before going to bed as well. John does this all weekdays, but on weekends he likes to relax and drink soda with dinner instead. How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?	26	"Ewe: Mía John xɔ nueto etɛ̃ kple gbadza kple afɔ, eye wò nyɔ nueto gbɔ. Ewò wò dɔ nueto etɛ̃ ɖu kple azɛ, eye wò gbɔ nueto gbɔ.

104	Poppy solves a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She puts a quarter of the puzzles on the screen, and the aunt puts a third of the rest. How many jigsaws are left to put?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy puts a quarter of 1000 pieces, which is 1000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces.

The rest is 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

The aunt puts a third of the rest, which is 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces put is 250 + 250 = 500 pieces.

The number of jigsaws left to put is 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces.

In isiZulu, ""Izinhlelo ezinhlanu nezinhlanu"" (500 pieces are left)."
105	Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies are left?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, so Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.

If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats 15 cookies, together they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

To answer your question, we need to know how many cookies there were in total. Let's assume there were 25 cookies. If they ate 20 cookies, then 25 - 20 = 5 cookies are left.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
106	John has 3 boxes, each box being 5 by 6 by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total depth of all 3 boxes?	72	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Each box is 4 inches deep, and the walls are 1 inch thick, so the total depth of each box is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total depth of all 3 boxes is 3 x 6 = 18 inches.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
107	Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches a 1-hour episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watches a 30-minute episode of a drama. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute drama. On Friday, he is usually up on weekends, so he watches two 1-hour episodes. If he watches TV for 7 hours in total, how many minutes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights x 1 hour/night = 2 hours
Wednesday: x hours (we'll come back to this)
Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Total hours: 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Solving for x, we get:
x = 1.5 hours

Converting to minutes:
1.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

So, on Wednesday, Frankie watched TV for 90 minutes.

108	Henry was baking biscuits for a home-baked meal competition. He wanted to double what he had baked last year. After he finished baking, he realized that he had actually baked 15 more biscuits than he wanted to. He had thrown out 5 of his biscuit biscuits while taking them out for cooling, and now he had 110 biscuits. How many biscuits had Henry baked last year?	50	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola inkululeko! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's work it out:

Henry had 110 biscuits after throwing out 5, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 biscuits initially.

He baked 15 more than he wanted to, so he wanted to bake 115 - 15 = 100 biscuits.

Since he wanted to double what he baked last year, he baked last year's number x 2 = 100.

To find last year's number, we divide 100 by 2: 100 ÷ 2 = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 biscuits last year.

Ngiyabonga ukuthola inkululeko! (I'm grateful for the opportunity to help!)"
109	A neighborhood gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. The company's app gives $0.20 free for every gallon purchased there. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, what is the price of the gas after the gift?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi (Let me calculate)... 

Igazi elinganiselwa (The original price) = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Igifolo (The discount) = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Igazi elingakho (The final price) = Igazi elinganiselwa - Igifolo = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Kusho ukuthi (So, the answer is) $28.00!"
110	Marcell and Beatrice compete to see who can eat the most rol-op, so they open as many as they can get. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake, Beatrice's rol-op is two inches wide and 24 inches long while Marcell's is 3 inches wide and 14 inches tall. If they ate all together, what was the average amount they ate?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the area of each rol-op:

Beatrice's rol-op: 2 inches wide x 24 inches long = 48 square inches
Marcell's rol-op: 3 inches wide x 14 inches tall = 42 square inches

Total area: 48 + 42 = 90 square inches

To find the average, divide the total area by 2:
90 ÷ 2 = 45 square inches

So, the average amount they ate is 45 square inches.

111	Julia's shells began to leak when she was on the lake. The shell takes two liters of water for every ten feet it sails back to shore. It takes sixteen seconds to sail twenty feet. Another 64 seconds to reach shore. How much water did the ship carry when Julia reached the shore?	16	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* The shell takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it sails back to shore.
* It takes 16 seconds to sail 20 feet, so the rate is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.
* To reach the shore, it takes another 64 seconds, so the total distance sailed is 1.25 feet/second x 80 seconds (16 + 64) = 100 feet.
* Since the shell takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, it will take 2 liters x 10 = 20 liters for 100 feet.

So, Julia's ship carried 20 liters of water when she reached the shore!

(Translation: I want to calculate that Ryan plants two flowers a day, and he planted for 15 days. If five flowers did not grow, how many flowers are left?)

Ukucophelela: 2 (amaqhinga ngosuku) x 15 (izinsuku) = 30 (amaqhinga)
Uma amaqhinga amahlanu angagcina ukukhula, inani laba maqhinga asebenzayo = 30 - 5 = 25

(Translation: Calculation: 2 (flowers per day) x 15 (days) = 30 (flowers)
If five flowers did not grow, how many flowers are left? = 30 - 5 = 25)

Ryan uyaphatha amaqhinga ayi-25! (Ryan has 25 flowers!)"
114	Jamal's phone can take six times as many pictures as Brittany's. The maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can take is 50 times the number of birds on Jamal's photo of a peacock he took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can take 1800 pictures, how many peacocks can be seen in Jamal's photo of a peacock at the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Jamal's phone can take 6 times as many pictures as Brittany's, so if Jamal's phone can take 1800 pictures, Brittany's phone can take:

1800 ÷ 6 = 300 pictures

Brittany's phone can take 50 times the number of birds on Jamal's photo of a peacock, so the number of birds on the photo is:

300 ÷ 50 = 6

So, there are 6 peacocks in Jamal's photo of a peacock at the zoo!

115	Sasha noticed that the price of the wood had increased by 50% in the last few months after she bought the wood. Since she had leftovers, she decided to sell them. She left ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each. She also had five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sold them all, how much profit would she make?	90	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxelo! (I'm happy to help you with that!)

Let's calculate the profit:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price = $10 each
New price = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
Profit per board = $15 - $10 = $5 each
Total profit = $5 x 10 boards = $50

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price = $16 each
New price = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each
Profit per board = $24 - $16 = $8 each
Total profit = $8 x 5 boards = $40

Total profit = $50 + $40 = $90

Sasha would make a profit of $90.

116	Katy prepares coffee by using a large spoonful of sugar and cups of water in the 7:13 ratio. If she used a total of 120 spoons of sugar and cups of water, count how many cups of sugar she used.	42	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 spoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

We know the total number of spoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Let's use ""s"" to represent the number of sets of sugar and water.

7s + 13s = 120

Combine like terms:

20s = 120

Divide by 20:

s = 6

Now, multiply the number of sets by the number of spoons of sugar per set:

Sugar used = 7s = 7(6) = 42 spoons

Katy used 42 spoons of sugar.

119	Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. After four years, his salary has increased, and he is again earning 40% more than he did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salary increased at the same time, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary they both receive after the next years?	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000. Lylah's salary was 30% lower, so:

Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769

Now, Adrien's salary has increased by 40%, so:

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000

Since Lylah's salary increased at the same rate, her new salary is:

Lylah's new salary = $30,769 x 1.4 = $43,076

The total salary they both receive is:

$56,000 + $43,076 = $99,076

Let Morisette bring x dresses and y lemons. Since Kael brought twice as many dresses, Kael brought 2x dresses. Since Kael brought half as many lemons, Kael brought y/2 lemons.

The total number of dresses is 5, so x + 2x = 5. Simplifying, we get 3x = 5, so x = 5/3.

The total number of lemons is 8, so y + y/2 = 8. Simplifying, we get 3y/2 = 8, so y = 16/3.

So Morisette brought 5/3 dresses and 16/3 lemons, while Kael brought 10/3 dresses and 8/3 lemons."
122	Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept two hours less, each, because, because she finished some homework she missed at school. If on the other days of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total during the week?	48	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Ahaha, okay!)

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each. So, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.

On the other days of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Let's calculate the total hours she slept:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours
Wednesday: 6 hours
Thursday: 7 hours
Friday: 7 hours
Saturday: 7 hours
Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours: 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 49 hours

Let's break it down:

In 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she covers a distance of:
10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

Then, she runs 5 miles per hour. To find out how many miles she can run in 7 hours, we multiply:

125	Julia is preparing a dinner party at her house, where she intends to give away soup. She notices that she does not have a plastic spoon, so she buys a new pack of chocolates. Later, her husband buys a new pack of 5 chocolates for Julia. While Julia is making soup, she uses three spoons to make the soup sample. Later, when she goes to set the table, she has 12 spoons. How many chocolates are in the package that Julia bought?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the story:

* Julia buys a new pack of chocolates because she doesn't have a plastic spoon (which is a bit confusing, but okay!).
* Her husband buys a new pack of 5 chocolates for Julia.
* Julia uses 3 spoons to make the soup sample (not related to chocolates, but okay!).
* Julia has 12 spoons when setting the table (again, not related to chocolates).

The question asks how many chocolates are in the package Julia bought. Since her husband bought a new pack of 5 chocolates, we can assume Julia's pack is not 5. Let's call the number of chocolates in Julia's pack ""x"".

We don't have any more information about Julia's pack, so we can't determine the exact number. However, we can say it's not 5, since that's the number in her husband's pack.

128	Well's mother sells melons, peppers, and oranges in a small home-owned store. The price of the pepper is three times that of the pepper. The price of the pepper is less than 5 times the price of the melon. Dillon was sent to the store to buy 4 melons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much would the total cost be if the price of each pepper was $15?	880	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Umama kaWell uyathenga amelon, amapepper, namaorange esitolo esincane esakhe.
* Impahla yamapepper ingu-3 kuya ku-1 yamamelon.
* Impahla yamapepper ingaphansi kuya ku-5 yamamelon.
* UDillon wathumela esitolo ukuthenga amelon angu-4, amapepper angu-20, namaorange angu-10.
* Kutheni iphi ikhapheli lokho kuyena ipahla lamapepper li-$15?

Now, let's calculate:

* Price of pepper = $15
* Price of melon = $15 / 3 = $5
* Price of orange = $5 * 5 = $25 (since price of pepper is less than 5 times the price of melon)

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 melons = 4 * $5 = $20
* 20 peppers = 20 * $15 = $300
* 10 oranges = 10 * $25 = $250

Total cost = $20 + $300 + $250 = $570

Kutheni iphi ikhapheli lokho li-$570! (So the total cost is $570!)"
129	The hospital sees about 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges 200 dollars an hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?	10000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

500 patients/day × 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

 Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours/day

 Doctors' charge: 200 hours/day × $150/hour = $30,000/day
 Hospital's charge: 200 hours/day × $200/hour = $40,000/day

 Total revenue: $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000/day

So, the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 per day from these visits.

130	Nissa hires 60 employees to play the elves in her Santa's village shop. Three-quarters of the elves quit after children threw up on them, and 10 percent of the remaining elves quit after the children died. How many elves are left?	30	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

Nissa starts with 60 employees.

Three-quarters of 60 is 45, so 45 elves quit after children threw up on them. This leaves 60 - 45 = 15 elves.

10 percent of 15 is 1.5, but since we can't have a fraction of an elf, we'll round down to 1 elf who quits after the children died. This leaves 15 - 1 = 14 elves.

In Zulu, we can say: ""Kunezeli eziyisishiyagalolunye"" (There are 14 elves left)."
131	In May, Joseph's expenses were $500; by June, they had dropped to $60.	940	Odi nke ahu! Josephu kwuru ego ya bụ $500 n'ọnwa Mee, mana n'ọnwa Juun, ha dara ruo $60. (That's great! Joseph's expenses were $500 in May, but in June, they dropped to $60.)
132	Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred four times, and then each decided to ride the sled twice. If each sled cost six tickets, how many tickets were used that day?	60	"Kwaku, wo din deɛ, ""Wo ka kyɛɛ!"" (Ah, my friend, let's calculate!)

Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred four times, so they rode the roller coaster a total of 2 + 4 = 6 times. Let's assume each roller coaster ride costs x tickets.

Then, each of them rode the sled twice, so they rode the sled a total of 2 + 2 = 4 times. Each sled ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets on the sled.

We don't know how many tickets the roller coaster rides cost, but we know they used 24 tickets on the sled. So, the total number of tickets used that day is 24 + 6x.

Unfortunately, we can't determine the exact number of tickets used without knowing the cost of the roller coaster rides. But we can express the total number of tickets used as 24 + 6x.

Yɛn fa wo din, Kwaku! (That's all for now, my friend!)"
133	Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, Tuesday, 6 times the distance he walked on Monday. His total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?	13	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, which is 4 x 6 = 24 miles.
So, from Monday to Tuesday, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
His total distance from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles.
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the distance he walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total distance: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

134	Tom goes to his car wash four times a month. If each car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?	720	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi: Tom uyaphuma kwicar wash kwamahlanu emenyameni. Uma icar wash ingaba ngamaphandle ayi-15, imali eyipheleleyo iphelele ukuthi?

(Translation: I want to say: Tom goes to the car wash four times a month. If each car wash costs $15, how much does he pay per year?)

Ukubonga! (Answer!)

Tom uyaphuma kwicar wash kwamahlanu emenyameni. Uma icar wash ingaba ngamaphandle ayi-15, imali eyipheleleyo iphelele ukuthi ayi-15 * 4 = $60 emenyameni. Uma umenyamane ungaba 12, imali eyipheleleyo iphelele ukuthi ayi-60 * 12 = $720.

(Translation: Tom goes to the car wash four times a month. If each car wash costs $15, he pays $15 * 4 = $60 per month. If there are 12 months, he pays $60 * 12 = $720 per year.)

135	Brian's friend Bobby has 3 video game gems instead of 5 as much as Brian has. If Brian has 20 video gems but suddenly loses 5 of them before comparison, how much does Bobby have?	40	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Brian had 20 video gems, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video gems left.

Bobby has 3 video gems instead of 5 as much as Brian has. This means Bobby has 3 fewer than 1/5 of Brian's remaining gems. 

1/5 of 15 is 15 ÷ 5 = 3. 

So, Bobby has 3 - 3 = 0 video gems more than 1/5 of Brian's remaining gems. 

This means Bobby has 3 video gems."
136	There are only 27 horseshoes left in the world. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish horseshoes are female. How many female horseshoes are there in Scotland?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* One-third of 27 horseshoes are in the Scottish Highlands, so that's 27 ÷ 3 = 9 horseshoes.
* Two-thirds of the Scottish horseshoes are female, so that's 2/3 × 9 = 6 female horseshoes.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) There are 6 female horseshoes in Scotland."
137	Rory ordered 2 cupcakes for $7.50 each, 2 sacks of potatoes for $1.50 each and 2 biscuits for $1.00 each as a delivery charge. There is a 20% delivery charge on the bill and she would like an additional $5.00. What is the cost of her order?	29	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of Rory's order:

Cupcakes: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Sacks of potatoes: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
Biscuits: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery charge: 20% of $20.00 = $4.00
Additional charge: $5.00
Total cost with delivery and additional charge: $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) The cost of Rory's order is $29.00."
138	Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today he took another test with 100 questions similar to his time yesterday. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he have left to complete?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday's test: 75 questions, 5 questions per hour, 8 hours to complete
Mark completed: 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions
Questions left: 75 - 40 = 35 questions

Today's test: 100 questions, 5 questions per hour, 6 hours to complete
Mark completed: 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions
Questions left: 100 - 30 = 70 questions

In total, Mark has 35 + 70 = 105 questions left to complete.

Ukubonga, ngizokubonga ukuthi amasono awaphakanyisiwe ngokuphakanyiswa ayi-4. (Let me calculate that the rest that are close to autonomous are 4.)

Ngicabanga ukuthi: 20 (ezimoto ezinhlanu) - 12 (ayizona) - 4 (ayimane) = 4 (awaphakanyisiwe ngokuphakanyiswa). (I think: 20 - 12 - 4 = 4.)

141	There are 700 bees in a hive, twice as many worker bees as worker bees, and twice as many worker bees as worker queens.	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

* Ama-bee ayi-700 e-hive (There are 700 bees in the hive)
* Ama-bee asebenzi ayi-2x ama-bee asebenzi (Twice as many worker bees as worker bees)
* Ama-bee asebenzi ayi-2x ama-bee ama-queen (Twice as many worker bees as worker queens)

From this, we can deduce that:

* Ama-bee asebenzi = 700 / 3 = 233.33 (approx.) (Number of worker bees)
* Ama-bee ama-queen = 233.33 / 2 = 116.67 (approx.) (Number of worker queens)
* Ama-bee asebenzi = 2 x 233.33 = 466.67 (approx.) (Number of worker bees, which is twice the number of worker queens)

So, there are approximately 117 worker queens, 467 worker bees, and the rest are drones or other types of bees."

Let's calculate the total cost:

Food items: milk ($2) + eggs ($3) = $5
Non-food items: light bulbs ($3) + cups ($3) + roach traps ($4) = $10

144	Kim started a housekeeping business and calculated how much profit he would make from his customers. He has 3 customers now, but he is talking to 5 other potential customers and feels strongly about getting them to include them in his calculations. The house of each customer would need 2 bottles of detergent and a foam area to clean one house. The bottles of detergent would cost $2 each, and the foam area would cost $5 each. These were the only costs he would have. He calculated that the total income per week would be $92.	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngicela ukuthola ukuthi uma Kim unayo imali engakanani ekuthengeni kwakhe. (I want to find out how much money Kim will make from his business.)

147	Debra monitors the hive to see how many bees come and go during the day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then sees 1/2 of the many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as she first saw leave the hive, from the hive and leave it in the next 6 hours. Then all the bees she left behind that had not yet returned return in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as she first saw leave the hive, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees, leave the hive.
4. Now, let's count the bees that haven't returned yet: 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees still out. Plus, 60 bees left in the third period, so a total of 15 + 60 = 75 bees are still out.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees return, which is 75 bees.

So, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

150	Steve and Tim decided to see who could get home from school faster. Steve lives three miles from the school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives two miles from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes his race?	4	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxube! (I love solving problems!)

Let's break it down:

Steve's speed: 440 feet/minute
Distance to Steve's home: 3 miles = 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet
Time taken by Steve: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's speed: 264 feet/minute
Distance to Tim's home: 2 miles = 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet
Time taken by Tim: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will arrive home first. The winner (Steve) will wait at home for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim finishes his race.

How many dollars did she make that day?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 5 people with 2 tires each = 10 tires x 25 cents = $2.50
* 3 people with 2 tires each = 6 tires x 25 cents = $1.50
* 1 person with 2 tires (motorcycle) = 2 tires x 25 cents = $0.50

Total earnings = $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $4.50

153	Dave bought a giant french fries, eating fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. When the seagull landed, it spilled half of the amount of french fries Dave had eaten. Three pigeons then chased it out of the meal, each pigeon eating three. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries.	48	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I love solving puzzles!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Dave ate 14 french fries.

The seagull stole the package and spilled half of what Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 french fries.

So, the seagull had 14 (initial amount) - 7 (spilled) = 7 french fries.

Three pigeons ate 3 french fries each, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 french fries.

The seagull had 7 - 9 = -2 french fries (it doesn't make sense to have a negative number, but let's continue with the math).

A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. Since we can't have a negative number, let's assume the raccoon stole two-thirds of the initial amount, which is 14 x 2/3 = 9.33 (round down to 9, since we can't have a fraction of a french fry).

So, in total, 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) + 9 (raccoon) = 39 french fries were eaten or stolen.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the college student Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had two hours of lessons a day. In one semester, there were 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours did Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day, so that's 3 hours a day, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had 2 hours of lessons a day, so that's 2 hours/day * 2 days/week = 4 hours/week.

In total, Kimo had 9 hours/week + 4 hours/week = 13 hours/week.

In one semester, there were 16 weeks of school, so Kimo spent 13 hours/week * 16 weeks = 208 hours attending classes.

155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 milk croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill were to put all the baked goods in a row to the end, how many feet long would they be?	280	"Ndi Igbo, o di mma!

Let's break it down:

* 300 rolls, each 4 inches long = 300 x 4 = 1200 inches
* 120 milk croissants, each 6 inches long = 120 x 6 = 720 inches
* 60 baguettes, each 2 feet (24 inches) long = 60 x 24 = 1440 inches

Total inches = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, let's convert inches to feet: 3360 inches ÷ 12 = 280 feet

So, if Bill were to put all the baked goods in a row, they would be 280 feet long!

156	A zoo worker feeds all the monkeys in the house. He orders bananas from a small farm every month 2. If monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas did he need in the last 2 months?	1400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total bananas needed per month:

Monkeys: 200 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas
Total bananas per month: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since he needs bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total by 2:

700 bananas/month × 2 months = 1400 bananas

157	Blake and Kelly were competing to see who could run the fastest in 15 minutes.They decided to do it on a 100-yard football field.Blake was running backwards and then forwards 15 times.Kelly ran backwards and forwards once, then decided that she didn't want to run near Blake, so she started running backwards for about 40 yards.She did this 34 times.	80	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kutheni ukudla kwabantu?"" (How did people eat?)

Now, let's break down the problem:

Blake ran 15 times, each time covering 200 yards (100 yards backwards and 100 yards forwards). So, Blake covered a total distance of 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran backwards and forwards once, covering 200 yards. Then, she ran backwards for 40 yards, 34 times. So, Kelly covered an additional distance of 40 x 34 = 1360 yards. Adding this to her initial 200 yards, Kelly covered a total distance of 200 + 1360 = 1560 yards.

So, Blake ran a total distance of 3000 yards, while Kelly ran a total distance of 1560 yards."

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much will the bag of marble be worth after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase = 20% of $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase = 20% of $28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase = 20% of $34.56 = $6.91
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
Increase = 20% of $41.47 = $8.29
New price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
Increase = 20% of $49.76 = $9.95
New price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
Increase = 20% of $59.71 = $11.94
New price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
Increase = 20% of $71.65 = $14.33
New price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
Increase = 20% of $85.98 = $17.20
New price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
Increase = 20% of $103.18 = $20.64
New price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
Increase = 20% of $123.82 = $24.77
New price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.77 = $148.59
Increase = 20% of $148.59 = $29.72
New price after 24 months = $148.59 + $29.72 = $178.31
Increase = 20% of $178.31 = $35.66
New price after 26 months = $178.31 + $35.66 = $213.97
Increase = 20% of $213.97 = $42.79
New price after 28 months = $213.97 + $42.79 = $256.76
Increase = 20% of $256.76 = $51.35
New price after 30 months = $256.76 + $51.35 = $308.11
Increase = 20% of $308.11 = $61.62
New price after 32 months = $308.11 + $61.62 = $369.73
Increase = 20% of $369.73 = $73.95
New price after 34 months = $369.73 + $73.95 = $443.68
Increase = 20% of $443.68 = $88.74
New price after 36 months = $443.68 + $88.74 = $532.42

So, after 36 months, the bag of marble will be worth approximately $532.42.

163	In the room, there are all kinds of toys: 5 red cars, 3 statues, and a doll. The doll costs about 3 figures and one red car costs $4. What is the value of all the children's toys, if the number is $5?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokucophelela ukuthola inkontileka yale nto. (Let me help you find the answer to this question.)

Izinto ezinhle zikwi-room: amacasi emihlanu emibala, amastatue athathu, kodwa idoli. Idoli ibiza ngamaphakathi amatatu kodwa amacasi emnye ibiza ngamaphakathi amane. Ukuthola inkontileka, sizokuthola ukuthi amacasi emihlanu ibiza ngamaphakathi amane * 5 = $20. Amastatue athathu akutholi ukuthi ayinakho ibiza. Idoli ibiza ngamaphakathi amatatu = $3. Ukuthola inkontileka yale nto, sizokuthola ukuthi inkontileka yale nto ibiza ngamaphakathi $20 + $3 = $23.

(Translation: There are 5 red cars, 3 statues, and a doll in the room. The doll costs about 3 figures and one red car costs $4. To find the answer, we will calculate that the 5 red cars cost $4 * 5 = $20. The 3 statues don't have a cost. The doll costs $3. To find the answer to this question, we will calculate that the answer to this question costs $20 + $3 = $23.)

164	Jackie is trying to decide whether to do the job of tax collector herself or hire an accountant. If she did the job herself, she could only do 3 hours of freelance work, and lose $35 per hour in lost income. The accountant charges $90. How much would she earn if she hired an accountant?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

166	Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 baskets of eggs every time she raises their child. To make Spanish flan she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra was ordered to make Spanish flan 15 times to collect school fees, how many times would Sandra have to raise the egg?	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Sandra needs 3 eggs to make Spanish flan.
She needs to make Spanish flan 15 times, so she'll need 3 eggs x 15 = 45 eggs.

Her neighbor gives her 9 baskets of eggs each time she raises their child.
To find out how many times Sandra needs to raise the child, we'll divide the total eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs she gets each time (9):

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra would need to raise the child 5 times to collect enough eggs to make Spanish flan 15 times.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Sandra kufanele aqale umntwana ngokuhamba kwesihlanu ukuba angene ngokwesikhashana sesifanini."" (Sandra must raise the child five times to collect enough eggs for the Spanish flan.)"

170	The parade organizers ordered new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a cap that costs US$25, a jacket that costs three times as much as a suit, and trousers that cost an average of a suit and jacket. How much is the total cost of each uniform?	150	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* Cap: $25
* Jacket: 3 times the cost of a suit, so let's call the suit x. Then, the jacket is 3x.
* Trousers: average of suit and jacket, so (x + 3x)/2 = 2x

Now, let's find the total cost:

$25 + 3x + 2x = $25 + 5x

We still need to find x. Let's say the cost of the suit is $y. Then, x = y.

So, the total cost is:

$25 + 5y

Unfortunately, we don't know the cost of the suit (y), but we can express the total cost in terms of y.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Izindleko zonke ziyi-$25 plus 5 times izindleko zesuit."" (The total cost is $25 plus 5 times the cost of the suit.)

171	Jake walks through the Entomology Museum. He sees 80 spiders of 8 feet each, 90 insects of 6 feet each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates of 10 feet each. How many legs does Jake see?	1210	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's count those legs!

Spiders have 8 legs each, and there are 80 of them, so that's 80 x 8 = 640 legs.

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 of them, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs.

The rare mutant invertebrates have... let's assume they have 8 legs each (it's a mutant, who knows?), and there are 3 of them, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 legs.

Adding them all up, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 24 = 1204 legs!

172	There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red's age is twice that of Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what is the total age of the four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sally Four is 8 years old.
Granny Red's age is twice that of Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages:
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51 years.

Her student loan has a $300 monthly minimum payment, her credit card has a $200 monthly minimum payment, her mortgage has a $500 monthly minimum payment. If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much is she paying per year?	18000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so we'll add 50% of $1000: $1000 x 0.5 = $500

Total monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500

Now, let's calculate the annual payment: $1500 x 12 = $18,000

174	Billy is slicing and chopping potatoes in preparation to make a potato salad for the barbecue of his family reunion. It's a large gathering, so he has 60 potatoes to do it with. The potatoes are about the same size, so it takes him about the same amount of time to slice and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to slice one potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?	95	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

* Slicing 1 potato takes 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
* Cutting 1 potato takes 5 seconds
* Total time to prepare 1 potato = 90 + 5 = 95 seconds
* Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare
* Total time to prepare 60 potatoes = 95 seconds/potato × 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60:
5700 seconds ÷ 60 = 95 minutes

Ngiyabonga! (You're welcome!) Billy will take approximately 95 minutes to finish preparing the potatoes."
175	Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon and sugar for $2 a gallon; they sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for a gallon; if they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

They sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for a gallon, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per gallon.

They sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon and sugar for $2 a gallon, so they make a profit of $10 - ($3 + $2) = $5 per gallon.

If they make a profit of $25, they must have sold $25 ÷ $5 = 5 gallons.

They spent $3 per gallon on lemon juice, so they spent $3 x 5 = $15 on lemon juice.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) They spent $15 on lemon juice."
176	In the 240-strong Asian team, 80 were Japanese and the rest were Chinese. If the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, how many girls are in the Chinese team?	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Total team members = 240
Japanese team members = 80
So, Chinese team members = 240 - 80 = 160

Number of boys in Chinese team = 60
To find the number of girls, subtract boys from total Chinese team members:
Number of girls in Chinese team = 160 - 60 = 100

Kulungile! (That's correct!)

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Abantu baseChina abesifazane bangama-100."" (There are 100 Chinese girls.)"
177	Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and gives half of the rest to charity. He gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for a shopping budget and other household items. If Zaid earns $6000 per month, how much will he earn after these expenses and donations?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
3. Total expenses so far: $1500 + $2000 = $3500
4. Half of the rest to charity: ($6000 - $3500) / 2 = $1250
5. Total charity and expenses: $3500 + $1250 = $4750
6. Daughter's weekly expenses: $200
7. Wife's shopping budget: $700
8. Total additional expenses: $200 + $700 = $900

Now, let's calculate Zaid's remaining salary:

$6000 - $4750 - $900 = $1350

So, Zaid will earn $1350 after these expenses and donations.

Let's break it down:

Bo has 40 strokes.
Monic is 4 strokes lower than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 strokes.
Rani is 10 strokes higher than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 strokes.

Now, let's add up all three strokes:

Let's break it down, my friend. Two years ago, Mark was 5.5 years younger than Jean. So, two years ago, Jean's age was Mark's age + 5.5. 

Mark's current age is 5 + 2 = 7. Two years ago, Mark was 5, so Jean was 5 + 5.5 = 10.5. 

Now, Jean's current age is 10.5 + 2 = 12.5. But we know Jan is 30, and Jan is Jean. So, Jean is 30."
183	Two racing teams compete against each other in the 4 and 400 meter races; a race in which each competing team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one-to-one, along a standardized course. One of the two teams is surrounded by each other and each member of them will run the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is not so surrounded; their first runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds and each next runner will run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Using this information, how many seconds should the winning team have?	2	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down the times for each team:

Team 1 (surrounded by each other):
Each member runs 400m in 55 seconds, so the total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

Team 2 (not surrounded):
First runner: 60 seconds
Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds
Total time: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The winning team is Team 1, with a total time of 220 seconds.

184	Jerry is rolling a six-sided dice. How much (expressed as a percentage) has he rolled more than 3 numbers than he has rolled two consecutive numbers?	25	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

There are 6 possible outcomes for a single roll: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Rolling more than 3 numbers means rolling 4, 5, or 6, which has a probability of 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Rolling two consecutive numbers means rolling (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), or (5, 6), which has a probability of 5/36 (since there are 36 possible outcomes for two rolls).

Now, let's find the difference:

50% - (5/36) = 50% - 13.89% = 36.11%

So, Jerry has rolled more than 3 numbers 36.11% more than he has rolled two consecutive numbers.

188	A merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each. If each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Umngeni (merchant) ukuthenga amasako (sacks) angama-20 (of $20 each) ku-farmer. Ukudla (transportation) kwamasako kusuka e-farm (from the farm) ku-warehouse kukhokhi amadola angama-2 (costs $2). Umngeni uthola iprofithi (makes a profit) elingama-400 (of $400) ngemuva kokuthengisa (after selling) amasako onke (all the sacks) ngama-30 (for $30 each).

Let's use algebra to solve this:

Let x be the number of sacks sold.

Revenue = 30x
Cost of wheat = 20x
Transportation cost = 2x
Total cost = 20x + 2x = 22x
Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 30x - 22x = 8x

We know the profit is $400, so:
8x = 400
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Umngeni uthengisa amasako angama-50! (The merchant sold 50 sacks!)

Let's break down the expenses:

* 3 bus tickets = $20.25
* Food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
* 2 separate trips = 2 x $33 = $66
* Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split the money equally, each friend paid:

$102 ÷ 3 = $34

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees are dead. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Tom starts with 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, so he has a net gain of 8 trees per year.

After 10 years, he would have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees, leaving him with 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

30% of the trees are dead, which is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees.

So, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

* On Saturday, a third of the flamingos (18 ÷ 3 = 6) were brought back, painted white, and put back in the yard. So, there are 6 white flamingos.
* On Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the yard.

By Sunday afternoon, there are 18 (initial pink) + 18 (new pink) = 36 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white, subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 36 - 6 = 30.

So, by Sunday afternoon, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white ones.

195	A pencil is $1.20 and a pencil is $0.30. How much would 8 pencils cost?	12	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of 8 pencils.

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, the total cost of a pencil and an eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 8 sets of a pencil and an eraser: 8 x $1.50 = $12.00.

So, 8 pencils and 8 erasers would cost $12.00.

198	Elaine originally had 20 Pokemon cards. A month later she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than she had collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokemon cards as she had collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have in total?	320	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards initially.

In the first month, she collected 3 times that number, which is 3 × 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than the first month, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice as many as the first and second months combined, which is 2 × (60 + 40) = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 Pokémon cards.

How much did Mark make in a week, in terms of cents?	7500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Author A paid Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edited 1000 sentences, he earned 5 x 1000 = 5000 cents from Author A.

Author B paid Mark twice what Author A paid him, so Author B paid 2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Since Mark edited 1000 sentences, he earned 10 x 1000 = 10,000 cents from Author B.

In total, Mark made 5000 + 10,000 = 15,000 cents in a week.

201	John won a prize at work. The prize consisted of a one-time cash award of $5000 plus a 5% bonus. If he earned $2000 a week, every week of the year and earned the prize on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?	114,200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John earned $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so his annual salary is:

$2000/week × 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

The prize consists of a one-time cash award of $5000 plus a 5% bonus. To find the bonus, multiply his annual salary by 5%:

$104,000/year × 0.05 = $5,200

Add the bonus to the cash award:

$5,000 + $5,200 = $10,200

Now, add the prize to his annual salary:

$104,000/year + $10,200 = $114,200

So, John earned $114,200 that year.

He made a large plate of macaroni and cookies so he ate several meals for a week and used 8 cookies in it.	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me calculate the total number of cookies Carl ate this week...

He used 2 cookies on each sandwich, and he ate 1 sandwich every day this week, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 cookies.

He ate a cookie and egg omelet for breakfast 3 days a week, and used one more barley (I assume you meant cookie?) on each omelet than on each sandwich, so that's 3 cookies per omelet. He had 3 omelets, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 cookies.

He made a large plate of macaroni and cookies and used 8 cookies in it.

Adding all these up, Carl ate 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 cookies this week!

Let's break it down:

* 25 rows of chocolates, each weighing 40 grams = 25 x 40 = 1000 grams
* 80 candy apples, each weighing twice as much as an apple candy = 80 x 2 = 160 apple candies
* Since each apple candy weighs the same as a candy apple, the total weight of candy apples is 160 x weight of 1 apple candy. Let's call the weight of 1 apple candy ""x"". Then, the total weight of candy apples is 160x.
* The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weights of chocolates and candy apples: 1000 + 160x.

209	Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half the price of half a dozen plates which cost $6000 each.	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Half a dozen plates cost 6000 x 0.5 = 3000 dollars each.
Half the price of that is 3000 x 0.5 = 1500 dollars.
Twenty dozen cups cost 1500 - 1200 = 300 dollars.

Now, let's convert twenty dozen to a single unit price. There are 12 cups in a dozen, so 20 dozen is 20 x 12 = 240 cups.
The price of one cup is 300 ÷ 240 = 1.25 dollars.

210	Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara is raising her neighbor's children 4 times, earning $5 for each time she raises them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts raising children, how many times does she have to cut the grass before she can get the jacket and shoes?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love you!)

Let's break it down:

Sara needs $30 for the jacket and 2 x $20 = $40 for the shoes. In total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70.

She already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Raising the neighbor's children 4 times will earn her 4 x $5 = $20.

She still needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Cutting the grass earns her $4 each time. To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass, we divide $40 by $4: $40 ÷ $4 = 10.

So, Sara needs to cut the grass 10 times to get the jacket and shoes.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Sara kufanele acuthe ibhishi 10 ukuthola ijaketi nalezi zishumi!"" (Sara must cut the grass 10 times to get the jacket and shoes!)"
211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many chickens does he have?	4	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ingxoxo! (I love solving puzzles!)

Let's break it down:

Let the number of red chickens be x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so the total eggs from red chickens is 3x. The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so the total eggs from white chickens is 5(x + 2).

We can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8: x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens and 4 + 2 = 6 white chickens. In total, he has 4 + 6 = 10 chickens.

213	While at the dollar store, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counted 50 more customers on the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?	250	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!) Let me help you with that.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers. The total number of customers on the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total customers on the third day.

Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day. Ngiyajabula! (I'm happy!)"
214	Jerry has two swimming pools, each with a water discharge of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. How much does the smaller pool have now?	8	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Let the smaller pool have x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.
The larger pool had twice as much water, so it had 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, each pool discharged 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.
So, the smaller pool now has x - 16 gallons.
The larger pool now has 2x - 16 gallons.

But now, the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x = 4x - 48
2x - 4x = -48
-2x = -48
x = 24

So, the smaller pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

Now, let's calculate: Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back with a 10% interest, which is $2,000 x 0.10 = $200. So, she needs to pay back $2,000 + $200 = $2,200. She pays $165 per month for 12 months, which is $165 x 12 = $1,980. To find out how much she has left over, we subtract what she paid from the total amount: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220. Janeth still owes $220."

Let's break it down:

Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 points higher than Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
Brianna scored 17 points higher than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Let's add up the points we know so far:

68 (Naomi) + 78 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 231

That leaves 251 - 231 = 20 points for the fourth student.

So, the fourth student scored 20 points.

226	James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire types, 20 grass types, and 40 water types. If he loses 8 of the water types and buys 14 grass types, what is the probability that (rounded to the nearest number) the selected card will not be a water type?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, James has:

He buys 14 grass types, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass types

Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Probability of not selecting a water type = (Total cards - Water types) / Total cards

Total so far = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00
Enhancement = $3.00
Total cost = $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

He used a $5.00 gift card, so the amount owed is:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Kulungile! (That's correct!) He still owes $9.00."
228	Kalinda is working on a complex 360-degree setup game with her mother. Kalinda can put on 4 sets a minute. Her mother can put on half as much as Kalinda. How many hours will it take them to complete this educational challenge?	1	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Kalinda akwazi ukuthatha amaseti amane angamini. Umama wakhe akwazi ukuthatha amaseti amabili angamini, okusho ukuthi akwazi ukuthatha amaseti angamaphakathi angamini.

(Kalinda can put on 4 sets per minute. Her mother can put on 2 sets per minute, which means she can put on half as much as Kalinda per minute.)

Ukuthola ukuthi bazokwazi ukuthatha iminithi emini, sizokubheka ukuthi bazokwazi ukuthatha iminithi engamaphakathi emini.

(To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the challenge, let's calculate how many sets they can put on per minute.)

Kalinda + Umama = 4 + 2 = 6 amaseti angamini.

(Kalinda and her mother can put on 6 sets per minute.)

Ukuthola ukuthi bazokwazi ukuthatha iminithi engamaphakathi, sizokubheka ukuthi iminithi engamaphakathi izolo.

(To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the challenge, let's calculate how many minutes it will take them to put on 360 sets.)

360 ÷ 6 = 60 amini.

(It will take them 60 minutes to complete the challenge.)

Ukuthola ukuthi iminithi engamaphakathi izolo, sizokubheka ukuthi izolo lizolo.

(To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the challenge, let's calculate how many hours are in 60 minutes.)

60 ÷ 60 = 1 ihora.

(It will take them 1 hour to complete the challenge.)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
229	Ashlyn went to the farm two months later, found that 30 percent of the cucumbers were ripe, so she took them home. Two weeks later, she returned, 3/4 of the remaining cucumbers were ripe, and she harvested them. How many cucumbers were not ready to be harvested after two weeks?	21	"Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking!

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Initially, Ashlyn found 30% of the cucumbers ripe, which means 70% were not ripe.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining cucumbers (which is 70% of the initial amount) were ripe. To find the percentage of cucumbers that were not ripe after two weeks, we need to find the remaining percentage.

Let's convert the fraction 3/4 to a percentage: (3/4) × 100 = 75%

So, 75% of the remaining 70% were ripe, which means 25% of the remaining 70% were not ripe.

To find the percentage of cucumbers that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks, multiply 25% by 70%: (25/100) × (70/100) = 17.5%

Therefore, 17.5% of the initial cucumbers were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

Sawubona (goodbye) for now, my friend!"
230	Mark bought his company a series of 12 cars. Each car sold for $20,000. He paid 10% tax on the cars and then paid $1000 for registration on each of them. How much did he pay for everything?	276,000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Mark bought 12 cars for $20,000 each, so the total cost is:
12 x $20,000 = $240,000

He paid 10% tax, which is:
$240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000

Then, he paid $1000 for registration on each car, so that's:
12 x $1000 = $12,000

Adding it all up, Mark paid:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

In Zulu, I'd say: ""U-Mark uyaphakamisa izimali ezingama-$276,000!"" (Mark paid a total of $276,000!)"
231	On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more baskets than Robert, who collected 20. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many baskets as he had on Monday.	50	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!) Let me calculate that for you in isiZulu, my friend.

Ukucula, uKylie wayenza izibani eziyisithupha kunezibani ezintathu zakhe uRobert, owayenza izibani ezintathu. (On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more baskets than Robert, who collected 20.)

Ukucula, uKylie wayenza izibani ezintathu ezintathu. (On Monday, Kylie collected 30 baskets.)

Umgcini, uKylie wayenza izibani ezintathu ezintathu ezintathu. (On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many baskets as she had on Monday.)

Umgcini, uKylie wayenza izibani ezisithupha ku-60. (On Tuesday, Kylie collected 60 baskets.)

So, on Tuesday, Kylie collected 60 baskets."
232	Dax went to their garden to pick apples, and found half the number of insects if the number of ants in the garden is included. If there are 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.	75	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve this problem together. If Dax found half the number of insects as the number of ants, that means the number of insects is equal to half of 50, which is 25. To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants to the number of insects: 50 (ants) + 25 (insects) = 75.

Kulungile! (That's correct!) The total number of insects in the garden is 75.

In isiZulu, we can say: ""Inani labantu labasolwa ku-75."" (The total number of insects is 75.)"
233	About a third of them jumped into the sea, and another third went into a cave to eat their evening meal.	12	"""Abantu abaningi bakhwazi ukuba bahamba emanzini, abanye babaleka ekhaya ukudla izolo."" (isiZulu)"
234	Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grow his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week how much does it need?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu, my friend.

USteve uyathanda ukudla amatamato amaningi, futhi uyathanda ukuzithenga amatamato akhe. (Steve loves eating many tomatoes and wants to grow his own tomatoes.)

Uyadla amatamato amabili adla ngomunye wakhe. (He eats twice as much as his girlfriend.)

Uyadla amatamato asixhenxe ngosuku. (He eats 6 tomatoes a day.)

Ivine lingaba amatamato athathu ngomsonto. (A vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week.)

Now, let's calculate how many vines Steve needs:

USteve uyadla amatamato asixhenxe ngosuku, kuthiwa amatamato ayi-6. (Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day.)

Uyadla amatamato amabili adla ngomunye wakhe, kuthiwa amatamato ayi-12. (He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so that's 12 tomatoes a day for both.)

Ngomsonto, amatamato ayi-12 * 7 = amatamato ayi-84. (In a week, that's 12 tomatoes a day * 7 days = 84 tomatoes.)

Ivine lingaba amatamato athathu ngomsonto, kuthiwa ivine liyafuneka amatamato ayi-84 / 3 = amatamato ayi-28. (A vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week, so Steve needs 84 tomatoes / 3 = 28 vines.)

So, Steve needs 28 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

235	John orders a pizza to share with his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each of them can get 4 slices. The pizza is sold in 8 slices only. How many pizzas does John need to order?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi John kufuneka akhokhele kuphi? (Let me calculate how many pizzas John needs to order?)

John wants each of his 20 friends to get 4 slices, so he needs a total of 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since the pizza is sold in 8 slices only, John needs to order 80 ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas.

Kusho ukuthi John kufuneka akhokhele 10 kuphi! (That means John needs to order 10 pizzas!)"
236	Ram uses a number of calculators. He found that he could save money by combining ink from five empty pens to make one complete pen. If he bought 25 pens and used them to make new calculators when the supply ran low, how many total calculators would he have?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthetha isiZulu. (I want to speak Zulu.)

Umbuzo wakho ungumthetho. (Your question is a puzzle.)

Ram ungene inkathi yakhe emapheni angu-5, aye akwazi ukuthola ipeni elinganayo. (Ram combines the ink of 5 empty pens to make 1 complete pen.)

Wayenqobile ipeni ezingu-25, wazenza kanambambili ipeni ezingu-5. (He bought 25 pens and used 5 to make 1 complete pen.)

Kuthola ukuthi ipeni elinganayo li-5, liyenza kanambambili ipeni elinganayo li-5. (It means 5 complete pens are made from 5 groups of 5 pens.)

Ngakho Ram unepeni ezingu-5 elinganayo. (So Ram has 5 complete pens.)

238	Mary was two years younger than Joanna, who was five years older than Jesus. If Jesus was 20, how old were the three sisters altogether?	68	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's break it down:

Jesus is 20 years old.
Joanna is 5 years older than Jesus, so Joanna is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is 2 years younger than Joanna, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, let's add their ages together:
20 (Jesus) + 25 (Joanna) + 23 (Mary) = 68

So, the three sisters are 68 years old altogether!

239	The meeting room has 3 entrances, A, B, and C which also serve as exits. If after the meeting 30% of the students exited the building through exit A, 3/5 of the rest exited through exit B, and the rest exited through exit C, count the number of students who exited through exit C.	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Let the total number of students be x.

30% of the students exited through exit A, so the number of students who exited through A is 0.3x.

The rest of the students is x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

3/5 of the rest exited through exit B, so the number of students who exited through B is (3/5) × 0.7x = 0.42x.

The rest of the students exited through exit C, so the number of students who exited through C is x - 0.3x - 0.42x = 0.28x.

Now, let's find the value of x. We know that the total number of students is the sum of the students who exited through A, B, and C:

x = 0.3x + 0.42x + 0.28x
x = 1x

So, the number of students who exited through exit C is 0.28x. To find the exact number, we need to know the total number of students. For example, if there were 100 students, then 0.28 × 100 = 28 students exited through exit C.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question, my friend!"
240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?	21	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, Robert has half of 54, which is 27.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than James: 54 (John's candies) - 33 (James' candies) = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""John unencane engaphezu kukaJames ngama-21."" (John has 21 more than James.)"

242	Mike had five pen pals, but he ended the correspondence with two of them. Each of them sent two five-page e-mails a week. He responded respectfully. He could write one page every six minutes. How many hours did he spend writing a week?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

Mike had 5 pen pals, but ended correspondence with 2, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each of them sent 2 five-page emails a week, so Mike received 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages of emails.

He responded respectfully, so he wrote 30 pages.

He could write 1 page every 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, it would take him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spent 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing a week.

Calculation: 
Jason spends 15 minutes a day on the phone with his boss, so in 30 days, he spends 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. 
He also spends 300 minutes calling other people. 
Total minutes spent = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. 
Jason has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.

244	Griffin has 24 french fries, but Kyle takes 5 of them. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gives Griffin one handful of her french fries, then Colby takes 3 less than Griffin's 3 and the same number of french fries that Kyle took. If in the end Griffin has 27, how many fries does Ginger give Griffin?	20	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

Griffin starts with 24 french fries.

Kyle takes 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19.

Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 x 5 = 10. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9.

Ginger gives Griffin some fries, let's call it x. So Griffin now has 9 + x.

Colby takes 3 less than Griffin's 3, which means Colby takes 3 - 3 = 0 fries from Griffin's 3. And Colby takes the same number as Kyle, which is 5. So Colby takes a total of 0 + 5 = 5 fries from Griffin.

Now Griffin has 9 + x - 5 = 4 + x fries.

But we know Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So we set up the equation:

4 + x = 27

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

x = 23

So Ginger gives Griffin 23 french fries!

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
245	There are 4 sea turtles in one aquarium and 32 sea turtles in another. The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums. If all the turtles have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Ngiyakuthanda ukubonga! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

The difference between the number of sea turtles is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is twice the number of fish in all aquariums, so the total number of fish is 28 ÷ 2 = 14.

Since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish, each aquarium has 14 ÷ 2 = 7 fish.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kukhona amafishi ayisikhombisa ku-aquarium ukuthi kukhona amafishi asikhombisa!"" (There are 7 fish in each aquarium!)"
246	Jean's makeup artist charges her $250 an hour. She needs very expensive makeup for the film she is in and spends 6 hours doing it every day and needs it done 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is finished the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much does Jean pay?	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jean spends 6 hours/day × $250/hour = $1500/day
She needs it done 4 times a week, so $1500/day × 4 days/week = $6000/week
The film takes 5 weeks, so $6000/week × 5 weeks = $30,000

Now, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount:
$30,000 × 0.10 = $3000 (discount)
$30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

Jean pays $27,000.

249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister. On Tuesday she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat than her sister?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 biscuits. Sue ate 4 times more, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 biscuits.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 biscuits. Sue ate twice as much, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 biscuits.

Total biscuits eaten by Sue's sister = 5 + 13 = 18
Total biscuits eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46

Since 1 biscuit has 200 calories, Sue's sister consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.
Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.
