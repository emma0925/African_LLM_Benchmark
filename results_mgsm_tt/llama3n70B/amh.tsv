0	Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats three for breakfast every day and shares four of them with her friends every day. She sells the rest at the farmers' market for $2 a day for each fresh duck egg.	18	"Nkɔsoɔ nkɔsoɔ! (Okay, okay!)

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. She shares 4 with her friends, so 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells the rest at the farmers' market for $2 a day for each fresh duck egg. So she sells 9 eggs for $2 each, which is 9 x $2 = $18 a day.

2	Josh decided to move house. He bought the house for $80,000 and had it renovated for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150 percent.	70000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngoku, ukuthola ukuthi iphi imali eyenziwe ngumzali wakhe? (Now, let's calculate the value of the house after renovation.)

Imali yokuthenga ihlala ligama $80,000. Ukucopheleleyo kwaba ngamaphesenti angu-150. Kuyafana ukuthi iphi imali yokucopheleleyo? (The purchase price was $80,000. The renovation increased the value by 150%. What is the new value?)

Imali yokucopheleleyo = Imali yokuthenga x (1 + 150/100)

5	Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kyler wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should he pay for them?	64	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1st glass = $5
2nd glass = $5 x 0.6 = $3
3rd glass = $5 x 0.6 = $3

6	Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle. How many bars do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined, if Seattle has 20 bars?	260	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Seattle has 20 bars.
Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 bars.
Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 bars.

Combined, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 bars.

Translation:
Hello! So Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download 2 GB per minute, but at 40% of the installation path, Windows Update disappears and requires a restart, which takes 20 minutes. So Carla has to restart the download from scratch.

To solve the problem, let's break it down:

1. Carla can download 2 GB/min, so to download 200 GB, it will take:
200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes

2. However, at 40% of the installation path, Windows Update disappears, and she has to restart. 40% of 200 GB is:
200 GB x 0.4 = 80 GB

So, she has downloaded 80 GB in:
80 GB / 2 GB/min = 40 minutes

3. After the restart, which takes 20 minutes, she has to restart the download from scratch. Therefore, the total time it will take Carla to download the 200 GB file is:
40 minutes (downloaded before restart) + 20 minutes (restart time) + 100 minutes (total download time) = 160 minutes

Answer: 160 minutes."
8	He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours standing in a traffic jam. He spends the next half hour driving at 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. At the end of those 4 hours, how far away is he from home?	45	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

He spends 2 hours in a traffic jam, so he doesn't move at all.

Then, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour. Distance = speed × time, so he covers a distance of:

30 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

After that, he drives for 4 hours at 80 miles per hour. He covers a distance of:

80 miles/hour × 4 hours = 320 miles

In total, he has covered a distance of:

15 miles + 320 miles = 335 miles

So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is 335 miles away from home.

11	Tula went to the bakery and bought a variety of pastries. She bought three dozen doughnuts, each for $68, two dozen small cupcakes, each for $80, and six dozen small cheesecakes, each for $55.	694	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Tula's pastries:

* 3 dozen doughnuts = 3 x 12 = 36 doughnuts
* Cost of doughnuts = 36 x $68 = $2448
* 2 dozen small cupcakes = 2 x 12 = 24 cupcakes
* Cost of cupcakes = 24 x $80 = $1920
* 6 dozen small cheesecakes = 6 x 12 = 72 cheesecakes
* Cost of cheesecakes = 72 x $55 = $3960
* Total cost = $2448 + $1920 + $3960 = $8328

Kubonga! (Well done!) Tula spent a total of $8328 on pastries.

14	In a dance class of 20 students, 20% were enrolled in modern dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the total students were enrolled in hip-hop dance?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

20% of 20 students = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students (modern dance)
25% of 20 students = 0.25 x 20 = 5 students (jazz dance)

Total students in modern and jazz dance = 4 + 5 = 9 students

Students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total students - Students in modern and jazz dance
= 20 - 9
= 11 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (11 / 20) x 100%
= 55%

Kulungile! (That's correct!) 55% of the students were enrolled in hip-hop dance."
15	A trader wants to make a choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. The financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% in the same month and the electronics market will increase by 1.2%. If the trader wants to increase his profit by making a choice at the end of this month, how much profit will this be?	125	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = $125
New value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = $96
New value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the trader wants to increase profit, they should choose the jewelry option, which yields a profit of $125.

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 an hour to be a motivational coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her annual salary?	57500	"Ehe, ndi ofuma! (Ah, let me calculate!)

As a teacher, Jill earns $20/hour and works 35 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
$20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week

As a coach, Jill earns $30/hour and works 15 hours/week. So, her weekly earnings as a coach are:
$30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week

Her total weekly earnings are:
$700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
$1150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

18	claire makes 3 egg omelets for breakfast every morning. how many dozen eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning, which means she uses 3 eggs per day.
In 1 week, she will use 3 eggs/day × 7 days = 21 eggs.
In 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs/week × 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Now, let's convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen, so:
84 eggs ÷ 12 = 7 dozen eggs.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step, my friend.

Initially, you have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange juice, multiply 10 liters by 2/3:

10 liters × 2/3 = 6.67 liters of water (approximately)

Now, you add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple juice, multiply 15 liters by 3/5:

15 liters × 3/5 = 9 liters of water

But wait, you accidentally pour out 1 liter of orange juice! So, subtract 1 liter from the initial 10 liters:

10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters of orange juice remaining

The amount of water in the remaining orange juice is:

9 liters × 2/3 = 6 liters of water (approximately)

Now, combine the water from the remaining orange juice and the pineapple juice:

6 liters (orange juice) + 9 liters (pineapple juice) = 15 liters of water

So, in the remaining 24 liters, there are approximately 15 liters of water.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question, my friend!"

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Samantha is 31 years old now, and Raymond is 6 years older than her, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

When Raymond was 23, he had a son. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract 23 from his current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

24	Kyle bought last year's bestseller for $19.50. That was 25% off the original price. What was the book's top selling price?	26	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's solve the problem. If the discounted price is $19.50, and it's 25% off the original price, that means the original price was 100%/75% = 4/3 of the discounted price.

Let's break down Marie's order:

* Chicken dish: $12
* 5 packs of milk: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
* Total so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
* Marie paid a total of $50, so she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on pizzas
* Each box of pizza is $8.50, so Marie ordered $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizzas

29	While shopping for shoes, Gloria found a pair that fit her shoe budget. However, she had to choose between the shoes and two pairs of heels, which together cost five dollars more than the shoes. If one pair is $33 and the other is twice as much, how much are the shoes worth?	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend!

One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Together, the two pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The shoes cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, so the shoes cost $99 - $5 = $94.

So, the shoes are worth $94.

30	Darryl's and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If they are 162 years old now, imagine Allen's age 10 years from now.	109	"Ndi Igbo! (That's ""Okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language.)

Let's break it down. If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, that means Darryl's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.

We know their combined age is 162 years, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99 years

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years.

31	Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in the bottle. He asks his friends how many jelly beans are in the bottle. One says there are 80, another says there are 20 more than the first half, and a third says there are 25% more than the first half. What is their average estimate?	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than the first half, which means 80/2 = 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says there are 25% more than the first half, which means 80/2 = 40 + 25% of 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 jelly beans.

Now, let's calculate the average estimate:

(80 + 60 + 50) / 3 = 190 / 3 = 63.33

So, their average estimate is approximately 63 jelly beans.

33	Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?	70	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend. Let the number of silver coins be x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

34	Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's. How many jewels does Raymond have if Siobhan has 40?	23	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!) Let me help you with that.

Let's break it down:

* Siobhan has 40 jewels.
* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
* Let's say Raymond has x jewels.
* Half of Raymond's jewels is x/2.
* Aaron has 5 more than that, so Aaron has x/2 + 5 jewels.
* But we know Siobhan has 40 jewels, and Aaron has the same number of jewels as Siobhan.
* So, x/2 + 5 = 40.
* Subtract 5 from both sides: x/2 = 35.
* Multiply both sides by 2: x = 70.

So, Raymond has 70 jewels!"

Let's break it down:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. To find 25% of 4, multiply 4 by 0.25, which gives you 1. So, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

In total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points.

John kuba imitoyizi yakhe konke futhi asebenzisa imali ukuthenga amagame avideo. Une-Lego sets ezithirteen, aziphatha ngama-$15 ngakutho. Ekugcineni, athenga amagame avideo asithupha ngama-$20 ngakutho, futhi ane-$5 esikhundleni.

(Translation: John sells all his toys and uses the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets, selling them for $15 each. In the end, he buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left.)

Let me calculate the total amount John got from selling his Lego sets: 13 sets x $15 each = $195

Then, he buys 8 video games for $20 each: 8 games x $20 each = $160

He has $5 left, so let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount: $195 - $160 = $35

But wait, John has $5 left, so that means he should have $35 - $5 = $30 left. However, the problem states he has $5 left. Hmm, maybe John got a discount on the video games or something?"

39	Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, but she can jump half as fast as she runs. She can leap three miles an hour. If she runs a third of the time and walks two thirds of the time, how many miles can she cover in six hours?	18	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step, my friend.

Since Dana can jump half as fast as she runs, and she can leap 3 miles an hour, that means she can run at a speed of 3 x 2 = 6 miles an hour.

Since she can run four times as fast as she walks, her walking speed is 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5 miles an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance she can cover in 6 hours. She runs for a third of the time, which is 2 hours, and walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 4 hours.

Distance covered while running = 6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance covered = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

So, Dana can cover 18 miles in 6 hours. Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"

Ukuba uCharlie eqhuba amacandle ayi-20, ukuthi ungaqhuba iphondo lebezwax eli-2 (20 ÷ 10 = 2). Iphondo lebezwax nelikwis eliyisipho sokuqala siyahluka $10.00, ukuthi isipho sakhe siyahluka $20.00 (2 x $10.00).

45	It takes an average of 4 hours to research and write a blog article. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Monday. She wrote twice as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Wednesday.	104	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times as many articles as Monday, which is 2/5 × 5 = 2 articles.
Since she wrote twice as many articles on Tuesday as on Wednesday, she wrote 2 ÷ 2 = 1 article on Wednesday.

46	On her way, she stopped by the store and bought a bundle of postcards; at work, she placed one post-it note on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If there were 23 bundles left, how many were there?	163	"Ndi Igbo m! (That's ""I understand"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's solve the problem together!

If she bought a bundle of postcards and 23 bundles were left, that means she used some bundles. Let's find out how many she used.

She placed one post-it note on each of the 220 different coffee cups. Since one post-it note is equal to one postcard, she used 220 postcards.

If 23 bundles were left, and we don't know how many postcards are in a bundle, let's call the number of postcards in a bundle ""x"". Then, the total number of postcards she had initially is 23x + 220.

Since we don't know the value of ""x"", we can't find the exact number of bundles she had initially. But we can express the answer in terms of ""x"".

So, the answer is 23x + 220/x."
47	The red ones are 50% more expensive than the blue ones. He spent $200 on the blue ones, which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on the blue ones?	800	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

He spent $200 on the blue ones, and each blue one costs $40. To find out how many blue ones he bought, we divide $200 by $40:

$200 ÷ $40 = 5

So, he bought 5 blue ones.

Now, the red ones are 50% more expensive than the blue ones. To find the price of one red one, we add 50% of $40 to $40:

$40 + ($40 × 0.5) = $40 + $20 = $60

Since he bought 5 blue ones, and the red ones are 50% more expensive, he would have spent:

5 × $60 = $300

on the red ones.

68	There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Worth's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Kunezinhlanhla ezingu-60 ezintombazane, futhi abafana abanezinhlanhla ezingu-2 ku-60, okuthiwa abafana abanezinhlanhla ezingu-120.

Ukuthola inani lezitishi, sizokwazi ukucophelela inani lezinhlanhla lezicolo ngokuthi: 120 (abafana) + 60 (ezintombazane) = 180 (ezinhlanhla lezicolo).

Ngokuba kukhona izitishi ezinhlanhla ezingu-5, sizokwazi ukucophelela inani lezitishi ngokuthi: 180 (ezinhlanhla lezicolo) ÷ 5 = 36.

Kuthiwa kukhona izitishi ezingu-36.

(Translation:

There are 60 girls, and twice as many boys as girls, which means there are 120 boys.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls: 120 (boys) + 60 (girls) = 180 (total students).

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5: 180 (total students) ÷ 5 = 36.

There are 36 teachers.)"

70	Judy teaches 5 dance classes daily on weekdays and 8 dance classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she pays $15 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?	7425	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5 classes/day × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1125/day
Total for weekdays: $1125/day × 5 days = $5625

Saturday: 8 classes × 15 students/class × $15/student = $1800

Total for 1 week: $5625 + $1800 = $7425

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Sheila bought 5 cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.
* She pays 2% interest on each unit, which is $750 x 0.02 = $15.
* The total amount she needs to pay is $750 + $15 = $765.
* Since she's paying for 3 months, she'll pay $765 ÷ 3 = $255 each month.

75	Luke spends his time building sand castles on the seashore. Eventually, he notices that each level of the sand castle is half a square meter from the level below. What is the average square foot of a four-level sand castle with an upper level of 16 square feet?	60	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step. Since each level is half a square meter from the level below, we can start from the top and work our way down.

Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
Level 2: 2 × 16 = 32 square feet
Level 3: 2 × 32 = 64 square feet
Level 4: 2 × 64 = 128 square feet

Now, let's find the total area: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

To find the average, divide the total area by the number of levels: 240 ÷ 4 = 60 square feet

So, the average square foot of a four-level sand castle with an upper level of 16 square feet is 60 square feet.

76	According to her veterinarian, for the first 180 days of her life, the puppy should be fed 1 cup of dog food a day. Then for the rest of her life, she should be fed 2 cups of dog food a day. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?	5	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down:

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day, so she'll need:
180 days x 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), she'll need 2 cups of dog food per day, so she'll need:
185 days x 2 cups/day = 370 cups

In total, Cecilia will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year.

Since a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need:
550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food

Let's break it down:

Sarah washes 400 pounds.
David washes 1/4 of what Sarah washes, so David washes 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.
Raymond washes half of what Sarah washes, so Raymond washes 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

78	Vincent buys 3 bouquets for $2.50 or 2 bouquets for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at a lower price?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

3 bouquets for $2.50 means 1 bouquet costs $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.83
2 bouquets for $1 means 1 bouquet costs $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50

Vincent saves $0.83 - $0.50 = $0.33 per bouquet.

For 18 flowers, he buys 18 ÷ 3 = 6 bouquets (at the lower price).
He saves 6 bouquets × $0.33 = $2.00.

Ibanga eliyinhloko lithola $100. Ukuba unesivumelwano sesikhathi sesiphelele saka-30%, ibanga elinganiselwa lizoba ngelinye lilinganiselwa ngokusuka kwesivumelwano.

Ibanga elinganiselwa = $100 - (30% of $100)

80	Two women each gathered one-sixth of a gallon [24 L]. Then one boy gathered six gallons [6.5 L]. How many gallons of water were left?	10	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola ukuthola! (I'm happy to help!)

Let's break it down:

Two women each gathered 1/6 of a gallon, which is 24 L. So, together they gathered 2 x 24 L = 48 L.

One boy gathered 6.5 L.

To find out how many gallons of water were left, we need to subtract the total amount gathered from the original amount. Let's assume the original amount was 1 gallon, which is 3.785 L.

So, the amount left is:
3.785 L - 48 L - 6.5 L = -51.715 L

Since we can't have a negative amount of water, it means the total amount gathered exceeded the original amount. Therefore, there's no water left.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Akukho amanzi akhona!"" (There's no water left!)"

Dan has 3 plants, each with 25 roses. So, he has 3 x 25 = 75 roses.

Each rose has 8 thorns, so he has 75 x 8 = 600 thorns.

84	One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win?	15	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Igemu lilodwa liphinde lihle 22. Liphinde lifuna amagemu 8 akudla kuwina. Amagemu angakanani awina?

(Igemu = game, lilodwa = one, liphinde = team, lihle = played, lifuna = won, amagemu = games, akudla = than, kuwina = they lost)

Let's say they lost x games. Then, they won x + 8 games.

We know they played 22 games in total, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost equals 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. And they won 7 + 8 = 15 games!

Amagemu angakanani awina? Awina amagemu angu-15! (How many games did they win? They won 15 games!)"

87	A company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of their initial salary every year for five years. If Sylvie has been with the company for five years as of last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?	9360	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initial salary = $600/month = $7,200/year

Year 1: 10% increase = $7,200 + (10% of $7,200) = $7,920/year
Year 2: 10% increase = $7,920 + (10% of $7,920) = $8,712/year
Year 3: 10% increase = $8,712 + (10% of $8,712) = $9,583.20/year
Year 4: 10% increase = $9,583.20 + (10% of $9,583.20) = $10,541.52/year
Year 5: 10% increase = $10,541.52 + (10% of $10,541.52) = $11,595.67/year

After 5 years, Sylvie's annual salary is $11,595.67.

Now, let's calculate her salary after 3 more years:

Year 6: 10% increase = $11,595.67 + (10% of $11,595.67) = $12,755.24/year
Year 7: 10% increase = $12,755.24 + (10% of $12,755.24) = $14,030.77/year
Year 8: 10% increase = $14,030.77 + (10% of $14,030.77) = $15,433.85/year

After 3 more years, Sylvie's annual salary will be $15,433.85.

Let's break it down, my friend. Let the number of copies sold by the Herald be x. Then, Marilyn's first edition sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, the Herald sold 8,000 copies.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"

Let's break it down:

Cristina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 didn't show up. To find out how many friends showed up, we'll subtract 1/4 from 16.

16 x 1/4 = 4 friends didn't show up
So, 16 - 4 = 12 friends showed up

She needs 75 gift bags for each of the 12 friends who showed up. That's a total of:
12 x 75 = 900 gift bags

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
900 x $2 = $1800

93	Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10 percent. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast could Gerald run? With the improved diet, running the 400-meter hurdles in seconds?	36	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
Gerald was 2 seconds slower, so he ran it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which means he's now 10% faster.
To find 10% of 40, multiply 40 by 0.1, which gives you 4.
So, Gerald is now 4 seconds faster, which means he runs it in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

103	It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles from the coast to the opposite edge of the interior, how many minutes would it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city?	140	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

To find the answer, we need to divide the total distance of the city (42 miles) by the distance covered in 10 minutes (3 miles). This will give us the number of 10-minute intervals needed to cover the entire city.

42 miles ÷ 3 miles = 14 intervals

Since each interval takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 10:

14 intervals × 10 minutes = 140 minutes

So, it would take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

104	Poppy is solving the 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, and then her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces. How many pieces of the jigsaw are left to sit on?	500	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Poppy starts with 1,000 pieces and puts a quarter (1/4) on the board. That's 1,000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces.

She has 1,000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mother puts a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces on the board. That's 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to sit on.

107	On Wednesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour and a half episode. If he watched a total of seven hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Thursdays, he watches an hour and a half episode, which is 90 minutes.

If he watched a total of 7 hours = 7 x 60 = 420 minutes of television,

and 90 minutes on Thursdays, then he watched 420 - 90 = 330 minutes on Wednesdays.

Since each episode on Wednesdays is 30 minutes, he watched 330 ÷ 30 = 11 episodes.

108	Henry is baking cookies for a local baking contest. He wants to double what he baked last year. When the baking is done, he realizes that he has baked 15 more cookies if he wants to. When he puts the 5 cookies in the refrigerator, he throws them away, and now there are 110 cookies in total.	50	"""Sawubona! (Hello!) Let's solve this problem in isiZulu.

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. He wants to double it, so 2x.

He realizes he needs 15 more, so 2x - 15.

After throwing away 5, he has 110 cookies, so the equation is 2x - 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 20 = 110.

Adding 20 to both sides, 2x = 130.

Dividing both sides by 2, x = 65.

So, Henry baked 65 cookies last year."""
109	A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. An appliance company will refund $20 per gallon if you fill up at this station. If a person buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will the gas be after cash rewards?	28	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the cost of gas:

10 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The appliance company will refund $20 per gallon, so:

10 gallons x $20 per gallon = $200.00

You will get a refund of $200.00. To find the cost of gas after cash rewards, subtract the refund from the cost:

$30.00 - $200.00 = -$170.00

You will actually get $170.00 back! (Note: This is because the refund is more than the cost of gas.)

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
110	Marcel and Beatrice are competing to see who can eat the most fruit rolls, so they open as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice has two rolls wide and 24 rolls long, while Marcel has 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long. If they both ate the whole meal, how much did they eat on average?	45	"Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)

Let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls each of them has:

Beatrice has 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so she has 2 x 24 = 48 rolls.

Marcel has 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 rolls.

In total, they have 48 + 42 = 90 rolls.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 ÷ 2 = 45.

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit rolls each.

If Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photos in the zoo?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many photos as Brittany's, so Brittany's phone can hold 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300 photos.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photos, so the number of ducks is 300 ÷ 50 = 6.

116	Katie makes coffee with a ratio of 7:13 teaspoons of sugar to a cup of water. If she consumes a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, imagine how many teaspoons of sugar she consumes.	42	"Ngiyakuthanda! (I love it!)

Let's break it down, my friend. The ratio is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. Since Katie consumes a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, we can set up the equation:

7x = 120

To find the number of cups of water, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 120 ÷ 7
x = 17.14 (let's round it up to 17, since we can't have a fraction of a cup)

Now, since the ratio is 7:13, for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. So, if Katie consumes 17 sets of 7 teaspoons of sugar, she'll consume:

17 × 13 = 221 cups of water

And the number of teaspoons of sugar she consumes is:

17 × 7 = 119 teaspoons of sugar

119	Adrian's total salary is 30% more than his top salary. After four years, his salary has increased, 40% more than four years ago. If both Adrian's and Layla's salaries were increased at the same time, and Adrian had earned $40,000 four years ago, imagine what their salaries would have been four years later.	95200	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step.

Adrian's current salary is 30% more than his top salary. This means his top salary is 100%, and his current salary is 130% of that.

Four years ago, Adrian's salary was $40,000. To find his current salary, we need to increase it by 40%. 

40% of $40,000 is $16,000. Add this to his original salary: $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Now, let's find 30% of $56,000: $56,000 x 0.3 = $16,800. Add this to his salary four years ago: $56,000 + $16,800 = $72,800.

So, Adrian's salary four years later would be $72,800.

To answer in an African language, I'll use Zulu: ""Izindleko zikaAdrian ziyenza kwaba $72,800 eminyakeni emine."" (Adrian's salary would be $72,800 in four years.)

Ukuthola ukuthi umsebenzi wakhe uyahluka ngonyaka, kufanele sithole ukuthi uMiguel usebenzisa izipheki ezili-60 * 4 = izipheki ezili-240 ngonyaka. (Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we find that Miguel uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets per month.)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday, so 4 x 6 = 24 miles.

Total cost: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = $4.00
Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

138	Mark took a 75-question test yesterday. He completed the test in 5 hours. Today, he took another 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he fail?	105	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Yesterday, Mark completed 75 questions in 5 hours. To find his rate, divide 75 by 5: 75 ÷ 5 = 15 questions per hour.

If he had 8 hours, he could have completed: 15 questions/hour × 8 hours = 120 questions.

Since he only completed 75, he would have failed: 120 - 75 = 45 questions.

Today, Mark took 100 questions at the same rate. In 6 hours, he could complete: 15 questions/hour × 6 hours = 90 questions.

Since he took 100 questions, he would have failed: 100 - 90 = 10 questions.

In total, Mark failed: 45 + 10 = 55 questions.

141	There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as there are baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as there are queen bees.	400	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

* Akukho amabele angu-700 ekhaya lemizi. (There are 700 bees in the hive.)
* Amabele asebenzi ayisi-2 kulamabele abasha. (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.)
* Amabele abasha ayisi-2 kulamabele akakho. (There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.)

Let's calculate:

* Amabele akakho = x (queen bees)
* Amabele abasha = 2x (baby bees)
* Amabele asebenzi = 2(2x) = 4x (worker bees)

We know that x + 2x + 4x = 700.

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide by 7: x = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees, 200 baby bees, and 400 worker bees.

154	On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three one-hour classes per day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two two-hour classes per day. There are 16 weeks of classes per semester. How many hours per semester does Kimo spend attending classes?	272	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Kimo has 3 classes/day × 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes/day × 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day. That's 4 hours/day × 2 days/week = 8 hours/week.

In total, Kimo spends 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks of classes per semester, Kimo spends 17 hours/week × 16 weeks = 272 hours per semester attending classes.

155	Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 bagels every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each bagel is two feet long. If Bill were to put all the baked goods end to end, how many shoe lengths would they have?	280	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 300 rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches
* 120 croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches
* 60 bagels x 2 feet = 120 feet = 1440 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Add them up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Now, let's convert inches to shoe lengths. Assuming a standard shoe length is 12 inches, we get:

3360 inches ÷ 12 inches/shoe length = 280 shoe lengths

So, Bill's baked goods would stretch 280 shoe lengths if placed end to end!"

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 2 x 200 = 400 bananas.

Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 2 x 400 = 800 bananas.

Chimpanzees need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 2 x 100 = 200 bananas.

In total, he needs to order 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas for 2 months.

Kelly runs back and forth once and then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back, doing this 34 times.	80	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the distances they covered:

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a total distance of:
15 x 2 (there and back) x 100 yards = 3000 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering a distance of:
1 x 2 x 100 yards = 200 yards

Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering a distance of:
34 x 2 x 40 yards = 2720 yards

Adding the two distances, Kelly covers a total distance of:
200 + 2720 = 2920 yards

So, Blake covers a total distance of 3000 yards, and Kelly covers a total distance of 2920 yards. Therefore, Blake runs the fastest in 15 minutes.

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?	92	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Original price = $20
Increase = 20% every 2 months

After 2 months, price = $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, price = $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months, price = $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months, price = $34.56 + (20% of $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months, price = $41.47 + (20% of $41.47) = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months, price = $49.76 + (20% of $49.76) = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months, price = $59.71 + (20% of $59.71) = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months, price = $71.65 + (20% of $71.65) = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months, price = $85.98 + (20% of $85.98) = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
After 20 months, price = $103.18 + (20% of $103.18) = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months, price = $123.82 + (20% of $123.82) = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months, price = $148.58 + (20% of $148.58) = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months, price = $178.30 + (20% of $178.30) = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months, price = $213.96 + (20% of $213.96) = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months, price = $256.75 + (20% of $256.75) = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
After 32 months, price = $308.10 + (20% of $308.10) = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
After 34 months, price = $369.72 + (20% of $369.72) = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
After 36 months, price = $443.66 + (20% of $443.66) = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

So, after 36 months, a bag of marble will cost approximately $532.39.

Let's calculate: 15 Spanish flannels × 3 eggs each = 45 eggs needed.

Sandra's neighbor gives 9 eggs at a time, so: 45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs per visit = 5 visits.

Sandra needs to wait for her neighbor to watch the child 5 times."
167	Sez is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, their combined age will be 28.	16	"Ndi izina lyine, ndi lingala! (That's okay, I understand!)

Let's break it down:

Let Brooke's current age be x. Since Sez is twice as old as Brooke, Sez's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, their combined age will be 28. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide by 3:

x = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old, and Sez is 16 years old.

Nalingi kobanga! (You're welcome!)"
168	Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel. How much money does Ethel have if Jimmy has $8?	18	"Akwa ukwu! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language!)

Let's solve the problem. If Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, that means Ethel has half of what Jimmy has.

Jimmy has $8, so Ethel has $8 ÷ 2 = $4.

Ukuze ukwazi inani lezicathamo ezihambayo, singathola inani lezicathamo ezinhlangothini zayo. (To find the total number of legs, we need to count the number of legs on each creature.)

Izicathamo ezine-80 nezinhlanga ezinhlanu (80 spiders with 8 legs each) = 80 x 8 = 640 izinhlangothi

Izicathamo ezine-90 nezinhlanga ezintathu (90 insects with 6 legs each) = 90 x 6 = 540 izinhlangothi

172	There are four birds in a caboose. A sallie is three years older than a grany red. A grany red is twice as old as a sallie four. If a sallie four is the same as a sallie thirty-two, and a sallie is thirty-two eight years old, what is the total age of the four birds?	51	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down step by step:

* A sallie four is the same as a sallie thirty-two, so sallie four = 32.
* A grany red is twice as old as a sallie four, so grany red = 2 × 32 = 64.
* A sallie is three years older than a grany red, so sallie = 64 + 3 = 67.
* Since a sallie is thirty-two eight years old, we know that 32 + 8 = 40, but this is not relevant to the problem.
* Now, let's find the total age of the four birds: sallie + grany red + sallie four +? =?
* We don't know the age of the fourth bird, but we can still find the total age: 67 + 64 + 32 +? =?

Let's call the age of the fourth bird ""x"". Then, the total age is: 67 + 64 + 32 + x = 163 + x.

Unfortunately, we can't find the exact total age without knowing the age of the fourth bird. However, we can express the total age as 163 + x.

If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have after all these expenses and help?	350	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break down Zaid's expenses:

1. Rent: 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
3. Charity: Half of $6,000 = $3,000
4. Daughter's expenses: $200

182	Jan is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan by five years. If Jan is 30, how old is Jan?	23	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down, my friend.

If Jan is 30, and two years ago Jan was x, then x = 30 - 2 = 28.

Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jan by five years, so Mark's age two years ago was (x - 5)/2.

Since Mark is two years younger than Jan, Mark's current age is Jan's age - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28.

Now, let's find Mark's age two years ago: Mark's current age - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26.

So, (28 - 5)/2 = 26 - 2, which means 23/2 = 24, and that's correct!

Therefore, Jan is indeed 30 years old."

In Zulu, I'll respond: ""Kubonga ukudla kwesithupha kanye nesithathu.""

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Rolling a number over 3: P(4, 5, or 6) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%

Rolling two consecutive numbers: P(1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 4 and 5, or 5 and 6) = 4/36 = 1/9 ≈ 11.11%

The difference: 50% - 11.11% ≈ 38.89%

So, rolling a number over 3 is approximately 38.89% more than rolling two consecutive numbers.

There are 10 small animal rooms that sit alone and each small animal is given 5 pieces of straw.	5	"Ngiyakuthanda ukuthola imibuzo yakho! (I love getting your questions!)

Let's break it down:

* Russell is distributing straw among the small rats in 3 rooms. Since the rats are in equal groups, let's assume there are x rats in each room. So, there are 3x rats in total.
* Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the rats is 3x × 6 = 18x.
* There are 10 small animal rooms with one animal each, and each gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total straw for the small animals is 10 × 5 = 50.

Let's calculate:

1. First, we need to find John's hourly wage. Let's assume his annual salary is $50,000. Since he works 2000 hours a week, that's 2000 * 52 = 104,000 hours per year. So, his hourly wage is $50,000 / 104,000 = $0.48 per hour.
2. With the 5% salary increase, his new hourly wage is $0.48 * 1.05 = $0.504 per hour.
3. For the year, he worked 104,000 hours, so his total salary is 104,000 * $0.504 = $52,409.60.
4. Add the one-time cash prize of $5000, and John's total earnings for the year are $52,409.60 + $5000 = $57,409.60.

Kusho ukuthola imali yonke emnyakeni! (That's the total amount of money he earned that year!)"
202	Josie grows vines on her ten-hectare plot. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes a year, and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does her farm produce a year?	100	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

1 hectare = 2.471 acres, so 10 hectares = 10 x 2.471 = 24.71 acres

Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, so 24.71 acres produce 24.71 x 5 = 123.55 tons of grapes

Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, so 123.55 tons produce 123.55 x 2 = 247.1 barrels of wine

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question! Josie's farm produces approximately 247 barrels of wine a year."
203	Carl's favorite food is cheese. This week he ate one sandwich every day for lunch and used 2 pieces of cheese on each sandwich. 3 days a week he ate cheese and egg rolls for breakfast and used one larger piece every day than the first. He made macaroni and cheese dishes for him for many dinners for a week and used 8 pieces of cheese in them.	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let me calculate the total number of cheese pieces Carl used this week:

* 7 days of lunch with 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich = 7 x 2 = 14 pieces
* 3 days of breakfast with 3 pieces of cheese per day (2 + 1 larger piece) = 3 x 3 = 9 pieces
* Many dinners with 8 pieces of cheese = 8 pieces

Total number of cheese pieces Carl used this week = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 pieces

205	Brinley is in Mr. Burt's math department. Mr. Burt gives six exams each semester. It allows students to score lower than the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89,71,92,100 and 86 on the first five exams, how many scores are needed on the sixth exam to get an average of 93?	98	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total score Brinley needs to get an average of 93:

Total score needed = Number of exams x Desired average
= 6 x 93
= 558

Brinley's current total score is:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

To find the score needed on the sixth exam:
Score needed on sixth exam = Total score needed - Current total score
= 558 - 438
= 120

So, Brinley needs to score 120 on the sixth exam to get an average of 93.

209	Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates that sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the total purchase cost of each cup	145	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Each plate costs $6,000, so total cost of plates = 6 x $6,000 = $36,000

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates, so:
Twenty dozen cups cost = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Now, let's convert twenty dozen to individual cups: 20 x 12 = 240 cups

Total purchase cost of each cup = $34,800 ÷ 240 cups = $145 per cup

210	Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, the jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, and she's getting $5 for each child she watches. Every time she mows the lawn, her parents pay her $4, and if Sarah saves $10 before she starts babysitting, how long before she buys her jacket and shoes?	10	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Sarah needs $30 for the jacket and 2 x $20 = $40 for the shoes, so she needs $30 + $40 = $70 in total.

She starts with $10 and earns $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting. She also earns $4 from mowing the lawn. Let's calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to reach her target:

$70 - $10 - $20 = $40 remaining
$40 ÷ $4 = 10 times she needs to mow the lawn

So, Sarah needs to mow the lawn 10 times to buy her jacket and shoes.

211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?	4	"Ngiyakwazi! (I understand!)

Let's break it down, my friend!

Let the number of red chickens be x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens!

214	Jerry has two pools, both draining at 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool.	8	"""Odi nke ji, nke a! (That's a tough one, my friend!) 

Let's break it down. Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago. Then, the larger pool had 2x water 4 minutes ago. 

Since both pools drain at 4 gallons per minute, the smaller pool had x - 16 gallons of water now, and the larger pool had 2x - 16 gallons of water now. 

But we know that the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool, so we can set up the equation: 

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) 

Solving for x, we get x = 32. So the smaller pool had 32 gallons of water 4 minutes ago, and the larger pool had 64 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. 

Now, the smaller pool has 32 - 16 = 16 gallons of water, and the larger pool has 64 - 16 = 48 gallons of water. 

So, the answer is: Igwe puta iri na asaa! (The smaller pool has 16 gallons, and the larger pool has 48 gallons!)"""

Let's break it down:

Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back 10% more, which is:
$2000 x 0.10 = $200
Total amount to be paid back = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janet pays $165 per month for 12 months, so she pays a total of:
$165 x 12 = $1980

To find Janet's balance, subtract the total paid from the total amount to be paid back:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janet's balance is $220.

219	In the board game, four students scored a total of 251 points. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri outscored Naomi and Briana by 17 points, while Yuri outscored Jojo by 10 and a half points.	54	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down in isiZulu:

Naomi wayenza 68 amaphoyisi. (Naomi scored 68 points.)

Yuri wayenza 17 amaphoyisi ngapambi kwabaNaomi noBriana. (Yuri outscored Naomi and Briana by 17 points.)

Yuri wayenza 10.5 amaphoyisi ngapambi kwaJojo. (Yuri outscored Jojo by 10.5 points.)

Let's calculate Yuri's points:

Yuri's points = Naomi's points + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85

Since Yuri outscored Jojo by 10.5 points, Jojo's points are:

Jojo's points = Yuri's points - 10.5 = 85 - 10.5 = 74.5

Now, let's find Briana's points:

Briana's points = Yuri's points - 17 = 85 - 17 = 68

Since the total points are 251, we can set up the equation:

68 + 85 + 74.5 + Briana's points = 251

Subtracting the known points from 251, we get:

Briana's points = 251 - 227.5 = 23.5

So, the points are:

Naomi: 68
Yuri: 85
Jojo: 74.5
Briana: 23.5"

226	James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, 40 types of water. If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card (close to the odd number) is the type of water?	33	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Initially, James had:
30 fire + 20 grass + 40 water = 90 cards

He loses 8 water cards, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 water cards left

He buys 14 grass cards, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass cards

Total cards now: 30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water = 96 cards

Probability of choosing a water card: 32/96 ≈ 0.333 (or 33.33%)

So, the percentage chance of randomly choosing a water card is approximately 33%."

She ordered an extra meat for $2.00, an extra cheese for $1.00, an avocado for $1.00, and 2 slices for $0.25 each, but decided to add an extra $3.00 for her meal, which included chips and drinks. She has a $5.00 gift card to use to pay, so how much does she still owe?	9	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost of Chad's meal:

Basic burrito = $6.50
Extra meat = $2.00
Extra cheese = $1.00
Avocado = $1.00

Extra for meal (chips and drinks) = $3.00
Total cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so she can use that to pay part of the meal.

Total cost of cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Tax = 10% of $240,000 = $24,000

Additional cost = 12 x $1000 = $12,000

236	He knew that he could save money by mixing the ink with five blank pens and making a complete pencil. After buying 25 pens, how many pencils would he have left in total if he used them to make a new one?	31	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngizokuqonda ukuthi uma unezindlela zokuthola imali ngokuhlanganisa ink nezipens eziyisithupha, izipens ezinhlanu zizoba ngumcebo omusha. Uma ubuye 25 ezipens, izipens ezizoba ngiziphi zibe ngokufanayo uma sezithathe ukwenza omusha? (I understand that if you have a way to save money by mixing ink with six blank pens, five blank pens will be a new pencil. If you buy 25 pens, how many pencils will you have left in total if you use them to make a new one?)

Ukubonga, uma unezipens ezinhlanu zizoba ngumcebo omusha, ukuthola izipens ezinhlanu kubuye kwi-25 kuyoba ngama-5 amacebo. (Thank you, if five blank pens make a new pencil, getting five pencils from 25 will be 5 pencils.)

238	Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jess, so if Jess is 20, what is the sum of the ages of the three women?	68	"Ndi ewu! (That's ""okay"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

Let's break it down:

Jess is 20 years old.
Mary is 5 years older than Jess, so Mary is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Joan is 2 years older than Mary, so Joan is 25 + 2 = 27 years old.

The sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 27 = 72.

O di nma! (That's ""it's good"" in Igbo!)"
239	The number of students in the school campus was 1000. The campus had 3 entrances A,B and C and was also used for exits, if 30% of the students of the meeting were to exit through Exit A of the building, 3/5 of the rest would exit through Exit B, and the rest would exit through Exit C, guess the number of students who left through Exit C?	280	"Ndi ofuma! (That's ""Let's calculate"" in Igbo, a Nigerian language)

30% of 1000 students exit through Exit A, which is:
1000 x 0.3 = 300 students

That leaves 1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining 700 students exit through Exit B, which is:
700 x (3/5) = 420 students

That leaves 700 - 420 = 280 students

So, 280 students exit through Exit C.

Odi nma! (That's ""It's good"" in Igbo)"
240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?	21	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

John has 54 candies and has twice as many as Robert, so Robert has 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than James: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
241	Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books, including ours, how many books would they end up reading together?	6	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

242	Mike had a pen friend with 5 minutes. He broke his pen friendship with the two. They each send 2 letters a week, each 5 pages long. He politely replies that he can write a page every 6 minutes.	3	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Ngifuna ukuthi ungithole ukuthi Mike ungalahli ithemba lakhe lepen friend ngamaminithi ayisihlanu. Wabulala ithemba lakhe lepen friend nababili. Bafika imiyalezo emibili ngosuku, ngalinye iliphezu eliyi-5. Wahlangana ngokuthula ukuthi angakwazi ukubhala iphezu ngamaminithi ayisix.

(Uh, I want to tell you that Mike had a pen friend for 5 minutes. He broke his pen friendship with the two. They each send 2 letters a week, each 5 pages long. He politely replies that he can write a page every 6 minutes.)

Now, let's calculate how many pages Mike can write in 5 minutes:

Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes, so in 5 minutes, he can write:

1 page / 6 minutes = 0.17 pages per minute
0.17 pages/minute x 5 minutes = 0.85 pages

So, Mike can write approximately 0.85 pages in 5 minutes."
243	Jason has 1000 minutes of phone packs per month, he talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. And this month he spent an additional 300 minutes with another employee.

245	In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?	7	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break this down in isiZulu:

Izicathama ezinhlanu zikwi-puli 1, kunezicathama ezili-4. Izicathama ezinhlanu zikwi-puli 2, kunezicathama ezili-32. Ukudlula kwalezicathama kupuli 1 ne-puli 2, kukuphinda kwaba-2 kwalezinhlanu zikwi-puli 2.

(There are 4 cormorants in pool 1, and 32 cormorants in pool 2. The difference in cormorants between pool 1 and pool 2 is twice the number of fish in the two pools.)

Let's find the difference in cormorants: 32 - 4 = 28

Since the difference is twice the number of fish, we divide by 2: 28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each pool.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
246	Jane's makeup artist charged her $250 per hour. For the film she starred in, she required very expensive makeup and it took her 6 hours to do it every day and 4 times a week. The film took 5 weeks to complete. After the film was made, the makeup artist gave Jane a 10% discount for the work done.	27000	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

Jane's makeup artist charged $250 per hour. For 6 hours a day, that's $250 x 6 = $1500 per day. For 4 days a week, that's $1500 x 4 = $6000 per week. For 5 weeks, that's $6000 x 5 = $30,000.

With a 10% discount, Jane pays $30,000 - (10% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
247	Isabella bought invitations for her younger sister's birthday party. She spent $12 for the cake ingredients. $43 for the birthday gift. $15 for the decorations. $4 for the invitations and $22 for the bags with small gifts for the guests. She divided the cost equally between two of her parents and three of her siblings, each of whom spent how many dollars?	32	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's calculate the total cost: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabella divided the cost equally among 2 parents and 3 siblings, that's 5 people in total.

To find out how much each person spent, divide the total cost by 5: $96 ÷ 5 = $19.20

So each person spent $19.20.

Ngubonga! (Thank you!)"
248	A cook bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions is $1.50. How much did the cook use?	300	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

* 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds = 4 x 50 = 200 pounds
* 1 pound of onions costs $1.50, so 200 pounds will cost = 200 x $1.50 = $300

Kusho ukuthi! (That's it!) The cook used $300."
249	On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister ate. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister ate. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, and the next day 13. How many more calories did Sue eat than her sister, since 1 cookie has 200 calories?	5,600	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

So, Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

Ngiyabonga! (Thank you!)"
