The giant dragon, Perg, sits atop Mount Farbo, spewing fire at anything within 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the golden staff, the only tool known to kill the dragon, from a height of 400 feet, if it is in the dragon's fire ring. But when Polly carries the jewel, she can throw the staff three times farther than if she does not carry the jewel. If she carries the jewel, how far away from the ring must Polly be and how far away from the dragon will the dragon be?

Polly can throw the golden staff from a height of 400 feet if she carries the gem. If she does not carry the gem, she can throw the staff from a height of 1000 feet.<eos>"	1000
