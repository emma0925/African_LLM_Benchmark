Jackie is considering whether to do her own taxes or hire a trained accountant to do it for her. If she does these taxes on her own, she could lose three hours of self-employment, costing her $35 an hour in salary. A professional accountant costs $90.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
It would be more cost-effective for Jackie to hire a trained accountant to do her taxes as it would save her more time and money. The cost of $35 per hour for three hours of self-employment is equal to $105, which is less than the cost of $90 for a professional accountant. Furthermore, a trained accountant can provide additional value-added services such as tax filing and payroll preparation, which would save time and money in the long run.<eos>"	90
