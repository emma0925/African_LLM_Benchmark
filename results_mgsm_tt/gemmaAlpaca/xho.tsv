Marissa takes an hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the 2 miles. If you want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) needed to walk the remaining distance?
<eos>

Marissa's average speed is 4 miles per hour. To find her speed (in miles per hour) for walking the remaining distance, we divide the total time taken to walk the 4 miles (1 hour) and the total time taken to walk the 2 miles (1 hour). Her speed for the remaining distance is therefore 4 miles per hour.<eos>"
