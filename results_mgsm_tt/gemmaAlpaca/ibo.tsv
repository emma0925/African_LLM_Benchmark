Janeth would have to pay a total of $24,400 for the principal and interest for the period of 12 months. This is calculated by taking the principal amount of $2,000 and multiplying it by the interest rate of 10%, which gives an interest amount of $244. This is then added to the principal amount and results in a total amount to be paid of $2,244. This amount is then multiplied by 12 to get the total amount paid over the period of 12 months, which results in $24,400.<eos>"
