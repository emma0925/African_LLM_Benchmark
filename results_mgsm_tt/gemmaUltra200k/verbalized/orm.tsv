Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. $5 for one window, but only 60% off for each second window. Kyler wants to buy 16 windows. How much will they cost?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
According to the given information, Kyler wants to buy 16 windows. The cost of one window is $5, and there is a 60% off sale for each second window. So, the cost of 16 windows would be:

16 windows x $5 (per window) = $80

For the second window, the cost would be:

16 windows x $5 (per window) x 0.6 (sale off) = $5.12

Therefore, the total cost of 16 windows would be:

$80 + $5.12 = $85.12

So, it would cost Kyler $85.12 to buy 16 windows for his new apartment.<eos>"	16

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston and Seattle have in common if Seattle has 20 sheep?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. 

Let's say that Seattle has x sheep. 

According to the first statement, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2x x sheep. 

According to the second statement, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4x x sheep. 

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so we can solve for x: 

4x x = 20 

4x = 5 

x = 5/4 

Therefore, Seattle has 5/4 sheep. 

To find the total number of sheep the three cities have in common, we need to add up the number of sheep each city has: 

Toulouse: 2x (5/4) = 5 sheep 

Charleston: 4x (5/4) = 5 sheep 

Seattle: 5/4 sheep 

Total: 5 + 5 + 5/4 = 15.5 sheep 

So the three cities have 15.5 sheep in common.<eos>"	15

For the first 40 hours of work in a week, Eliza is paid $10 per hour, plus 1.2 times the overtime. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she get for the week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Eliza will be paid $10 per hour for the first 40 hours worked and 1.2 times the overtime. To calculate her total pay for the week, we need to first calculate the amount she will earn for the first 40 hours:

Eliza's pay for first 40 hours = 40 hours x $10 per hour = $400

Now, we need to calculate the amount she will earn for the additional 5 hours of overtime:

Eliza's pay for overtime = 5 hours x 1.2 times the overtime rate = 5 hours x $12 = $60

To find her total pay for the week, we add the two amounts together:

Eliza's total pay for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza will earn $460 for the week.<eos>"	460

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the total outcome of the program in three months, we need to add up the outcomes from each month:

Month 1: 60 outcomes
Month 2: 20 outcomes (60 - 3 * 20)
Month 3: 45 outcomes (20 - 0.7 * 20)

The total outcome in three months is:

60 + 20 + 45 = 125 outcomes.<eos>"	125

Raymond and Samantha have a daughter.Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.Raymond was 23 years old when he had a son.If Samantha is now 31 years old, how long ago was Raymond's son born?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. Since Samantha is 6 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond had his son at age 23, we can assume that Samantha was also born around the same time as Raymond's son. 

Let's say that Raymond's son was born in year X. Then, Samantha was born 6 years before that, which means she was born in year X-6. Raymond was born X+6 years before Samantha, which means he was born in year X-23.

So, if we assume that Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond had his son 23 years before her birth, we can find the year of Samantha's birth by subtracting 23 from 31: 31-23=8. Samantha was born 8 years ago.<eos>"	8

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot confirm if Grech has 110 coins or not. However, if we assume that Grech has 110 coins and the silver coin is 30 times more valuable than the gold coin, then Grech would have:

This means that Grech actually has 2290 coins in total, as he has 3300 coins of silver and -2290 coins of gold (since he has more silver coins than gold coins, the negative number represents the difference).<eos>"	2290

Answer only. 
Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. Each floor consists of 8 units, occupying 3/4 of the building. How many of the total units are unoccupied?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's assume that Richard is the only resident on his floor, and there are no other residents on any other floors. 

Each floor has 8 units, and Richard's floor has 15 stories. So, the total number of units on his floor is 15 x 8 = 120. 

We know that Richard lives in unit 121, which is on the 15th floor. There are 12 units on the 15th floor, so we can subtract 12 from 120 to get 108 units on the 15th floor. 

However, we also know that each floor has 8 units, so we can multiply 8 by 15 to get 120 units on each floor. To find the total number of units in the building, we can add up the units on each floor:

120 (units on the 15th floor) + 120 (units on the 14th floor) + ... + 120 (units on the 2nd floor) + 120 (units on the 1st floor) + 120 (units on the ground floor) = 720 units.

To find the total number of unoccupied units, we can subtract the number of units occupied on the 15th floor from the total number of units in the building:

720 - 120 = 600 units.

Therefore, there are 600 unoccupied units in the building.<eos>"	600

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total weight of the driver and the cargo vehicle, which is 3755 pounds. We want to know how many boxes the cargo vehicle can carry without exceeding the weight limit of 5000 pounds. 

We can do this by subtracting the weight of the cargo vehicle from the weight limit and dividing the result by the weight of each box. 

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds
1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds = 8.3 boxes

Therefore, the cargo vehicle can carry approximately 8 boxes without exceeding the weight limit.<eos>"	8

There are 365 days in a year. In the first 180 days, Cecilia will need to feed 1 litter of cat food per day. In the remainder of the year, she will need to feed 2 litter of cat food per day. To calculate the total amount of cat food Cecilia will need in the first year, we can add the number of days she will need to feed 1 litter (180) and the number of days she will need to feed 2 litter (365-180 = 185). Therefore, Cecilia will need a total of 365 litter of cat food in the first year.<eos>"	365

<|user|>
Answer only. 
The number of donkeys in a neighbourhood is less than the number of dogs and donkeys put together. If there are two dogs for every dog, how many animals are there in the neighbourhood?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
There are only dogs and donkeys in the neighbourhood, so the total number of animals is the same as the number of dogs and donkeys combined. Let's call this number ""x"".

We know that the number of donkeys is less than the number of dogs and donkeys combined, which means that the total number of donkeys is less than ""x"". Let's call this number ""y"".

Since there are two dogs for every dog, we can write that the number of dogs in the neighbourhood is 2 times the number of dogs that are dogs. Let's call this number ""z"".

Now we have the following relationships:

- x = total number of animals in the neighbourhood
- y < x
- z = 2 times the number of dogs in the neighbourhood

To solve for x, we need to add y and z together:

x = y + z

We still need to express y in terms of z, so we can substitute into the first equation:

x = 2z + y

We can now solve for x:

x = 2z + y
x = 2(2z + y)
x = 4z + 2y

So the total number of animals in the neighbourhood is:

x = 4z + 2y

Now we just need to substitute the expression for y into the final equation:

x = 4z + 2(2z + y)
x = 6z + 2y

And there we have it! The total number of animals in the neighbourhood is less than 6z + 2y.<eos>"	2

Answer only. 
Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in espionage. How many girls are not in espionage?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by setting up the equation: 

2/5 of 200 = 2/3 of (total number of girls in espionage) 

200 / 5 = 40 

40 x 2/3 = 26.66... 

Since we can't have fractional girls, we can say that there are 26 girls in espionage. 

Now, we can find the total number of girls in espionage by adding the girls in the equation: 

26.66 + 26 = 52.66 

Therefore, there are 52 girls in espionage.<eos>"	52

If there were initially 30 motorcycles on the motorway, how many vehicles passed through the traffic closure in the first 15 minutes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
We know that in the first 15 minutes, some vehicles passed through the traffic closure and then 20 more vehicles passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. We also know that 5 vehicles took the exit from the line and did not drive through the traffic closure. 

Let's say that there were initially x motorcycles on the motorway. We know that:

x motorcycles - 5 motorcycles = 30 motorcycles

x - 5 = 30

x = 35

So, initially, there were 35 motorcycles on the motorway. 

In the first 15 minutes, some vehicles passed through the traffic closure. Let's say there were y vehicles that passed through. We know that:

y vehicles + 5 vehicles = 35 motorcycles

y = 35 - 5

y = 30

So, there were 30 vehicles that passed through the traffic closure in the first 15 minutes. 

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more vehicles passed through. So in total, we have:

30 vehicles + 20 vehicles = 50 vehicles

Therefore, a total of 50 vehicles passed through the traffic closure in 30 minutes.<eos>"	30

So, to find the total number of 30-minute episodes he watches on Wednesdays, we can subtract the total hours he watches on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from the total hours he watches on Wednesdays:

Total hours on Wednesdays: 2 (for a one-hour program on Wednesday) + 2 (for a few 30-minute episodes) + 0 (for no TV on Tuesdays) = 4 hours

Total hours watched: 7 (on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays) + 4 (on Wednesdays) = 11 hours

To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we can divide the total time watched on Wednesdays by the length of each episode:

Number of 30-minute episodes: 4 / 30 = 0.4

Since we can't have fractional episodes, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Frank watches 1 30-minute episode on Wednesdays.<eos>"	130

Kim started her own cleaning business and calculated how much profit she would make from her customers. She already had 3 customers, but she was talking to 5 other potential customers, feeling confident enough to include them in her calculations. Each household needed 2 sheets of laundry and one pack of clothes to clean. The cost per sheet of laundry was $2, and the cost per pack of clothes was $5. That's the only difference. The average weekly income per household was $92.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
So, to calculate how much profit Kim can make from her cleaning business, she needs to first determine how many times she can clean for each household per week. Let's assume that each household can pay for a cleaning service once every two weeks. 

In this case, Kim's cleaning business can generate the following revenue:

(3 households x $92 per week x 2 weeks) + (5 potential customers x $92 per week x 2 weeks) = $1,696

However, Kim also needs to factor in the cost of the materials and the time it takes to clean each household. 

Let's assume that it takes Kim 2 hours to clean each household, and the cost of the cleaning materials is $50 per week. 

The total cost for each household would be:

($92 per week x 2 weeks) + ($50 per week x 2 weeks) = $774

This means that Kim's cleaning business would have an overall profit of:

$1,696 - $774 = $922

Therefore, Kim can expect to make approximately $922 in profit per week from her cleaning business, assuming all households pay for the same amount of cleaning services and there are no additional expenses.<eos>"	922

If a merchant buys a sack of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and if the merchant sells each sack for $30 and makes a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The merchant bought 6 sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 per sack, for a total cost of $120. Each sack costs $2 to transport, so the total cost to transport all 6 sacks is $12. 

The merchant then sells each sack for $30, and makes a total profit of $400. 

To find how many sacks the merchant sold, we can set up an equation: 

$20 + $2(number of sacks transported) = $30(number of sacks sold) - $400

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

$20 + $2(number of sacks transported) = $260 - $400

This gives us: 

$20 + $2(number of sacks transported) = $140

Solving for the number of sacks transported, we get: 

number of sacks transported = ($140 - $20) / $2 

number of sacks transported = 65

Therefore, the merchant sold 65 sacks of wheat.<eos>"	65

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total amount spent on the show and food:

Total amount spent = $20.25 (tickets) + $4.50 (food) = $24.75

Next, we need to find how much each person spent on the stairs:

Total cost of stairs = $33 (per stair) x 2 (stairs) = $66

Now, we can divide the total amount spent by the total number of people (3) to find the average cost per person:

Average cost per person = $24.75 / 3 = $8.25

So, each person would pay $8.25 if they agreed to share all expenses equally.<eos>"	8

Sarah wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes for herself. The jacket she wants is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20. Sarah takes care of 4 children in the neighborhood, each time she takes care of a child she gets $5. Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass. If Sarah saved $10 before she started taking care of the baby, how many times would she have to cut the grass before she could buy a jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding out how much money Sarah has in total. She saves $10 before taking care of the baby, and she gets $5 for each child she takes care of. Let's assume she takes care of all 4 children. Then, she would earn $20 ($5 x 4) in total. 

Now, we need to figure out how many times she needs to cut the grass to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Let's assume she needs $30 to buy the jacket and $40 to buy the two pairs of shoes. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

$20 + $20 + $30 = $80 (total money Sarah needs to buy the jacket and shoes)

$80 ÷ $5 = 16 (total number of times Sarah needs to cut the grass)

So, Sarah would need to cut the grass 16 times before she could buy the jacket and shoes. 

However, we also know that Sarah's parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass. So, let's assume she cuts the grass 4 times a week. Then, she would earn $16 ($4 x 4) in total from cutting the grass. 

We can subtract this amount from the total amount she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, and see how many times she needs to cut the grass in total. 

$80 - $16 = $64

$64 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Sarah would need to cut the grass 12 times in total to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. 

But, we also know that Sarah saves $10 before taking care of the baby. We can add this amount to her total earnings from cutting the grass, and see if she has enough money to buy the jacket and shoes without having to cut the grass more times. 

$10 + $16 + $20 + $20 = $66

$66 ÷ $5 = 13

So, Sarah would need to cut the grass 13 times in total to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes, taking into account the $10 she saved before taking care of the baby. 

Since Sarah only needs to cut the grass 13 times, she would have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes without having to cut it more times.<eos>"	13

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a matching belt for $32. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can make her purchase?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math! 

First, we need to find out how much money Lori needs to make in total for her shoe and belt purchase. 

$320 for shoes + $32 for belt = $352 

Next, we need to figure out how many hours she needs to work to earn that amount of money. 

Let's assume Lori works for a steady amount of time each week. Let's say she works 20 hours per week. 

We can set up an equation to solve for the total number of hours she needs to work to make enough money for her purchase: 

How many hours (h) does Lori need to work to earn $352? 

We know she makes $8.00 an hour, so we can plug that value into our equation: 

8h = $352 

Solving for h, we get:

<|assistant|>
Mark pays a total of $230,000 for 12 cars: $20,000 for each car and an additional $1,000 tax on each car. However, we need to add the 10% tax on the total price of the cars, which is $23,000. So, the total amount Mark pays is:

$20,000 (cars) + $1,000 (tax) + $2,300 (tax on cars) = $25,300

Therefore, Mark pays $25,300 for 12 cars.<eos>"	12

John orders some pizza to share with his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure that each of them can have 4 slices. Pizza is only sold sliced into 8 pieces. How many pizzas does it take for John to order?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation to solve for the number of pizzas John needs to order:

John wants to order enough pizzas to provide 4 slices to each of his 20 friends, so he needs a total of 4 * 20 = 80 slices of pizza.

But a pizza is only sold in 8 slices, so John needs to round up to the nearest pizza. He can buy 10 pizzas (8 + 2) for a total of 80 slices.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.<eos>"	4

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Jason has a total of 1000 minutes per month, which includes 15 minutes every day with his boss and an additional 300 minutes with other people. 

To calculate how many minutes he has left, we need to first calculate how many minutes he has used so far. 

He has used a total of 15 minutes every day with his boss, which adds up to 450 minutes for the entire month. 

He also has an additional 300 minutes for other people. 

So, the total minutes used so far is 450 + 300 = 750. 

To find out how many minutes he has left, we can subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available. 

1000 - 750 = 250. 

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.<eos>"	250

Jean's make-up artist charges her $250 per hour. If she needs expensive make-up for a film she's in, she needs to work 6 hours a day, 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is made, the make-up artist gives Jean a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she paid for. 

Total number of hours = (Number of days x Number of hours per day) / Number of days Jean was filming
= (5 x 6) / 5
= 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the hourly rate by the total number of hours:

Total cost = Make-up artist's hourly rate x Total number of hours
= $250 x 6
= $1,500

However, we need to subtract the discount of 10% from the total cost:

Adjusted total cost = Total cost - (Total cost x 10%)
= $1,500 - ($1,500 x 10%)
= $1,350

Therefore, Jean paid $1,350 for her make-up.<eos>"	1350

Isabel spent $12 for the cake, $43 for the birthday present, $15 for the flowers, $4 for the invitation, and $22 for a nice bag for the guests. She divided the cost with her two parents into three parts. How much did each person pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's call the amount Isabel paid for the cake ""C"", the amount she paid for the birthday present ""B"", the amount she paid for the flowers ""F"", the amount she paid for the invitation ""I"", and the amount she paid for the bag ""G"". We know that:

C = $12

B = $43

F = $15

I = $4

G = $22

Isabel paid a total of:

C + B + F + I + G = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

To find out how much each person paid, we can assume that the two parents share the cost equally. That means each person pays half the total cost. So, each person pays:

C/2 = $6

B/2 = $21.50

F/2 = $7.50

I/2 = $2

G/2 = $11

Therefore, Isabel's parents each paid $6, $21.50, $7.50, $2, and $11 respectively.<eos>"	11

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sue ate a total of 13 cookies on Tuesday. Each cookie has 200 calories. So, the total calories Sue ate on Tuesday is 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times her sister's cookie, which is the same as eating 4 cookies. Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate a total of 4 * 200 = 800 calories on Monday.

On Wednesday, Sue ate 5 cookies, which is the same as eating 5 times her sister's cookie. Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate a total of 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Wednesday.

To find the total number of calories Sue ate more than her sister, we need to subtract the calories Sue ate on Monday and Wednesday from the calories she ate on Tuesday. 

2600 - 800 - 1000 = 900 calories

Therefore, Sue ate a total of 900 calories more than her sister on Tuesday.<eos>"	900
