Kylar borrowed money to buy months for the new house. One month is worth 5 pf but the second month she doesn't buy when she gets 60% of the stock. Kylar wants to buy 16 months. How much will it cost to buy them?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To buy 16 months, Kylar will need to calculate how much each month is worth. She knows that one month is worth 5 pf, so she needs to multiply that by the number of months she wants to buy. However, she also knows that the second month is worth 60% of the stock, which means she needs to subtract 60% of the stock from the total value of the first month to get the value of each month. 

So, let's say that the total stock is worth 100 pf. 

The first month is worth 5 pf, so the value of 1 month is 5 pf. 

The second month is worth 60% of the stock, which is 60 pf. 

To buy 16 months, Kylar will need to multiply the value of one month by the number of months she wants to buy, but she needs to subtract the value of the second month from the total value of the first month. 

So, Kylar will need to buy 16 x 5 pf = 80 pf. 

However, she only has 72 pf in her account. To buy 16 months, she will need to borrow 80 pf - 72 pf = 8 pf. 

Therefore, it will cost Kylar 8 pf to buy 16 months.<eos>"	16

She tries to get home at 4 hours, but it takes her two hours to get home because of a car accident. Half an hour later, she runs at 30mph and drives at 80mph at 4 hours. What is the distance between her home and home if the 4 hours are right?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The statement ""Answer only"" is not a question, therefore it cannot be answered.

To answer the question posed in the text:

Let's first find the distance Jean traveled during the first 3 hours at a speed of 60mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 60 * 3

Distance = 180 miles

During the next 2 hours (including the car accident), she travels at a lower speed of 30mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 30 * 2

Distance = 60 miles

To find the average speed during the entire journey, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Total distance traveled = 180 + 60

Total distance traveled = 240 miles

Total time = 3 + 2

Total time = 5 hours

Average Speed = 240 / 5

Average Speed = 48mph

The distance between Jean's home and home is 48 miles.<eos>"	48

A new procedure is repeated 60 times in the first month. The number of repetitions in the second month is three times more than in the previous month. Then the calculation is repeated for the remaining 30% in the third month. After all, how many times do we repeat the procedure in three months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to first calculate the total number of repetitions in the first month, which is 60. 

In the second month, the number of repetitions is three times more than in the previous month, so we can calculate the number of repetitions in the second month as follows:

60 x 3 = 180

Therefore, in the second month, there are 180 repetitions. 

In the third month, we only need to calculate the number of repetitions for the remaining 30% of the procedure, which is:

180 x 30/100 = 54

Therefore, in the third month, there are 54 repetitions. 

To calculate the total number of repetitions in three months, we can add up the number of repetitions from each month:

60 + 180 + 54 = 394

Therefore, the total number of repetitions in three months is 394.<eos>"	394

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Carlos will have to wait for approximately 2.33 years for his lemon tree to be able to generate income. This calculation is based on the average annual yield of 90 fruits per year and the life expectancy of the tree being 3 years. By the third year, the tree should have produced enough lemons for harvest to generate income.<eos>"	3

<eos>
<|assistant|>
The profit increase depends on the initial price set by the seller. However, if the seller decides to increase the price of the furniture by 10% and sell it for the new price, their profit increase would be 1.25% (2.5% of $8000).<eos>"	8000

Two buses travel to San Rafael in one hour. We continue to drive to the end of the tunnel and then they both run about 80 miles. The next day, they travel to the end of the tunnel for about 150 miles. What is the distance between the buses that ran those two days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The distance traveled by the buses on the first day is 80 miles (assuming they traveled straight from the start of the tunnel to the end and back). On the second day, they travel a distance of 150 miles (assuming they went straight to the end and back).

To find the total distance traveled by the buses on both days, we can add the distance traveled on the first day (80 miles) to the distance traveled on the second day (150 miles).

Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the buses on both days is 230 miles.<eos>"	230

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day on Sundays, and we sell 4 yogurts for $5. How much would you pay for 30 yogurts?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have the ability to perform arithmetic operations or make financial calculations. however, based on the information provided, it would be possible to calculate the cost of 30 yogurts by multiplying the price per yogurt by the quantity. so, the cost of 30 yogurts would be:

price per yogurt x quantity = total cost
$1.50 x 30 = $45

therefore, the cost of 30 yogurts is $45.<eos>"	45

Richard lives in a house in a 15-story building. There are 8 houses in the building. If we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied by us, how many houses are there that are not occupied by us?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the given information, we can set up a proportion to find the number of houses that are not occupied by us.

Let's assume 'x' is the number of houses that are not occupied by us.

We know that:

3/4 of the building is occupied by us,

So, 3/4 of 8 (total number of houses in the building) = 6 houses.

And, the total number of houses in the building = 8.

Therefore, we can find the number of houses that are not occupied by us by subtracting the number of occupied houses from the total number of houses:

Total number of houses - Number of occupied houses = Number of unoccupied houses

8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 houses that are not occupied by us.<eos>"	2

The day he had more than he used to, how many catamaran spirits did he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information given, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the total number of catamaran spirits Alxamis made:

Let x be the number of small catamaran spirits he made.
Let y be the number of large catamaran spirits he made.

We know that Alxamis made 6 small catamaran spirits, so we have:

6x = 60

Let's solve for x:

x = 10

Alxamis made 10 small catamaran spirits.

Now, let's find the total number of catamaran spirits he made, including both small and large. We can do this by adding the number of small catamaran spirits he made with the number of large catamaran spirits he made:

x + y = 10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, Alxamis made a total of 14 catamaran spirits, including both small and large.<eos>"	14

If in one area, the number of households exceeds the number of households of twelve if you add the number of dogs to the number of cats. if in one area there are two cats and sixty dogs, how many households are there in the area?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The number of households in the area would be twelve (12). This is because:

- The number of dogs is 60, and each dog belongs to one household. Therefore, there are 60 households with one dog each.
- The number of cats is 2, and each cat also belongs to one household. Therefore, there are 2 households with one cat each.
- The total number of households is 62 (60 + 2). However, we know that each dog belongs to one household, so we can subtract 1 from 62 to get the number of households with cats only, which is 61.
- Therefore, the answer is: If there are two cats and sixty dogs in one area, there are 61 households in the area.<eos>"	61

Answer only. 
Of the 200 girls who made CM2, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are scouts. What is the percentage of girls who are not scouts?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's say we have 200 girls in total. 

2/5 of the girls are boys, which means 40 girls are boys (200 x 2/5). 

2/3 of the girls are scouts, which means 133 girls are scouts (200 x 2/3). 

To find the percentage of girls who are not scouts, we can subtract the number of girls who are scouts from the total number of girls and then divide that by the total number of girls, and multiply by 100: 

200 - 133 = 67 

67/200 x 100 = 33.5% 

Therefore, 33.5% of the girls who made CM2 are not scouts.<eos>"	2

one room usually has one white notebook which we distribute to 4 teachers who use this room every day. no one says he teaches 2 classes every Sunday and uses the same white notebook. if we turn the notebook on three times in one class, how many times do we turn the notebook on in one day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming each teacher uses the white notebook equally, and there are four teachers in the African classroom, the initial distribution of the white notebook would be:

- Teacher A: 1 white notebook
- Teacher B: 1 white notebook
- Teacher C: 1 white notebook
- Teacher D: 1 white notebook

If we assume that each teacher uses the white notebook in the same way, and each class requires the use of the white notebook once, then the total number of times the white notebook will be turned on in one day would be:

- Teacher A: 1 white notebook (used in 1 class)
- Teacher B: 1 white notebook (used in 1 class)
- Teacher C: 2 white notebooks (used in 2 classes)
- Teacher D: 1 white notebook (used in 1 class)

So the total number of times the white notebook will be turned on in one day is 4.<eos>"	4

Kim set up a mailroom, and counted the amount of mail she could get from her clients. She had three clients, but, hoping to negotiate with five other clients, she sent her mail. Two bottles of toilet paper and a pack of mail would be able to wash each client's house. She would have to spend $2 for a bottle of toilet paper and $5 for a pack of mail. That's all. I don't know how her weekly income would be $92.

Jean has a pineapple plantation of 10 hectares. If each hectare produces 100 pineapples and Jean harvests them every 3 months, how much can he harvest each year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Jean harvests his pineapples every 3 months for a year, he can produce a total of 400 pineapples (10 hectares x 100 pineapples per hectare = 1000 pineapples per year). However, we need to take into account that there may be some variation in the number of pineapples produced each season depending on weather conditions, pests, and other factors. Therefore, it is possible that Jean may end up with slightly fewer or more pineapples than predicted.<eos>"	1000

If Jackie hires a copywriter and pays them $90 per hour, she will need to pay a total of $35 x 3 (for the 3 jobs) = $105 for the menial jobs.

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He also prunes 2 trees a year. He started with 50 trees. In 10 years, 30% of the trees died. How many trees are left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has planted in 10 years, including the 50 trees he started with. We can do this by adding the number of trees he plants each year:

10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 100 trees

Next, we need to calculate how many trees are left after 10 years, taking into account the 30% that died. We can do this by multiplying the total number of trees by the percentage of trees that survived:

100 * 70/100 = 70 trees

Therefore, there are 70 trees left after 10 years.<eos>"	10

If we distribute 200 kilotons of fuel to 40 regional railway stations. If each station receives 2 kilotons of fuel, how many kilotons of fuel are not used?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If each station receives 2 kilotons of fuel and we distribute 200 kilotons of fuel to 40 regional railway stations, we can calculate the total amount of fuel received by the stations as follows:

Total fuel received = 2 kilotons/station x 40 stations = 800 kilotons

However, we only distributed 200 kilotons of fuel. Therefore, the total amount of fuel not used is:

Total fuel not used = Total fuel distributed - Total fuel received = 200 kilotons - 800 kilotons = -600 kilotons

This means that 600 kilotons of fuel were not used by the 40 regional railway stations.<eos>"	40

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Janet has 22 white bikes, 10 black bikes, 6 red bike bags, and 2 red bike bags. 

To find out how many bikes she has now, we can use the information given to us. 

Firstly, we know that Janet had 22 white bikes and 10 black bikes. So, the total number of bikes she had initially was 22 + 10 = 32. 

Now, we need to add the number of bikes she bought from the buyer to this total. 6 red bike bags and 2 red bike bags each had 6 bikes, so the total number of bikes she bought was 6 + 6 = 12. 

Finally, we can add the total number of bikes Janet had before buying any bags to the total number of bikes she currently has to find out how many bikes she has now. This gives us 32 + 12 = 44. 

Therefore, Janet currently has 44 bikes.<eos>"	44

Answer: $165 x 12 = $2,100 (total amount owed), but since she promised to pay back 10% of what she owed, she would only need to pay $210. Therefore, the amount she would have left over would be $165 - $210 = $45.<eos>"	45

Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, who is about half the age of Zack. What are the ages of these three and these three, given that Harriet is 21 years old?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as a language model AI, I cannot provide actual ages to solve the problem. However, here is the breakdown of the problem and the possible solutions.

Given:
- Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, who is about half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old.

Let's assume that Adrian's age is A and Harriet's age is B. 

From the first statement, we can write:

A = 3B

From the second statement, we can write:

B = 21

Substituting B in the first statement, we get:

A = 3(21) = 63

Therefore, Adrian is 63 years old and Harriet is 21 years old. 

To find the age of Zack, we can use the fact that:

Zack's age = (Harriet's age + 10) * 2

Substitute B = 21 in this equation, we get:

Zack's age = (21 + 10) * 2

Zack's age = 54

Therefore, the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack are 63 years old, 21 years old, and 54 years old respectively.<eos>"	54

Answer only. 
Jean buys pizzas to share with her friends. She has 20 friends, and Jean wants one of them to have four portions. If the pizzas are equally divided into 8 portions, how many pizzas should Jean buy?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that each pizza has 8 portions, and Jean wants one of her friends to have four portions, she should buy a total of 5 pizzas. 

20 friends x 4 portions per friend = 80 portions 
8 portions per pizza = 80 portions / 8 = 10 pizzas 
1 pizza has 8 portions 
5 pizzas x 10 portions each = 50 portions 
4 portions per friend = 20 portions 
5 friends x 4 portions each = 20 portions 
Total portions = 50 + 20 = 70 
Total pizzas = 70 / 8 = 8 (rounded up) 

Therefore, Jean should buy 8 pizzas to share with her friends.<eos>"	8
