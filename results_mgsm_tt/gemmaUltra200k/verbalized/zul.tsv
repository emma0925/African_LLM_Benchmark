6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"<|system|>
You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of sheep each city has:

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so we can write:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston

Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so we can write:

Charleston = 4 * Seattle

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the first equation:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
4 * Seattle = Charleston
2 * Charleston = 4 * Seattle

Solving for Charleston, we get:

Charleston = 2 * (4 * Seattle) / 2
Charleston = 8 * Seattle / 2

Now, we can substitute this expression for Charleston into the second equation:

4 * Seattle = 8 * Seattle / 2

Solving for Seattle, we get:

Seattle = 8 / 6

So, the three cities have a total of:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * (8 * Seattle / 2) = 16 * Seattle / 2
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 8 / 6 = 32 / 3
Seattle = 20

Therefore, they have a total of:

16 * Seattle / 2 + 32 / 3 + 20 = 64 / 3 + 20 + 20

= 104 / 3

So, they have a total of 104 / 3 sheep.<eos>"	3

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to calculate the average number of downloads per month. 

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 60 x 3 = 180 downloads
Third month: 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads

So the total number of downloads for three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366. 

Therefore, the average number of downloads per month is: 366 / 3 = 122. 

The number of downloads in this edition, say a total of three months, is approximately 122 downloads per month.<eos>"	122

Carlos has planted a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 a plant. Each year it will produce 7 oranges that can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

Let's say x is the number of years it takes for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree. 

First, we need to find out how much money Carlos will make from selling his oranges. 

Number of oranges produced per year = 7 * x 

Total revenue from selling oranges = 7 * x * $1.5 

Next, we need to factor in the cost of the tree and the cost of maintaining it each year. 

Total cost = $90 + $3 * x 

In order for Carlos to start making money, the revenue from selling his oranges must equal the total cost of the tree and the cost of maintaining it. 

7 * x * $1.5 = $90 + $3 * x 

Simplifying the equation, we get 10.5x + $90 = $3x 

Subtracting $3x from both sides, we get 7.5x + $90 = $90 

Solving for x, we get x = $10 

Therefore, it will take Carlos 10 years to start making money from his lemon tree.<eos>"	10

Answer only. 
Marissa walks 12 miles. It took her one hour to walk 4 miles, another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed (in miles per hour) she needs to travel the remaining distance?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Marissa wants to find her average speed for the entire distance she walked, which is 12 miles. She knows that it took her 1 hour to walk 4 miles, and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. Let's say she walked x miles in the third hour. 

To find her average speed, she can divide the total distance by the total time. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time 

First, she needs to find the total time she spent walking. 

Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour + x hours 

Now, she can plug in the values she knows to solve for x: 

4 miles / (1 hour + 1 hour + x hours) = 4 miles per hour 

Simplifying the equation, she gets: 

4 miles per hour * (2 hours + x hours) = 4 miles per hour * 2 hours 

Expanding the right side of the equation, she gets: 

4 miles per hour * (2 hours + x hours) = 8 miles per hour 

Solving for x, she gets: 

x hours = 8 miles per hour / 4 miles per hour 

x hours = 2 hours 

So Marissa walked a total of 4 miles in the third hour, and her average speed for the entire distance was 4.5 miles per hour.<eos>"	4

Answer only. 
Cynthia eats ice cream every night. She buys 15 packs of ice cream at $4.00 each. After 60 days, how much will she have spent on ice cream?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Cynthia will have spent on ice cream after 60 days, we need to first find out how much she spends per day on ice cream. We can do this by dividing the total amount she spends on ice cream ($4,800.00) by the number of days she buys ice cream ($60). This gives us the average amount she spends per day:

$4,800.00 / 60 = $80.00

Now that we know how much Cynthia spends per day, we can use this information to find out how much she will spend after 60 days:

(60 days x $80.00) + $240.00 = $4,880.00

So Cynthia will have spent $4,880.00 on ice cream after 60 days.<eos>"	60

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes he gets 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he gets 25% more points. How many points did he get in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
First, we need to calculate the total time Mike played ping pong:

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes

We know that Mike got 4 points in the first 20 minutes, so we can write:

4 points = 20 minutes

To solve for the variable (total points), we need to use the second 20-minute interval:

25% more points = 20 minutes

We can simplify this to:

0.25 points/minute = 20 minutes

Now we can add the two equations together:

4 points + 0.25 points/minute x 20 minutes = 20 minutes

Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. 4 yogurts are currently on sale for $5.00. How much do you spend on yogurt in 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Terry eats 2 yogurts each day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days would be 60 (2 yogurts per day x 30 days). 

The cost of 60 yogurts at $0.17 per yogurt (assuming each yogurt costs $0.17) would be $9.00. 

Therefore, Terry would spend $9.00 on yogurt in 30 days.<eos>"	30

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Charlie sells 20 candles, the total revenue he will receive is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00. 

The cost of the honey cake and string for 20 candles is 10 x $10 = $100. 

Therefore, the direct profit for Charlie is $40.00 - $100 = -$60.00. This means that he will lose $60.00 for making and selling 20 honey cake candles.<eos>"	20

Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. Each floor has 8 apartments and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many empty apartments are there in the building?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate the total number of apartments on each floor by multiplying the number of floors by the number of apartments on each floor:

Total apartments = 15 x 8 = 120

Next, we can calculate the number of apartments that are not occupied by multiplying the total number of apartments by the percentage of the building that is occupied:

Occupied apartments = 120 x 3/4 = 90

To find the number of empty apartments, we can subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:

Empty apartments = 120 - 90 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 empty apartments in the building.<eos>"	30

Tom's boat can go 10 miles an hour. He'll leave at 1 to 4 p.m. He can go back at 6 mph. How long will it take him to get back?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's say Tom's boat travels at 10 miles per hour for the first part of the trip and then at 6 miles per hour for the second part of the trip. 

To find how long it will take him to get back, we can set up an equation: 

10 miles per hour * x hours = 6 miles per hour * (x - 1) hours 

(where x is the total time in hours he will need to travel to complete the trip). 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = (6 miles * (x - 1)) / 10 miles 

x = (6 * (x - 1)) / 10 

10 * x - 6 = 6 * (x - 1) 

10 * x - 6 = 6 * x - 6 

10 * x - 6 = -6 

10 * x = 12 

x = 12 / 10 

x = 1.2 hours 

Therefore, it will take Tom 1.2 hours to get back.<eos>"	1

A wooden bridge can carry more than 5,000 pounds. A truck carrying a load of identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the trailer and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes of maximum value can be loaded onto the truck before it exceeds the weight limit of the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first find the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry on its own:
The weight of the empty truck is 3,755 pounds, and each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry on its own is:
(3,755 pounds) / (15 pounds per box) = 253.6 boxes

Since the truck can only carry 5,000 pounds and the weight of the empty truck is 3,755 pounds, the maximum weight the truck can carry is 1,245 pounds.

Now, let's find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit:
If each box weighs 15 pounds, then the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:
(1,245 pounds) / (15 pounds per box) = 83 boxes

Therefore, the maximum value of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck before it exceeds the weight limit of the bridge is 83 boxes.<eos>"	83

A bucket of 25 oranges, of which 1 is bad, 20% is unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information given, let's first find the total number of oranges in the bucket:

Number of total oranges = 25

Now, we know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so we can subtract 20% of 25 to get the number of unripe oranges:

Number of unripe oranges = 25 * 20% = 5

We also know that 2% of the oranges are sour, so we can subtract 2% of 25 to get the number of sour oranges:

Number of sour oranges = 25 * 2% = 1

Finally, we are left with the number of good oranges:

Number of good oranges = 25 - (5 + 1) = 19

Therefore, there are 19 good oranges in the bucket.<eos>"	19

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate the average number of pages Solo reads per day. 

Total pages read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 + 15 = 46 

Average pages per day = 46/4 = 11.5 

Now, let's say Solo has 4 more days to finish all the reading. He needs to read a total of 15 pages per day to finish all the reading. 

Number of pages to be read per day = 15/4 = 3.75 

Since Solo cannot read fractional pages, he will need to read 3 pages per day on average over the next 4 days to finish all the reading.<eos>"	4

- Thursday: 1 hour episode (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute movie (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hour-long episodes (120 minutes)

Total time: 7 hours

To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation:

30 minutes/episode = 7 hours/4 episodes

Solving for episodes, we get:

episodes = 7 hours / 30 minutes/episode

episodes = 2.33

Since he can't watch fractional episodes, we can round down to 2 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 2 episodes on Wednesday, for a total of 60 minutes.<eos>"	60

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I apologize, as an AI language model, I cannot see the number of ducks in Jamal's duck photo. However, based on the information given, we can find the maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can store. 

The maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can store is 50 more than the number of birds in Jamal's duck photos. Let's say x is the number of ducks in Jamal's duck photos. Then, we can express this relationship as:

x + 50 = 500
x = 500 - 50
x = 450

Therefore, there are 450 ducks in Jamal's duck photos.<eos>"	450

The next day more containers were brought in, and the total number of cars at the port was 30. Count the number of outgoing containers on the second day, assuming that each container had 5 cars.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
First, we need to find out how many total containers were brought into the port on the second day. We know that there were 30 cars, and each container had 5 cars, so we can divide 30 by 5 to get the number of containers: 30 / 5 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 containers brought into the port on the second day. Now we need to find out how many cars were in the six containers. We know that each container had 5 cars, so we can multiply the number of containers by the number of cars in each container: 6 x 5 = 30.

Therefore, there were 30 cars in the six containers brought into the port on the second day.<eos>"	30

Brittany and her mother went to the museum. Admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mother paid for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she gets $8 change, how much money, in dollars, does she pay the dealer?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The admission fee for adults is $12 and for children it is $10. Brittany's mother paid for one child ticket and one adult ticket. She was given $8 change. Therefore, she paid:

1 child ticket = $10
1 adult ticket = $12
Total paid = $10 + $12 = $22

Since she was given $8 change, she pays:

$22 - $8 = $14

Therefore, Brittany's mother pays $14 in total to buy the tickets.<eos>"	14

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy does. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many Facebook friends does James have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x number of friends, James would have 4x that number of friends. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, we can find the number of friends Dorothy has as follows:

12 / 3 = 4, so Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Now, we can find the number of Facebook friends James has:

James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so the number of Facebook friends James has is:

4 x 4 = 16, so James has 16 Facebook friends.<eos>"	16

The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding out how many sacks of wheat the merchant bought from the farmer. We can do this by subtracting the cost of transportation ($2 per sack) from the total profit made by the merchant ($400). 

So, the merchant made a profit of $400 - $200 = $200. 

Since the merchant sold each sack of wheat for $30, let's find out how many sacks of wheat he sold by dividing the total profit by the selling price per sack: 

$200 / $30 = 6.67

Since the answer is not an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get: 

6 sacks 

So, the merchant sold 6 sacks of wheat for a total profit of $200.<eos>"	200

Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 round-trip tickets. They also spent less than $4.50 on food and tickets. They also traveled to two different places that cost $33 each. If they agreed to split the price equally, how much did each person pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by setting up the equation:

3 friends: $20.25 (total for three round-trip tickets)
Less than $4.50 (total spent on food and tickets)
Two different places (each costs $33)

Total cost for all: $20.25 (tickets) + less than $4.50 (food and tickets) + 2($33) = $90.75
Total number of tickets: 6 (3 friends, 3 round-trip tickets)

To find out how much each person paid, we can set up two more equations:

1. Let's say each person paid the same amount for the tickets. Then the total cost would be $90.75 / 3 = $30.25 per person.

2. Alternatively, we can assume that two of the friends paid the full cost of the tickets ($33 each) and the third friend paid nothing. Then the total cost would be $20.25 + $33 + $33 = $96.50. In this case, each person would have paid $30.25 + $33 + $0 = $63.

Since there are only two possibilities for how the friends split the cost, and they are both greater than the actual cost of the tickets, we can assume that they split the cost equally. Therefore, each person paid $30.25.<eos>"	30

Assuming Tom plants 10 trees a year and cuts down 2 trees a year, and he starts with 50 trees, here is the calculation:

After 2 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 44 trees.

After 3 years:

After 4 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 38 trees.

After 5 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 34 trees.

After 6 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 30 trees.

After 7 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 26 trees.

After 8 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 22 trees.

After 9 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 18 trees.

After 10 years: 
Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, leaving him with 14 trees.

Then, 30% of the trees die, leaving him with 10 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom would have 10 trees left.<eos>"	10

On Monday morning, the neighbors decided to keep the pink flamingos and only took one from the collection. They then placed it in front of Sue's door with a note that read, ""We're sorry for taking one of your flamingos, but it was the best one."" 

Sue was furious and decided to file a complaint with the neighborhood association. The association took immediate action and issued a warning to the neighbors, stating that they must return the remaining flamingos and pay a fine of $500. 

The neighbors finally returned the remaining flamingos on Tuesday morning and paid the fine. They were warned to not engage in such behavior again, or they would face serious consequences. 

Sue was relieved to finally have her flamingos back but was still upset about the whole ordeal. She decided to put the pink flamingos in her yard, so the neighborhood would have something to look at and enjoy. The flamingos became a popular attraction, and the neighbors all agreed that they were a great addition to the neighborhood. 

The incident brought some laughter and joy to the neighborhood and became a lesson to teach others to respect each other's property.<eos>"	500

Answer only. 
200 pounds of carrots will be distributed to 40 restaurants in one city. Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of carrots. How many kilograms of carrots will not be used?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
As 200 pounds of carrots are distributed among 40 restaurants, and each restaurant receives 2 kilograms of carrots, we can calculate the total number of kilograms of carrots that were distributed as follows:

Total number of kilograms = 200 pounds / 2 (since 1 pound = 0.453592 kg) = 95.3185 kg

Therefore, the total number of kilograms of carrots that were not used is:

Total number of kilograms - Total number of kilograms of carrots distributed = 95.3185 kg - 95 = 0.3185 kg

So, 0.3185 kg of carrots were not used.<eos>"	0

Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and the shoes each $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, gets paid $5 for each time she hides them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can buy a jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

Let's say Sarah wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. She already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting. 

First, we need to figure out how much money Sarah will have after babysitting once. Let's assume she gets paid $5 for each time she hides the neighbor's kids. 

After one babysitting session, Sarah would have $5 in earnings. 

If she wants to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes, she needs to save up $30 + $20 + $20 = $70. 

So, how many times does she need to babysit to earn $70? 

There are different ways to approach this problem, but let's use algebra. 

Let's say she needs to babysit x times to earn $70. 

We can set up an equation: 

5x = $70 

This means that Sarah needs to babysit for 5 times to earn $70. 

Therefore, Sarah needs to babysit for 5 times before she can buy the jacket and shoes. 

Alternatively, we could have used a proportion to solve this problem. We know that Sarah earns $5 for each babysitting session, so we can set up a proportion: 

5 times $5 = $20 

1 times $5 = $5 

So, in order to earn $20 (the cost of one jacket and two pairs of shoes), Sarah needs to babysit for 1 times $5 = $5. 

Therefore, Sarah needs to babysit for 1 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.<eos>"	1

Gary likes to walk along the edge of the local park, a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks 3 miles an hour, how many hours does he spend walking?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Answer: 

1.5 miles per hour is the speed at which Gary walks. 

3 miles per hour is the same as 3/1.5 miles per hour, or 2 miles per hour. 

So, if Gary walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour, it would take him a certain amount of time to walk the 1.5 miles by 6 miles rectangle. 

Let's set up an equation to find the time it would take Gary to walk the entire distance: 

Time = Distance / Speed 

Time = (1.5 miles x 6 miles) / 2 miles per hour 

Time = 9 hours 

Therefore, it would take Gary 9 hours to walk the entire rectangle if he walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour.<eos>"	2

Number of pizzas = 20 * 4 

Number of pizzas = 80 

Therefore, John needs to buy 80 pizzas for his friends.<eos>"	80

Mary is two years younger than Joan, and five years younger than Jessa. If Jessa is 20, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that Mary and Joan are alive and their ages are not provided, we cannot determine the exact sum of their ages. However, we can use algebra to find the possible sum of their ages based on the information given:

Let's assume that Mary is x years old. Then, we know that:

- Mary is two years younger than Joan, which means Joan is x + 2 years old.
- Jessa is five years younger than Mary, which means Jessa is x - 5 years old.

If Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute this into the equation:

x - 5 = 20
x = 25

Therefore, Mary is 25 years old, and Joan is 27 years old. To find the sum of their ages, we can substitute these values into the equation:

x + (x + 2) + (x - 5) = 25 + 27 + 20 = 72

So, the sum of their ages is 72 years old.<eos>"	72

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation:

12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = Total cost

Since we know the total cost was $120, we can plug in the given numbers and solve for each person's cost:

12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 120
43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 80
15 + 4 + 22 = 41
4 + 22 = 26
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 79
79 = Total cost

Therefore, Isabelle spent:

- $12 on cake ingredients
- $43 on birthday gifts
- $15 on decorations
- $4 on invitations
- $22 on baby gifts

And her parents spent:

- $12 on cake ingredients
- $26 on birthday gifts

Sue ate a total of 10 cakes on Monday and 26 cakes on Tuesday. Her sister ate a total of 5 cakes on Monday and 13 cakes on Tuesday. The total number of cakes eaten by both sisters is 51 cakes. 

Assuming each cake has 200 calories, then the total number of calories consumed by both sisters is:

51 cakes x 200 calories/cake = 10,200 calories

Therefore, Sue and her sister ate a total of 10,200 calories worth of cakes over the two days.<eos>"	10200
