Kyler goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kyler wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should he pay for them?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The cost of 16 glasses would be: 

(16 glasses x $5/glass) + (16 glasses x 60% of $5/glass) = $80 + $64 = $144 

Therefore, Kyler should pay $144 for 16 glasses.<eos>"	16

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle. How many bars do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined, if Seattle has 20 bars?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to first find the number of bars that Charleston and Toulouse have combined. 

According to the statement, Charleston has 4 times as many bars as Seattle, so we can assume that Charleston has 40 bars (4 x 20 = 40). 

We also know that Toulouse has twice as many bars as Charleston, so we can assume that Toulouse has 80 bars (2 x 40 = 80). 

To find the total number of bars, we simply add up the number of bars for each city: 

40 (Charleston) + 80 (Toulouse) + 20 (Seattle) = 140 bars. 

Therefore, the combined number of bars in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 140 bars.<eos>"	140

Answer only. 
For the first 40 hours of work each week, Eliza's salary is $10 an hour. In addition, she receives 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for overtime work. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked 45 hours this week. To calculate her earnings, we need to first find her regular hourly rate for the week. Since she worked more than 40 hours, we can use the formula:

Regular hourly rate = (Total hourly rate - Overtime hourly rate) / Number of hours worked

Plugging in the values, we get:

Regular hourly rate = ($10 x 1.2) / 1 = $12

So Eliza's regular hourly rate for this week is $12. Now, we can calculate her total earnings for the week by multiplying her regular hourly rate by the number of hours worked:

Total earnings = Regular hourly rate x Number of hours worked

Total earnings = $12 x 45

Total earnings = $540

Therefore, Eliza earned $540 for the week.<eos>"	540

Carlos is planting a lemon tree. It costs $90 to plant it. Each year he grows seven lemon trees, each of which sells for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The total revenue generated from Carlos' lemon trees over 5 years is:

First year: 7 lemon trees x $1.5 per lemon tree = $10.5
Second year: 14 lemon trees x $1.5 per lemon tree = $21
Third year: 21 lemon trees x $1.5 per lemon tree = $31.5
Fourth year: 28 lemon trees x $1.5 per lemon tree = $42
Fifth year: 35 lemon trees x $1.5 per lemon tree = $52.5

Total revenue: $10.5 + $21 + $31.5 + $42 + $52.5 = $150

However, we also need to factor in the cost of planting each lemon tree. Over 5 years, this would be $360 ($90 x 5). 

Total revenue after factoring in the cost of planting: $150 - $360 = -$110

This means that Carlos would actually lose money over the 5 year period, as the cost of planting and watering the lemon trees outweighs the revenue generated from selling them.<eos>"	5

Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently, 4 yogurts sell for $5. How much money does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Terry eats 2 servings of yogurt per day, the total number of servings he eats in 30 days would be (2 servings per day) x (30 days) = 60 servings. 

Each serving of yogurt sells for $0.80 (assuming 4 yogurts sell for $5), so the total cost of yogurt for Terry in 30 days would be 60 servings x $0.80 per serving = $48. 

Therefore, Terry would spend $48 on yogurt in 30 days.<eos>"	30

Dana can run four times as fast as she walks, but she can jump half as fast as she runs. She can leap three miles an hour. If she runs a third of the time and walks two thirds of the time, how many miles can she cover in six hours?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that Dana walks at a consistent speed throughout the six hours, we can first calculate her average speed while running:

Average running speed = Total distance / Total time
Average running speed = 3 miles / 4 hours
Average running speed = 0.75 miles per hour

Now, we can use this information to calculate how far she walks during the six-hour period:

Total distance = Average speed x Time
Total distance = 0.75 miles per hour x 6 hours
Total distance = 4.5 miles

Therefore, Dana can cover a distance of 4.5 miles in six hours, assuming she walks at a consistent speed throughout the entire period.<eos>"	4

43	According to the nutrition guide, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag has 5 portions, how many grams could you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you already eat 1,800 calories?	48	"<|system|>

Answer only. 
According to the nutrition guide, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag has 5 portions, how many grams could you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you already eat 1,800 calories?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to use proportion and unit conversion.

First, we need to find the number of calories per gram of chips, which is the same as finding the number of chips per 100 grams. Let's call this value ""x"". 

According to the nutrition guide, one bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, which means that 250/1 (bag) = 250 calories/1 bag. 

Next, we need to find how many grams of chips are in one serving, since we know the number of portions in the bag. We can set up a proportion:

250 calories/1 bag = x calories/1 gram

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

250 * 1 bag = 1 gram * x calories

250 = x calories

So one bag of chips has 250 calories, which means that the number of grams in one serving is 250/x.

Now we can use this information to calculate how many chips you could eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you already eat 1,800 calories:

1,800 calories * 1 bag/250 calories = 7.2 bags

Since you can only eat one bag at a time, you could eat 7 bags of chips per day, or 14 bags per day if you want to meet your daily calorie target. 

However, it's important to note that eating chips alone is unlikely to meet your daily calorie needs, and you should also be eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein.<eos>"	14

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 spiral candles. A pound of beeswax and wikis costs $10.00 in supply. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that the cost of making each candle is not included in the supply cost, and that the only cost involved is the beeswax and wicks, the net profit would be:

Profit = (Selling price - Supply cost) * Number of candles sold
Profit = ($2.00 - $10.00/10) * 20
Profit = -$1.00/5 * 20
Profit = -$20.00

Therefore, Charlie would make a net profit of $20.00 if he sells 20 beeswax candles at a price of $2.00 each.<eos>"	2

A basket contains 25 oranges, of which 1 is rotten, 20% are unripe, 2 are vinegar and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information given, we can calculate the total number of oranges in the basket and then subtract the number of rotten, unripe, and vinegar oranges to find the number of good oranges.

Here's the calculation:

Total oranges = 25
Rotten oranges = 1
Unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 5
Vinegar oranges = 2

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Rotten oranges + Unripe oranges + Vinegar oranges)
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Good oranges = 18

Therefore, there are 18 good oranges in the basket.<eos>"	18

Dan 3 plants rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there in all?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Dan 3 plants rose bushes, each with 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns. We can first calculate how many thorns are on each bush by multiplying the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

25 x 8 = 100

So each bush has 100 thorns. But we only need to know how many thorns there are in total, so we can add up the thorns from all three bushes:

3 x 100 = 300

Therefore, there are 300 thorns in total.<eos>"	300

One soccer team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The soccer team won 8 more games than they lost, and they played 22 games. Let's say they lost x games. Then they won 8 more games than they lost, which means they won 8 - x games. In total, they played 22 games, which means:

8 - x + x = 22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16 - x = 22

Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get:

-x = 6

So, the soccer team won 6 more games than they lost.<eos>"	6

The Herald sold 10 times as many copies as the first edition of Marilyn, so if Marilyn sold 100,000 copies in total, the Herald would have sold 100,000 copies as well. Therefore, the total number of copies sold by both editions combined would be 200,000 copies.

Cristina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each of the invited guests, because 1/4 of the participants didn't show up. She invited 16 friends. The gift bags are $2 each.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to first calculate how many guests are attending the party. We know that Cristina needs 75 gift bags for each of the guests, but 1/4 of the participants didn't show up, so we need to subtract 1/4 of 16 (which is 4) from 16 to get 12 guests who will be attending the party.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags by multiplying the number of gift bags (75) by the price per gift bag ($2). This gives us 150 gift bags, which will be purchased for the party.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Cristina needs to purchase 150 gift bags for the party.<eos>"	150

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Out of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first set up the equation: 

2/5 of 200 = 40 (boys) 

Since we want to know how many girls there are in total, we can set up the equation: 

2/3 of x = 40 

Where x is the total number of girls: 

x = 40 * 3/2 

x = 60 

So there are 60 girls in Girl Scouts and 40 boys. 

To find out how many girls are not in Girl Scouts, we can subtract the total number of girls from the total number of students: 

200 - 60 = 140 

There are 140 students in the school, and 60 of them are girls in Girl Scouts. 

So, there are 80 girls who are not in Girl Scouts.<eos>"	80

Some of the cars pass in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, and then 20 more cars pass in the remaining 15 minutes. Cars from Line 5 take the exit so as not to get into the traffic jam. If there were 30 cars on the main road at first, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cars would have been in the traffic jam if all 30 cars had passed through it. We can do this by subtracting the number of cars that exited the traffic jam from the total number of cars on the main road, which gives us:

30 - 3 = 27 cars

Now, we need to find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We can do this by multiplying the total number of cars that would have been in the traffic jam by the fraction of time that has elapsed:

27 cars * 15/60 = 4.5 cars

Since we can't have fractional cars, we can say that 4 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Finally, we need to find out how many cars were in the traffic jam after the 15 minutes were up. We can do this by adding the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes to the number of cars remaining on the main road after the first 15 minutes:

4 cars + 23 cars = 27 cars

Therefore, there were 27 cars in the traffic jam after the first 15 minutes.<eos>"	15

Assuming each teacher uses the whiteboard for the same amount of time each day, and each lesson lasts the same amount of time, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the answer is:

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

<|assistant|>
To find the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can set up an equation. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday. So, we can write:

2nd Monday = 6 x 4 = 24 miles 

On Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles. 

We can write:

Wednesday = 41 - (24 + 4) = 17 miles 

Therefore, Walt walked 17 miles on Wednesday.<eos>"	17

Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his customers. He already has 3 customers, but he is talking to 5 other customers and feels confident to include them in the calculation. Each customer needs 2 bottles of whiskey and a pack of cloths to clean the house.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
As a language model AI, I cannot provide opinions or advice, but I can help you with the calculations. 

Assuming that each customer pays a fee of $100 for the service, and each bottle of whiskey costs $50, and a pack of cleaning cloths cost $20, the potential total revenue per customer would be $170 ($100 for the service, $50 for a bottle of whiskey, and $20 for the cleaning cloths). 

If Kim has 3 customers, his potential revenue would be $510 ($170 per customer, multiplied by 3 customers). 

If he can include 5 other customers, his potential revenue would be $850 ($170 per customer, multiplied by 5 customers). 

Therefore, the increase in potential revenue by including the additional 5 customers would be $340 ($850 - $510). 

It's important to note that this calculation is only an estimate and may not reflect the actual revenue Kim will make, as there may be additional expenses or factors affecting the revenue.<eos>"	510

Based on the information provided, we can calculate the total number of bees in the hive by adding the number of bees leaving and returning after 6 hours:

Number of bees leaving the hive = 30
Number of bees returning to the hive = (1/2) * Number of bees leaving the hive = 15
Total number of bees in the hive = Number of bees leaving the hive + Number of bees returning to the hive = 30 + 15 = 45

Therefore, there are 45 bees in the hive.<eos>"	45

As they start their race, Steve takes an early lead, but Tim is not far behind. As they approach a hill, Steve's bike hits a bump and he loses control, causing him to fall off his bike. Tim quickly rushes over to help him up, but Steve is already too far behind to catch up.

Tim rides on, eager to see how far he can go before Steve catches up. As he nears his house, he looks back to see Steve in the distance, heading his way. Tim accelerates, trying to leave him behind, but Steve is too determined to let him go.

In the end, both boys make it home safely, but Steve arrives first, having taken the scenic route through the woods. Tim is a little disappointed that he didn't win the race, but he's happy that Steve is okay. They both laugh and joke about who's the better cyclist, agreeing to race each other again sometime in the future.<eos>"	3

Dave ate a large potato pie and savored every bite. However, before he could finish the whole pie, he was interrupted by a hungry sabisa bird. The bird ate an impressive 14 potato pies before snatching the package from Dave's hand. Dave was quick to react and chased the bird away. But not before he devoured half of the remaining potato pie. As he turned to leave, he was confronted by three pigeons that had just arrived on the scene. Each of the pigeons proceeded to eat three potato pies before flying off into the distance. As Dave watched them disappear into the horizon, he couldn't help but feel both satisfied and amazed by the events that had just occurred.<eos>"	14

A merchant bought some bags from a farmer for $20 a bag. If each bag cost $2 to transport from the field to the warehouse, and the merchant sold all the bags for $30 each and made a total profit of $400, how many bags did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding out how many bags the merchant bought from the farmer. 

Since the merchant paid $20 per bag, and each bag cost $2 to transport, the total cost of the bags would be:

20 bags x $2 per bag + $20 total transport cost = $40

Now, let's figure out how many bags the merchant was able to sell for a profit of $400. 

Since the merchant made a total profit of $400, and each bag was sold for $30, the total revenue would be:

(Number of bags sold) x $30 = $400

Solving for the number of bags sold, we get:

Number of bags sold = $400 / $30 = 13.33

Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get:

Number of bags sold = 14

Therefore, the merchant sold 14 bags for a total profit of $400.<eos>"	400

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

Total cost for 3 tickets and food: $28.75
Total cost for 2 separate cars: $66
Total cost for all expenses: $95

If they want to split the expenses equally, each person would pay:

Total cost divided by number of people: $95 / 4 = $23.75

So each person would pay $23.75 to split the expenses equally.<eos>"	23

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month; in the third month, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the first and second months. How many Pokémon cards does she now have in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to use the information given to find the total number of Pokémon cards the person now has. 

In the first month, she collected an unknown number of cards, let's call it ""x"". 

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so the number of cards she collected in the second month is ""x - 20"". 

In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the first and second months, so the number of cards she collected in the third month is ""2x"". 

To find the total number of Pokémon cards she now has, we need to add the number of cards she collected in each month: 

Total number of cards = x + (x - 20) + 2x 

Simplify this expression: 

Total number of cards = 3x - 20 

Now, we need to find the value of ""x"" to get the total number of cards she has. 

Since the total number of cards is 40, we can substitute the expression above into the equation: 

40 = 3x - 20 

Add 20 to both sides: 

60 = 3x 

Divide both sides by 3: 

x = 20 

So the person now has a total of 20 Pokémon cards.<eos>"	20

Sarah needs to save $10 before she can buy her jacket and shoes. 

Let's set up an equation to find out how many times she needs to babysit to reach that goal: 

(Money needed for jacket and shoes) / (Money earned from babysitting) = Number of babysitting sessions 

$30 + $20 - $10 = $40 

$40 / $5 = 8 

Sarah needs to babysit 8 times to save enough money for her jacket and shoes. 

After she finishes babysitting, she can use the money she earned to buy her desired items.<eos>"	8

Let's do the math! 

First, we need to find out how much money Lori will need to buy the shoes and belts: 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belts) = $352.00 

Now, we know that Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour. Let's find out how many hours she needs to work to make the purchase: 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours 

So Lori will need to work for approximately 44 hours to make her purchase.<eos>"	44

adrian is three times older than harriet, and harriet is half as old as zack. if harriet is now 21 years old, calculate the average age of the three in three years.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot do calculations. However, based on the given information, we can find the age of Adrian and Zack separately and then calculate the average age of the three.

Let's assume Adrian is 3 times older than Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack.

Adrian's age = A
Harriet's age = H
Zack's age = Z

Given:

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, which means:

A = 3H

Harriet is half as old as Zack, which means:

H = Z/2

Substituting the values in the first equation, we get:

3H = Z

Now, we can solve for H:

H = Z/3

Substituting this in the second equation, we get:

A = 3(Z/3)

A = Z/3

So, the age of Adrian is the same as the age of Zack, and they are both Z years old. Finally, the average age of the three is:

(Z + Z + Z)/3

= 3Z/3

= Z

So, the average age of the three is the same as the age of Adrian, which is Z years old.<eos>"	3

She ordered an extra meat for $2.00, an extra cheese for $1.00, an avocado for $1.00, and 2 slices for $0.25 each, but decided to add an extra $3.00 for her meal, which included chips and drinks. She has a $5.00 gift card to use to pay, so how much does she still owe?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The total cost of Chad's meal, including the extra items and the $3.00 for the meal deal, is $16.75. However, she has a $5.00 gift card to use, so her total out-of-pocket cost would be $11.75. Therefore, Chad still owes $11.75 for her meal.<eos>"	11

Kalinda is working on a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. How many hours does it take them to complete this puzzle?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating how many minutes it would take for Kalinda to complete the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so let's say it takes her x minutes to complete the 360-piece puzzle. 

x = (360 pieces) / (4 pieces per minute) = 90 minutes 

Now, we need to calculate how much time it would take for Kalinda's mother to complete the same puzzle. Since her mother can put half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, we can assume that it would take her x/2 pieces per minute to complete the puzzle. 

Let's say it takes Kalinda's mother y minutes to complete the puzzle. 

y = (360 pieces) / (x/2 pieces per minute) = 180 minutes 

Now, we need to add the time it would take for both Kalinda and her mother to complete the puzzle. 

Total time = 90 minutes + 180 minutes = 270 minutes 

So it would take them 270 minutes, or 4.5 hours, to complete the puzzle together.<eos>"	4

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math! 

If there are 20 friends, and each pizza can be shared among 4 people, then John needs to order:

20 / 4 = 5

So John needs to order 5 pizzas to make sure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 pieces.

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as a language model AI, I cannot guess the number of students who would exit through Exit C. However, based on the information given, we can find the total number of students who would exit through Exit B and C by calculating 3/5 of the remaining students after exiting through Exit A and subtracting it from the total number of students in the campus, which is 1000.

So, 1000 - (1000 x 30/100) = 700 students. 

Then, we can find the number of students who would exit through Exit C by subtracting the number of students who would exit through Exit B from the total number of students who exited through A and B, which is 700. 

Therefore, the number of students who would exit through Exit C is 700 - (1000 x 30/100) = 460 students.<eos>"	460

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Jason has 1000 minutes of phone packs per month. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, so he uses 15 minutes from his phone pack every day. This means that in 30 days, he would have used up 450 minutes (15 minutes per day x 30 days). 

However, he also spent an additional 300 minutes with another employee. This means that he has used up a total of 450 + 300 = 750 minutes from his phone pack. 

Therefore, he would have 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left for the month.<eos>"	250

In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
There is not enough information to determine the number of fish in each pool. The information given only tells us that there are different numbers of cormorants in each pool and that the difference in their numbers is related to the number of fish. However, we can find the maximum number of fish if both pools had the same number of fish. Let's assume that each pool has a certain number of fish (x). Then:

- In the first pool, there are 4 cormorants, and each cormorant eats a certain number of fish (let's call it y). So, each cormorant eats y fish, and the total number of fish eaten is 4y.
- In the second pool, there are 32 cormorants, each of which eats a certain number of fish. Let's call this number z. Then, each cormorant eats z fish, and the total number of fish eaten is 32z.
- The difference in the number of fish eaten is twice the number of fish in the two pools. This means that:

2(4y) = 32z

4y = 16z

y = 4z

- Therefore, each cormorant in the second pool eats four times as many fish as each cormorant in the first pool.
- If both pools had the same number of fish, the total number of fish would be 4y + 32z = 4(4z) + 32(4z) = 160z.
- Since each cormorant in the second pool eats four times as many fish as each cormorant in the first pool, the number of fish eaten by 32 cormorants is 32(4z) = 128z.
- Therefore, if both pools had the same number of fish, each pool would have 128z fish.<eos>"	128

She divided the cost equally between two of her parents and three of her siblings, each of whom spent how many dollars?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

Total cost of the party: $120

Total cost spent by Isabella: $120

Since Isabella divided the cost equally between two parents and three siblings, we can divide the total cost by 6 (2 parents and 3 siblings) to find out how much each person spent:

$120 / 6 = $20

So each person spent $20.

Therefore, Isabella's parents each spent $20, and each of her siblings spent $20 as well.<eos>"	20
