Janet's duck lays 16 eggs a day. She eats three at breakfast every morning and bakes her duck friends four eggs a day. She sells the rest at the farmers' market every day for $2 per duck egg. How much money does she make in dollars a day at the farmers' market?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Janet earns $2 per day for each duck egg sold at the farmers' market. We can calculate how much money she earns in a day based on the number of eggs she sells and the price per egg:

16 eggs per day x $2 per egg = $32 per day

So, Janet earns $32 per day from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market.<eos>"	32

2	Josha decides to try to buy the house and sell it at a profit. He buys the house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?	70000	"<|system|>

Josha decides to try to buy the house and sell it at a profit. He buys the house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the profit made by Josha, we need to first find out the selling price of the house. 150% of $80,000 is $120,000. However, since Josha only spent $50,000 on renovations, he would need to add that amount to the value of the house to find the total cost of purchase. This would bring the total cost to $130,000. Therefore, the profit made by Josha would be the difference between the selling price and the total cost of purchase, which is $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000. This means that Josha actually lost money on the purchase and renovation of the house.<eos>"	10000

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have combined if Seattle has 20 sheep?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. 

If Seattle has 20 sheep, we can find the total number of sheep by using the information we have:

Toulouse = 2 x Charleston
Toulouse + Charleston = 2 x 4 x Seattle
2 x Charleston + 4 x Seattle = 2 x 4 x 20
8 x 20 = 160
So, Toulouse and Charleston have 160 sheep combined.<eos>"	160

Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives 1.2 times her regular hourly overtime pay. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her weekly earnings?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate Eliza's weekly earnings, we need to first calculate her regular hourly earnings for the 40 hours worked. This is simply $10 x 40 = $400.

Next, we need to calculate her overtime earnings. She works 45 hours, which is 5 hours more than her regular hours. For the first 40 hours worked, she earns $10 per hour, so we can calculate her overtime earnings by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of overtime hours worked: $10 x 5 = $50.

To get her total weekly earnings, we add her regular hourly earnings and her overtime earnings: $400 + $50 = $450.

Therefore, Eliza's weekly earnings for working 45 hours with a 1.2 times overtime pay rate are $450.<eos>"	450

<|assistant|>
The app was downloaded a total of 120 times in the first three months. In the first month, it was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, it was downloaded 3 times the number of times in the first month, which is 180 times. However, in the third month, it was downloaded 30% less than in the second month, which is 120 times. Therefore, the app was downloaded a total of 120 + 180 + 120 = 420 times in the first three months.<eos>"	420

12	Carlos plants a lemon tree. It will cost $90 to plant it. Each year it will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of watering and feeding the tree each year is $3. How many years will it take before he starts to make a profit from the lemon?	13	"<|system|>

Carlos plants a lemon tree. It will cost $90 to plant it. Each year it will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of watering and feeding the tree each year is $3. How many years will it take before he starts to make a profit from the lemon?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate how much money Carlos will make from selling his lemons in one year:

Number of lemons sold per year = 7
Selling price per lemon = $1.5
Total revenue per year = 7 x $1.5 = $10.50

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree for one year:

Planting cost = $90
Annual cost = $3
Total cost for one year = $93

To break even, Carlos needs to earn $93 in revenue from selling his lemons. Once he reaches this goal, he will start to make a profit.

Let's assume Carlos plants the lemon tree in year 1. In year 2, he will have 8 lemons to sell (since the tree produces 1 extra lemon per year), which will generate a revenue of $12.30. In year 3, he will have 9 lemons to sell, which will generate a revenue of $14.55. And so on.

Using this logic, we can find that it will take Carlos exactly 3 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.<eos>"	3

Answer only. 
Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
We need to calculate how many years ago Samantha's age would be when her cousin Raymond was born. Since Samantha is now 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can subtract 31 - 25 = 6 years. Therefore, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha's age would be 31 - 6 = 25 years old. 

Now, we need to find how many years ago was Raymond's son born. Let's say that Raymond's son was born x years ago. We know that Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, which means that Raymond's son was born 23 years after Raymond was born. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

23 + x = 31 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 31 - 23 

x = 8 

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago.<eos>"	8

According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300 - gram bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you have already eaten 1,800 calories?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of grams of chips that you can eat per serving, based on the nutritional information given. We know that one serving of chips has 250 calories, so we can assume that one serving has approximately 25 grams of chips (since the nutritional information usually lists calorie and macronutrient information per 100 grams).

Now, we can calculate how many servings of chips you can eat to reach your daily calorie target of 2,000 calories, while still staying within your already consumed 1,800 calories. We can set up the following equation:

1,800 calories = 25 grams of chips * num servings

This equation tells us that the number of servings of chips you can eat is directly proportional to the number of calories you have consumed. To find the number of servings, we need to divide the total calories consumed by the number of calories per serving:

num servings = 1,800 calories / 250 calories per serving = 7.2 servings

Since you cannot eat a fraction of a serving, we can round up to 8 servings of chips.

Therefore, if you have already consumed 1,800 calories, you can eat approximately 8 servings of chips (or 200 grams of chips) per day to stay within your daily calorie target of 2,000 calories.<eos>"	2000

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the extra income earned by the mechanic on the day he earned the most, we need to find out how much he earned on Thursday and Friday separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic earned: 6 x $60 = $360

On Friday, the mechanic earned: 12 x $40 = $480

The extra income earned on Friday is simply the difference between Thursday and Friday's earnings: $480 - $360 = $120

Therefore, the mechanic earned an extra $120 on the day he earned the most.<eos>"	120

The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:

Total weight of the boxes = 15 pounds per box * number of boxes

The maximum weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. We need to add the weight of the driver and the empty truck to the weight of the boxes to get the total weight that can be loaded onto the truck:

Total weight of the boxes = 15 pounds per box * number of boxes
3,755 pounds = 15 pounds per box * number of boxes + 3,755 pounds
3,755 pounds = 15 pounds per box * number of boxes + 3,755 pounds
15 pounds per box * number of boxes = 3,755 pounds - 3,755 pounds
15 pounds per box * number of boxes = 0 pounds
Number of boxes = 0 / 15 pounds per box
Number of boxes = 0

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 0 boxes.<eos>"	0

A basket contains 25 oranges, of which 1 is rotten, 20% is unripe, 2 are leavened and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of good oranges, we can start by calculating the percentage of oranges that are good. We know that the rest of the oranges are good, so we can subtract the percentage of unripe oranges and rotten oranges from 100% to get the percentage of good oranges.

100% - 20% - 2% = 78%

Now we can multiply the total number of oranges by the percentage of good oranges to get the answer:

25 x 78% = 19.5

Since we cannot have fractional oranges, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get:

19 oranges are good.<eos>"	19

How many miles can Sophia drive on one tank of gasoline?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sophia, according to your car's manual, your tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. You have already driven 100 miles on one tank, which means that you have used up 8.33 gallons of gasoline (100 miles / 12 miles per gallon = 8.33 gallons). 

To figure out how many more miles you can drive on the remaining 3.67 gallons of gasoline, you need to calculate the number of miles per gallon of your car. Let's assume, for the sake of the calculation, that your car's average miles per gallon is 15 (a common estimate for many cars). 

Now, we can use the formula: 

Distance = (Fuel Economy) x (Fuel Consumption) 

where Fuel Economy is the number of miles per gallon, and Fuel Consumption is the amount of fuel used in gallons. 

Plugging in the numbers, we get: 

Distance = 15 x 3.67 

Distance = 55.55 miles 

So, Sophia, you can drive approximately 55.55 miles on one tank of gasoline, assuming a 15 miles per gallon average.<eos>"	15

Answer only. 
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David does, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do with Sarah washing 400 pounds of laundry.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's assume that Sarah does 600 pounds of laundry (400 pounds * 4 times). 

To find the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to find out how much laundry they each do on average. Let's say that Raymond does 300 pounds of laundry per day (assuming he does laundry every day). 

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, we can multiply his daily amount by 2 to get the total amount he does in a day: 300 * 2 = 600 pounds. 

To find the difference in the amount of laundry they do, we simply subtract David's average amount from Sarah's average amount: 600 - 150 = 450 pounds. 

Therefore, the total amount of laundry that Raymond and David do in a day is 600 + 450 = 1050 pounds, and the difference in the amount of laundry they do is 450 pounds.<eos>"	450

The company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the original salary each year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie turned 5 years old in the company last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service to the company?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Answer: 

Let's first find out how much Sylvie's original salary was. We can assume that her salary was the same as the average salary of $600. So, her original salary was $600. 

Now, we need to calculate her new salary after 10% increase for five years of service. 

We can use the formula: 

New salary = Original salary * (1 + 0.10)^5 

New salary = $600 * (1 + 0.10)^5 

New salary = $600 * 1.0505 

New salary = $645.30 

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service to the company would be $645.30.<eos>"	645

Emily has 4 children known as Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Ami is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year younger, how old is Jackson?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so if Amy is x years old, Jackson is x - 5 years old.
- Corey is 1 year younger than Jackson, so if Jackson is y years old, Corey is y - 1 years old.
- James is 10 years old, so we can assume that Amy is at least 10 years old (otherwise the math wouldn't work).
- We still need to find the value of y to solve for Jackson's age.

We can start with the equation:

- y - 5 = y - 1
- 5 - 1 = 4
- 4 = 4

This means that Amy is 4 years old, which means that Jackson is 4 - 5 = -1 years old.

But wait, that doesn't make sense! Corey is supposed to be 1 year younger than Jackson, but we just found out that Jackson is 1 year older than Corey. This must be an error in the question.

If we assume that Amy is 8 years old (just picking a number), then Corey is 7 years old, and Jackson is 7 - 1 = 6 years old.

So, Emily has 4 children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Ami is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year younger, then Jackson is 6 years old.<eos>"	6

<eos>
<|assistant|>
We know that Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald in running the 400-meter hurdles. Let's say Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. This means that the time difference between Lee and Gerald is two seconds. 

To find the time that Gerald will run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we can add 10 percent to the time difference between Lee and Gerald. 

First, we convert the time difference of two seconds to milliseconds: 2000 milliseconds. Then, we add 10 percent of 2000 milliseconds to this value: 

2000 milliseconds + (10 percent of 2000 milliseconds) = 2200 milliseconds 

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 2200 milliseconds, or two and a half seconds.<eos>"	2200

Frankie watches TV after his overtime every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite movie every night. On Wednesday, he watched a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his overtime early and watched a 1-hour and 30-minute episode. On Friday, he stayed up for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of television in total, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to add up the total number of minutes he watched on Monday and Tuesday (1 hour x 2 = 2 hours) and then subtract the total number of minutes he watched on Wednesday (30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes). This will give us the total number of minutes he watched on Monday and Tuesday, which is 2 hours. 

Next, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Thursday. We can do this by subtracting the total number of minutes he watched on Wednesday (60 minutes) from the total number of minutes he watched on Thursday (1 hour x 1 = 60 minutes). This gives us the total number of minutes he watched on Thursday, which is 60 minutes. 

Finally, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Friday by subtracting the total number of minutes he watched on Saturday (2 hours x 1 = 2 hours) from the total number of minutes he watched on Friday (1 hour x 2 = 60 minutes). This gives us the total number of minutes he watched on Friday, which is 60 minutes. 

To answer the question, we can add up the total number of minutes Frankie watched on Monday and Tuesday (2 hours), Wednesday (60 minutes), Thursday (60 minutes), and Friday (60 minutes) to get the total number of minutes he watched, which is 7 hours. Therefore, the answer is that Frankie watched 60 minutes, or 5 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.<eos>"	530

Julia's boat began to leak while she was on the lake. The boat was taking in two liters of water for every ten feet she pulled back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in by the time Julia reached the shore?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The boat had taken in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet pulled back to shore, so the total amount of water taken in would be 2 liters for the distance of 20 feet (10 feet on each side). It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so in total she spent 16 seconds rowing 20 feet. 

To find the amount of water she would have to pump out to reach the shore, we can set up an equation:

2 liters of water per 10 feet = 2 liters of water per distance

2 liters of water per distance = 2 liters of water per 10 seconds

So, if we assume that Julia was rowing at a consistent speed, she would have pumped out 2 liters of water in 16 seconds (the distance traveled is 20 feet and the speed is constant, so the amount of water pumped out is proportional to the distance traveled). 

Therefore, the boat had taken in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet pulled back to shore, and Julia had to pump out a total of 2 liters of water to reach the shore.<eos>"	2

A classroom has a whiteboard shared among 4 teachers who use the classroom in shifts. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is erased 3 times per lesson, how many times per day is the whiteboard erased?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming each teacher has an equal amount of time to use the whiteboard during their lessons, and each lesson lasts for 1 hour, the total time each teacher spends using the whiteboard is 2 hours per day (2 lessons x 1 hour each). 

If the whiteboard is erased 3 times per lesson, then the total number of times the whiteboard is erased per day is: 

(3 erases per lesson) x (4 teachers per classroom) = 12 erases per day 

Therefore, the whiteboard is erased 12 times per day in the classroom.<eos>"	12

If the price of a marble bag is $20 and that price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, what will the price of the marble bag be after 36 months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot predict the future or perform complex mathematical calculations. However, I can provide you with a basic guideline on how to solve this problem. 

Let's say the initial price of a marble bag is $20. 

After 2 months, the price will increase by 20% of $20, which is $4. 

After the next 2 months, the price will increase by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. 

After another 2 months, the price will increase by 20% of $28.80, which is $5.36. 

After 36 months, the price will increase by 20% of the current price, which is $5.36, to get the final price. 

Therefore, the final price of the marble bag after 36 months would be: $5.36 x 1.2 = $6.43.<eos>"	6

Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay off each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300 a month, her credit cards have a minimum payment of $200 a month, and her mortgage has a minimum payment of $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay off in a year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each account:

For student loans: 
50% of $300 is $150. 
So Jessica would pay $150 + $300 = $450 in a month.

For credit cards:
50% of $200 is $100. 
So Jessica would pay $100 + $200 = $300 in a month.

For mortgage:
50% of $500 is $250. 
So Jessica would pay $250 + $500 = $750 in a month.

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice. Each gallon they make costs them $3 of lemon and $2 of sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and a gallon carries 20 glasses. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by setting up the equation:

(20 glasses) * ($0.50 per glass) - ($2 per gallon of lemon juice) = $25 (profit)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 dollars - $2 per gallon = $25 (profit)

Therefore, the amount spent on the lemon is:

$25 (profit) + $2 per gallon = $27 (total spent)

So Juan and Carlos spent $27 on the lemon to make a profit of $25.<eos>"	25

<eos>
<|assistant|>
As a language model AI, I cannot determine the actual votes the candidates received since there is no indication of the number of votes each one got. However, we can determine the maximum number of votes each candidate can receive if they got all the votes and there were 80 students voting.

If each candidate received all of the 80 votes, they would each have 80 votes. But since there are only two candidates, one will inevitably have less votes than the other.

Let's say Candidate A received 60 votes and Candidate B received 20 votes. Then, Candidate A would have 60 votes and Candidate B would have 20 votes.

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is 20 votes.<eos>"	20

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation:

20 bags x $2 transportation cost per bag = $40 total cost of transportation
($30 profit per bag + $40 total cost of transportation) / $20 bag cost = total number of bags sold

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$60 total profit + $40 transportation cost = $100 total cost of selling bags
$100 total cost / $20 bag cost = 5 bags sold

Therefore, the seller sold 5 bags of wheat flour.<eos>"	5

Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 show tickets. They also bought food, and the ticket price was $4.50 higher than the food. They also went on 2 separate trips for $33 each. If they agreed to split all the expenses equally, how much did each of them pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total amount spent on the show tickets and food:

Total amount spent = $20.25 (show tickets) + $4.50 (food) = $24.75

The friends spent $33 each on two separate trips, so the total amount spent on the trips is:

Total amount spent on trips = $33 + $33 = $66

Now, we need to find how much each friend spent on the show tickets and food:

Friend 1's share of the show ticket cost = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75

Friend 1's share of the food cost = $4.50 / 3 = $1.50

Friend 2's share of the show ticket cost = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75

Friend 2's share of the food cost = $4.50 / 3 = $1.50

Friend 3's share of the show ticket cost = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75

Friend 3's share of the food cost = $4.50 / 3 = $1.50

Finally, we need to split the remaining cost of the trip equally among the three friends:

Remaining cost of the trip = $66 - ($24.75 + $24.75) = $16.15

Total cost per friend = $16.15 / 3 = $5.35

So each friend paid:

- $6.75 for their share of the show ticket cost
- $1.50 for their share of the food cost
- $5.35 for their share of the remaining cost of the trip

Therefore, each friend paid a total of $15.60.<eos>"	15

Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he also cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's use the formula: 

Final number of trees = Initial number of trees x (1 - Death rate/100)^Number of years

Where Death rate is the percentage of trees that die per year.

First, we need to convert 30% to a decimal: 

Death rate = 30/100 = 0.3

Now, let's plug in the values:

Final number of trees = 50 x (1 - 0.3/100)^10

Final number of trees = 50 x (0.7)

Final number of trees = 35

Tom has 35 trees left after 10 years.<eos>"	10

to achieve an average score of 93, brinley would need to score 96 points in the sixth exercise. the average of the first five scores is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 86.52, so to increase the average by 3.52 (93 - 89.98), brinley would need to score 96.52 points in the sixth exercise.<eos>"	96

Answer only. 
Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20. Sara checks on her neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she checks on them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had a $10 savings before she started checking on the neighbor's kids, how many times will she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

Let's say Sara has to save $50 in total to buy the jacket and shoes. 

She already has $10 saved up, so she needs to save an additional $40. 

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide $40 by $4 (the amount she earns from mowing the lawn). 

$40 divided by $4 is 10, so Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. 

However, we also know that Sara earns $5 each time she checks on the neighbor's kids. Let's say she checks on them twice. Then, she would earn $10 in total from checking on them, which is not enough to cover the $50 she needs to save. 

So, we can adjust the equation to include the fact that Sara earns money from checking on the neighbor's kids. 

We can rewrite the equation as follows: 

$40 = $4 * number of times to mow the lawn + $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids 

When we solve for number of times to mow the lawn, we get: 

number of times to mow the lawn = ($40 - $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids) / $4 

Now, we need to figure out how many times Sara needs to check on the neighbor's kids to reach the total amount she needs to save. 

Let's start by finding out how many times she needs to check on them to earn $20. 

$20 / $5 = 4, so she needs to check on them 4 times to earn $20. 

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we wrote earlier: 

$40 = $4 * number of times to mow the lawn + $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids 

$40 = $4 * (8 - $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids) / $4 

$40 * $4 = $160 - $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids 

$160 = $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids + $40 

$160 - $40 = $5 * number of times to check on the neighbor's kids 

$120 / $5 = 24, so Sara needs to check on the neighbor's kids 24 times to reach the total amount she needs to save. 

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times and check on the neighbor's kids 24 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.<eos>"	24

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a matching belt for $32. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work before she can make the purchase?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math! 

First, we need to find out how much money Lori will need to buy the shoes and belt. We'll start by finding the total cost of both items: 

$320 (shoes) + $32 (belt) = $352 

Now, we need to figure out how many hours Lori will have to work to earn $352. 

We can set up an equation: 

$8 (per hour) x x (hours) = $352 

Now, we need to solve for x: 

x = $352 / $8 

x = 44 hours 

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt that she wants.<eos>"	44

Jessa is 20 years old. 

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. 

To find the total age of these three girls, we need to add the age of Joan and Mary separately to the age of Jessa. 

The age of Joan is: Jessa's age + 5 (years older) = 20 + 5 = 25 

The age of Mary is: Joan's age - 2 (years younger) = 25 - 2 = 23
