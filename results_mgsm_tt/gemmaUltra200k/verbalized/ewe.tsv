Answer only. 
Marie sent a chicken for $12; 5 milk cartons for $3 each; 4 slices sold for $1.5 each; and some pizza boxes. Marie paid $50 in total. If the pizza boxes cost $8.50, how many pizzas did Marie send?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation: 

Marie's total payment = Cost of chicken + Cost of 5 milk cartons + Cost of 4 slices of pizza + Cost of some pizza boxes 

$50 = $12 + $3(5) + $1.5(4) + $8.50 

$50 = $12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50 

$50 = $31.50 

This means that Marie paid $31.50 for all of her purchases. 

To find out how much Marie spent on pizza boxes, we can subtract the total cost of all the other purchases from her total payment: 

$50 - ($12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50) = $17.50 

Therefore, Marie spent $17.50 on pizza boxes.<eos>"	17

The zebra can run 4 times faster than it walks, and its running speed is 3 km/hour. If it spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, let's calculate the distance it covers in an hour:

- Running: 3 km/hour * 1/3 of the time = 1 km/hour
- Walking: 3 km/hour * 2/3 of the time = 2 km/hour

So the total distance covered in an hour is: 1 km/hour + 2 km/hour = 3 km/hour.<eos>"	3

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Charlie wants to sell 20 cotton balls and each ball should sell for $2.00, he can calculate the total expected revenue by multiplying the number of cotton balls by the selling price. So, if each ball sells for $2.00, Charlie should expect to make $40.00 ($2.00 x 20).

However, if each ball sells for $1.50 instead, Charlie's total revenue will be $30.00 ($1.50 x 20). This means that Charlie will lose $10.00.

Therefore, if Charlie wants to ensure that he makes $40.00 from selling 20 cotton balls, he should check if each ball sells for $2.00.<eos>"	2

I don't have the current context of the question. however, assuming that the question is asking for the amount of money lloyd makes in a week at the auction, here's the calculation:

1 week = 7 days
each day, lloyd sells 252 eggs at $2 each
so, total eggs sold in 1 week = 252 x 7 = 1764 eggs
total revenue from selling all the eggs = $2 x 1764 = $3,528

therefore, lloyd makes $3,528 in a week at the auction.<eos>"	3528

Cécilia has now bought a puppy. Her veterinarian told her that she should feed it 1 bowl of dog food a day for 180 days. Now, she will feed it 2 bowl a day for the rest of her life. If there are 110 bowl of food in one bowl, how many bowl of food will she use in the first year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that there are 365 days in a year:
- The number of bowls of food needed per day: 1 (as per Cécilia's statement)
- The number of days she plans to feed the puppy: 365 (as per the assumption above)
- The total number of bowls of food needed: 1 x 365 = 1330 bowls
- However, each bowl contains 110 servings of food, so the total number of servings needed: 1330 x 110 = 14990 servings
- The number of bowls of food used in the first year: 1 (as per Cécilia's statement)
- The number of bowls of food needed for the rest of the year (assuming there are 365 days in a year): (365 - 1) x 110 = 33450 servings
- The total number of servings needed for the first year: 1 + 33450 = 33451 servings
- The number of bowls of food used in the first year: 1 + 1330 = 1331 bowls
- The number of servings needed for the rest of the puppy's life: 33450 - 1330 = 32120 servings
- The number of bowls of food needed for the rest of the puppy's life: 32120 / 110 = 383 bowls
- The total number of bowls of food Cécilia will use for her puppy's life: 1 + 1330 + 383 = 1714 bowls.<eos>"	1714

Dan produces 3 roses. There are 25 roses on each tree, and each rose has 8 petals. How many petals do they have in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of petals, we can first find the number of roses and multiply it by the number of petals on each rose:

Number of roses = 3

Number of petals on each rose = 8

Total petals = 3 x 8 = 24

Therefore, Dan's roses have a total of 24 petals.<eos>"	24

Harry slept for 9 hours last night. He woke Jacques for only 2/3 of the time. How many hours did Harry sleep compared to Jacques?

Since Harry slept for 9 hours and Jacques was only woken up for 2/3 of the time, Harry slept for more hours than Jacques. 

The difference in the number of hours slept by Harry and Jacques is (9 - 2/3 of 9) = 3.5 hours.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. If 5 flowers fail to bloom, how many flowers will he have in 15 days?

Assuming that the flowers grow at a consistent rate of 2 per day, Ryan will have 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 flowers in 15 days. However, if the flowers fail to bloom at a rate of 1 every 3 days, Ryan will only have 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 flowers in 15 days.<eos>"	15

I don't have access to current market prices or perform financial calculations. however, based on your question, it seems that you are interested in calculating the future price of a bag that initially costs $20, with a 20% price increase every two months for 36 months. one way to calculate this would be to add the percentage increase for each two-month period, which would be 20% + 20% + 20% + ... + 20%, and then multiply this by the initial price of $20. however, since the price increase occurs every two months, the final price would be more than $20.<eos>"	20

$400 = x($10)
$400 = $10x
x = $400 / $10 = 40.

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math to find out how much each friend should pay if they split the money equally:

1) Calculate the total amount spent by each friend:
Friend 1 spent: $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 = $57.75
Friend 2 spent: $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 = $57.75
Friend 3 spent: $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 = $57.75

2) Divide the total amount spent by the number of friends to find out how much each friend should pay:
$57.75 ÷ 3 = $19.25

Therefore, each person should pay $19.25 if they were to split the money equally.<eos>"	19

Sarah decides to buy a new suit and a pair of shoes. She chooses a suit that costs $30 and a pair of shoes that costs $20. Sarah nurses her neighbor's child 4 times and receives $5 for each childcare. Sarah's parents give her $4 for cutting grass in the house. If Sarah had already saved $10 before starting the childcare business, how many times would she have to cut your grass in the house before she could buy the suit and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate how much money Sarah has after the two purchases: 
Sarah has $30 for the suit and $20 for the shoes, which equals $60. 

Now, let's calculate how many times Sarah has to cut the grass in the house before she can afford the suit and shoes. 

We can set up an equation: 

4x + $10 = $60 

4x + $10 = $60 

4x = $50 

x = $12.5 

So Sarah would have to cut the grass in the house 12.5 times before she could afford the suit and shoes. 

However, since she already has $10 saved up, she would only have to cut the grass 12.5 - 10 = 2.5 times before she can afford the suit and shoes.<eos>"	2

At the same store, Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. The next day, he counted 50 more than the previous day. If the total number of customers from the first to the third day was 500, how many customers did he count on the third day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the number of customers on the third day, we can use the formula:

Total number of customers on the third day = (Total number of customers on the first two days) + (Total number of customers on the third day)

Since the total number of customers from the first to the third day is 500, we can substitute this value in the formula as follows:

Total number of customers on the third day = (100 + 50) + Total number of customers on the third day
Total number of customers on the third day = 150 + Total number of customers on the third day

Thus, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers from the first to the third day, as follows:

Total number of customers on the third day = 500 - (100 + 50)
Total number of customers on the third day = 450

Therefore, Sloane counted 450 customers on the third day.<eos>"	450
