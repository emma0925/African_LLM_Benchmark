Josh decided to try to buy a substandard house and invest money, then sell it. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 renovating it. This increased the value of the houses he bought by 150%. How much profit did he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
$80,000 (cost of house) + $50,000 (cost of renovation) = $130,000 (total cost of house)
If he sold the house for $130,000, he would make a profit of $130,000 - $130,000 = $0. Therefore, he did not make any profit from this investment.<eos>"	0

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"<|system|>
You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. 

Let's say that Seattle has x sheep. 

According to the first sentence, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means that it has 2x as many sheep as Charleston. 

According to the second sentence, Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, which means that it has 4x as many sheep as Seattle. 

We can write this in equations as follows:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Charleston = 4 * Seattle

Now, we have two equations with three unknowns (Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle). We need another equation to solve for Seattle. 

From the third sentence, we can write an equation that involves only Seattle and some other variable y:

4 * Seattle + 2 * y = 8

Now, we have three equations:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
4 * Seattle + 2 * y = 8

We can solve for Seattle in the third equation and substitute it into the first two equations:

Seattle = 8 / (4 * y + 2)
Toulouse = 2 * (8 / (4 * y + 2)) = 16 / (2 * y + 2)
Charleston = 4 * (16 / (2 * y + 2)) = 64 / (2 * y + 2)

Now, we can solve for y in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation:

y = (64 / (2 * y + 2)) - 4
2 * y + 2 = 64 / y
y^2 = 64 / 2 = 32
y = sqrt(32) = 4

Substituting y into the first equation, we get:

Toulouse = 2 * (8 / (4 * 4 + 2)) = 16 / 10
Charleston = 4 * (16 / (2 * 4 + 2)) = 64 / 10

Therefore, Toulouse has 16/10 sheep, Charleston has 64/10 sheep, and Seattle has 8/4 = 2 sheep.<eos>"	2

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I apologize, but your question does not seem to be related to the given prompt about African languages. As a language model AI, I am programmed to assist in generating human-like language and responding to various types of questions. However, regarding your question about dividing juice and water, the formula to calculate the amount of water left in a mixture is to subtract the volume of the juice from the total volume of the mixture. For example, if you have 24 quarts of juice that is a third water and two thirds juice, and you want to know how much water is left after adding 15 quarts of juice with a ratio of three-fifths water to one-fifth juice, you can calculate as follows:

Total volume of mixture = 24 quarts + 15 quarts = 39 quarts
Volume of juice in mixture = 24 quarts * 2/3 = 16 quarts
Volume of water in mixture = 39 quarts - 16 quarts = 23 quarts

Therefore, after adding 15 quarts of juice with a ratio of three-fifths water to one-fifth juice, there will be 23 quarts of water left in the mixture.<eos>"	23

The candle melts about two centimeters every two hours when lit. How many centimeters will the candle have melted after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that the candle was lit at 1:00 PM and has been burning for 4 hours until 5:00 PM, the following calculation can be made:

- The candle melts 2 cm every 2 hours
- In 4 hours (2 hours per time interval), the candle will have melted 2 cm * 4 hours = 8 cm
- Therefore, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will have melted 8 cm.<eos>"	8

Terry drinks yogurt 2 times a day. Currently the yogurt on the market sells for 4 yogurts at $5.00. How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot provide an exact answer to this question as it is unclear whether terry drinks 2 times a day, or if he drinks 2 cups of yogurt each day. assuming that terry drinks 2 cups of yogurt each day, the cost of his yogurt intake in 30 days would be:

(2 cups of yogurt per day x 30 days) / 2 = 150 cups of yogurt

now, we can calculate the cost of the yogurt based on the current market price of 4 yogurts at $5.00 each:

150 cups of yogurt x $5.00/4 cups = $187.50

therefore, terry would spend $187.50 on yogurt in 30 days.<eos>"	30

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Dana can walk at two miles [3 km] an hour, she can cover a distance of 2 x 6 = 12 miles [19.2 km] in six hours. In the first three hours (one third of the time), she will walk 2 miles [3 km], and in the remaining three hours (two thirds of the time), she will run 3 miles [4.8 km]. Therefore, her total distance covered in six hours is 2 miles [3 km] (walking) + 3 miles [4.8 km] (running) = 5 miles [8 km] approximately.<eos>"	8

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If each candle sells for $2.00, and Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of honeycombs, then he can make a total of 200 candles (20 x 10) from two pounds of honeycombs. The total revenue would be $400.00 ($2.00 per candle x 200 candles). 

However, Charlie needs to deduct the cost of the honeycombs and the string of candles, which is $10.00 per pound. This means that he needs to spend $20.00 in total for the materials to make 200 candles.

Therefore, his total profit would be $400.00 - $20.00 = $380.00.<eos>"	380

A wooden bridge carries a weight of less than 5000 pounds. A truck carrying identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, is allowed to cross the bridge. The weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can this vehicle reach without exceeding its own weight to cross the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The total weight of the driver and the unladen vehicle is 3755 pounds. The weight of each box is 15 pounds, and the total weight of the boxes would be n * 15 pounds. The total weight allowed to cross the bridge is less than 5000 pounds.

We can write this as a mathematical equation:

n * 15 + 3755 = 5000

Solving for n, we get:

n = (5000 - 3755) / 15

n = 10

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry without exceeding its own weight to cross the bridge is 10 boxes.<eos>"	10

To calculate the total amount Aleena paid at the end of the year, we need to add the basic fee and the additional 10% fee she received in the second half of the year.

Basic fee = $140 a month

Additional 10% fee = 10% of $140 = $14

So, in the first half of the year, Aleena paid a total of $140 + $14 = $154.

In the second half of the year, she paid $140 + $14 + 10% of $140 = $154 + $14 + $14 = $182.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid at the end of the year is $182.<eos>"	182

Each school has 2 teams (boys and girls)
Each team has 5 players
Each school has also sent a coach to each team
Total number of players in all the teams = 4 (schools) x 2 (teams) x 5 (players per team) = 40
Total number of coaches sent by each school = 4 (schools) x 2 (teams) x 1 (coach per team) = 20 
Total number of people sent by all the schools = 40 (players) + 20 (coaches) = 60<eos>"	60

Answer only. 
When Freda cooks canned onions into vegetables, they are reduced to a fraction of their original size. Each bowl of onions contains three onions. Freda's last bowl of onions weighed 32 ounces.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Answer: 

To find out how many onions are in 3 bowls of cooked vegetables, we need to first find out how many onions are in one bowl of cooked vegetables. 

According to the statement, each bowl of onions contains three onions. So, if we assume that Freda cooked three bowls of vegetables with canned onions, then there would be 9 onions in total (3 bowls x 3 onions per bowl = 9 onions). 

However, the statement also tells us that Freda's last bowl of onions weighed 32 ounces. We can use this information to find out how many onions are in one bowl of cooked vegetables. 

We know that each bowl of onions contains three onions, so we can set up a proportion:

3 onions / 32 ounces = 1 onion / x ounces

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3 x x ounces = 32 ounces

Solving for x, we get:

x = 32 ounces / 3

x = 10.67 ounces

So, one bowl of cooked vegetables with canned onions would weigh approximately 10.67 ounces. 

Now, let's say that Freda cooked a total of 5 bowls of vegetables with canned onions. Then, the total weight of onions would be:

5 bowls x 10.67 ounces per bowl = 57.35 ounces

Therefore, there were approximately 57.35 ounces of onions in the 5 bowls of cooked vegetables. 

I hope this answer helps!<eos>"	5

Julia's boat hit a hole in the ocean. The boat was taking two liters of water for every 10 meters she drove to shore. It took her six seconds to reach two meters. The yacht was 64 seconds behind us. How much water had the boat taken by the time Julia reached shore?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The boat had taken 2 liters of water for every 10 meters driven, so we can assume that Julia's boat had taken 2 liters of water for the distance she drove to shore. We know that the boat took 6 seconds to reach two meters, so we can assume that she drove 2 meters in 6 seconds. To find the total distance she traveled, we need to multiply the distance she traveled per second by the time it took her to reach shore. So, the calculation would be: 

(2 meters per second x 6 seconds) + (2 liters per 10 meters x 2 meters) = 24 meters 

Therefore, Julia's boat had taken 24 meters of water by the time she reached shore.<eos>"	24

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot perform arithmetic operations as it goes beyond my capabilities. however, i can provide you with an example of how to calculate the cost of each item with a 10% tax on non-food items:

let's assume that the price of each item is as follows:

- milk: $2
- eggs: $3
- light bulbs: $3
- cups: $3
- towels: $4

if there is a 10% tax on non-food items, the price of each item would be:

- milk: $2.2 (rounded to two decimal places)
- eggs: $3.3 (rounded to two decimal places)
- light bulbs: $3.3 (rounded to two decimal places)
- cups: $3.3 (rounded to two decimal places)
- towels: $4.4 (rounded to two decimal places)

therefore, the total cost of these items with the tax applied would be:

$2.2 + $3.3 + $3.3 + $3.3 + $4.4 = $13.1 (rounded to two decimal places)

note: the tax is calculated on non-food items only. if there are other items that are subject to a different tax rate or exemption, then the calculation would be different.<eos>"	13

<eos>
<|assistant|>
As a language model AI, I cannot provide an exact answer to your question without further information about the interest rate and the amount of profit Kim has put into her business. However, based on the information given, it can be assumed that the profit Kim would make per week from her housekeeping business, in dollars, would be:

Profit = (Number of clients x Weekly income per client) - (Number of clients x Cost of bottled water per client) - (Number of clients x Cost of clean clothes per client)
Profit = (3 x $290) - (3 x $2) - (3 x $5)
Profit = $775 - $3 - $15
Profit = $762

If a bag of colored diamonds costs $20 and this price increases by 20% every two months from the beginning, how much will a bag of colored diamonds cost after 36 months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as a language model AI, I cannot predict the exact cost of a bag of colored diamonds after 36 months, as the information provided only gives a hypothetical scenario. However, based on the given information, we can calculate the estimated cost of the bag of colored diamonds after 36 months if the price increase follows the pattern of increasing by 20% every two months.

Let's assume that the initial cost of the bag of colored diamonds is $20. In the first two months, the price increases by 20% to $24. In the next two months, the price increases by another 20% to $28.80. In the next two months, the price increases by another 20% to $34.16. In the next two months, the price increases by another 20% to $41.33. In the last two months, the price increases by another 20% to $49.40.

Therefore, after 36 months, the estimated cost of the bag of colored diamonds is approximately $49.40. However, this is just an estimation based on the given information, and the actual cost could be different.<eos>"	49

Billy cooks and slices almonds in preparation for making almond salads for an outdoor dinner to be served at a family gathering. It's a big event, so he has 60 almonds to use. All the almonds are about the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to cook and slice each one. Billy cooks the almonds in one and a half minutes, but it takes him 5 seconds to slice them. How long will it take to finish cooking the almonds?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
We know that Billy can cook 60 almonds in 1 and a half minutes. Let's say he wants to cook all 60 almonds in the same amount of time. 

How many seconds would it take him to cook 60 almonds if he takes 5 seconds to slice each one? 

Billy would need to spend a total of 5 seconds x 60 almonds = 300 seconds to cook all the almonds if he spends 5 seconds slicing each one. 

However, we know that it takes him 1 and a half minutes to cook 60 almonds. This is equivalent to 90 seconds. 

Therefore, it would take Billy less time to cook all 60 almonds if he spent 5 seconds slicing each one. He would need to spend a total of 5 seconds x 60 almonds = 300 seconds to cook all the almonds. 

So, the answer is that it would take Billy 300 seconds to finish cooking the almonds if he spent 5 seconds slicing each one.<eos>"	5

The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 a sack. If the transportation of each sack from the field to the warehouse would be $2, if the merchant made a profit of $400 in total after selling all the sacks at $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's begin by finding the total cost of transportation for all the sacks:

Number of sacks * Transportation cost per sack = Total transportation cost

Since we don't know the number of sacks, we can't calculate the total transportation cost. Let's move on to the next step.

The profit made by the merchant is $400. We know that the cost of each sack of wheat is $20, so let's find out how many sacks the merchant bought in total.

Profit = Selling price per sack - Cost per sack * Number of sacks sold

$400 = $30 * Number of sacks sold - $20 * Number of sacks sold

30 * Number of sacks sold = $400 + $20 * Number of sacks sold

30 * Number of sacks sold = $420

Number of sacks sold = $420 / 30

Number of sacks sold = 14

Therefore, the merchant sold 14 sacks of wheat.<eos>"	14

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating the total cost of the trip:

Total cost = $20.25 (tickets) + $4.40 (meal) + $33 (transportation) = $57.65

To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people:

Total cost ÷ 3 = $19.55

So each of the three friends paid $19.55 for their trip.<eos>"	19

Her parents pay her $4 for every time she cuts the grass in the yard. If Sarah had saved $10 before she started raising children, how many times would she have to cut the grass in the yard to get a jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

- The cost of the jacket = $30
- The cost of the shoes = $20
- Total cost of clothes = $50

- Sara earns $5 for each time she raises the neighbor's children
- She wants to save $10 to buy the clothes
- Total amount needed to save = $50
- Number of times she needs to cut the grass = Total amount needed to save / Amount earned per time
- Number of times she needs to cut the grass = $50 / $5 = 10 times

Therefore, Sara will need to cut the grass 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.<eos>"	10

Lori wants to buy a pair of $320 shoes and a matching belt for $32.00 She has a job that pays $8.00 an hour. How many hours will she have to work to buy what she wants?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math! 

First, we need to find out how much money Lori will need to buy the shoes and belt. 

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a belt for $32. So, the total cost will be $352. 

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Lori will need to work to earn $352. 

We know that Lori's job pays $8.00 an hour. So, we can set up an equation: 

$8.00 x hours = $352 

Now, we need to solve for hours: 

hours = $352 / $8.00 

hours = 43.95 

Since Lori can't buy the shoes and belt with a fraction of an hour, we can round up to the nearest whole number: 

hours = 44 

So, Lori will need to work for 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt she wants.<eos>"	44

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Mary is two years older than Joan, but Joan is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the average age of the three girls?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
We can solve this problem by using the concept of averages. 

First, we find the total age of all three girls by adding up their individual ages: 

20 (Jessa's age) + 2 (Mary's age) + 5 (Joan's age) = 37 

Next, we divide this total age by the number of girls, which is 3, to get the average age: 

37 / 3 = 12.33 

So the average age of the three girls is approximately 12.33 years.<eos>"	12

Isabelle bought supplies for her brother's birthday party. $12 for the cake, $43 for the birthday gifts, $15 for the artwork, $4 for the invitations, and $22 for the gift bags for the party guests. She divided the money equally between herself and her two parents. How much did each of them pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

First, we need to find out how much money Isabelle received from each parent. We can assume that each parent pays the same amount. 

Let's call the amount each parent pays ""x"". 

Isabelle bought supplies for the party and spent $12 on the cake, $43 on the birthday gifts, $15 on the artwork, $4 on the invitations, and $22 on the gift bags for the party guests. 

We can write this as an equation: 

12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = x 

Next, we need to divide the total amount of money spent on the party ($120) equally between Isabelle and her two parents. 

So, the total amount of money they spent is: 

2 x x + $120 

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 1/2: 

1/2 (2 x x + $120) = 1/2 x + $60 

Now, we can solve for ""x"" and get: 

x = $60 

So, each parent pays $60. 

Therefore, Isabelle and each of her parents pay $60 each for the party supplies.<eos>"	60
