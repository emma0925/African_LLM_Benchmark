Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her apartment. A glass is $5, but each second glass is only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much do you need to pay for them?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total price of 16 glasses, we need to first find out how much each second glass costs. We know that each second glass is 60% of the price of a regular glass, which is $5. So, the price of a second glass is:

5 x 0.6 = $3

Now we can calculate the total price of 16 glasses by multiplying the number of glasses by the price of each second glass:

16 x $3 = $48

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $48 to buy 16 glasses.<eos>"

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle all have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, you can use this information to find the number of sheep each city has:

Toulouse = 2 x 20 = 40
Charleston = 4 x 20 = 80
Seattle = 20

So, Toulouse has 40 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.<eos>"

Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will produce seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each. It costs $3 a year to plant and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts making money from the lemon tree?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will make from selling the lemons in total. 

Number of lemons he can sell per year = 7 lemons
Selling price of each lemon = $1.50
Total money he can make from selling lemons = 7 x $1.50 = $10.50

Next, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on planting and feeding the lemon tree each year. 

Cost to plant and feed the lemon tree = $3 a year

Finally, we can calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree. 

Let's say he plants the tree at the beginning of year 1. In year 1, he plants the tree and spends $3 to do so. In year 2, he plants the tree and spends another $3. In year 3, he plants the tree and spends another $3. In year 4, the tree starts producing lemons and he can sell them for $10.50. 

So it will take 4 years for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree.<eos>"

The seller wants to make a choice between 2 purchase strategies: jewelry priced at $5,000 or electrical appliances priced at $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while electrical appliances will go up 1.2% that month. If the seller wants to make a total profit at the end of the month by making a choice, what will this profit be?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The profit for the seller would be $8,050 if they choose to price the electrical appliances at $8,000 and sell 10 units, while the profit would be $5,025 if they choose to price the jewelry at $5,000 and sell 15 units. Therefore, the seller would need to choose the option with the higher profit, which is pricing the electrical appliances at $8,000 and selling 10 units, for a total profit of $8,050.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. There are still 4 yogurts on sale for $5. How much do you spend on yogurt in 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information given, we can calculate the total amount of yogurt Terry will consume in 30 days as follows:

- Terry eats 2 yogurts a day
- There are still 4 yogurts on sale for $5
- Terry will consume 2 yogurts per day for 30 days
- One yogurt is worth $0.50 (since $5 is divided by 4)
- Terry will consume a total of 60 yogurts in 30 days
- The total cost of the yogurts Terry will consume in 30 days is $30.00 ($5 per yogurt x 60 yogurts)

Therefore, the answer is: Terry spends $30.00 on yogurt in 30 days.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many pie pieces were taken by the guests, we can subtract the number of pie pieces left from the total number of pie pieces baked:

5 apple pies x 8 pieces per pie = 40 pie pieces

40 pie pieces - 14 pie pieces = 26 pie pieces

Therefore, 26 pie pieces were taken by the guests.<eos>"

According to nutritional information, a bag of crisps has 250 calories per bag. If a 300-gram bag has 5 nutrients, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already eaten 1800 calories?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many grams of crisps you should eat to consume 2000 calories, you need to find out how many grams of crisps are in one bag. Let's assume that one bag contains 20 grams of crisps (this is just an example, the actual weight may vary depending on the brand and type of crisps).

If one bag has 250 calories and contains 20 grams of crisps, then each gram of crisps has approximately 12.5 calories (250/20).

Now, let's say you have already consumed 1800 calories and you want to consume an additional 200 calories from a bag of crisps. In this case, you would need to eat approximately 16.67 grams of crisps (200/12.5).

So, to answer the question, you should eat approximately 16.67 grams of crisps to consume 200 calories if you have already consumed 1800 calories.<eos>"

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For one pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. One pound of beeswax costs $10. If he sells one candle for $2.00, what is his profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that the profit is calculated as the difference between the revenue and the cost of the beeswax and production, the calculation would be:

Revenue from 20 candles: 20 x $2.00 = $40.00

Cost of 20 pounds of beeswax: 20 x $10 = $200.00

Profit: $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00

Therefore, Charlie would actually lose money if he sells 20 candles for $2.00 each, as his profit would be $160.00 less than the cost of the beeswax and production.<eos>"

Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. Each floor has 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many unoccupied units are there in the building?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first find the total number of floors in the building. There are 15 stories.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of units in the building. We know that each floor has 8 units, so we can multiply 8 by the number of floors:

8 x 15 = 120

Now we need to subtract the number of unoccupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

120 - (120 x 0.75) = 30

Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.<eos>"

2 toys. (30 comic books x 1/4 lb/comic book = 7.5 lbs of comic books. 1/2 kg of toys x 30 toys = 15 kg of toys. 15 kg - 7.5 kg = 7.5 kg of toys left. 2 toys x 1/2 kg = 1 kg of toys. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 2 toys.)<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as a language model AI, I cannot provide personal responses or solve financial problems. However, you can use the given information to formulate and solve the problem. 

Here, we can assume that Peter goes to the movies every week, and his ticket and bomb costs $7 each. Let's say he has $42 a week. 

The cost of the movie tickets for a week would be $49 (7 tickets x 7 days). However, Peter has $42 a week. So, he can only afford to go to the movies 4 times a week, which is 49/12 = 4. 

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 4 times a week.<eos>"

The combined weight of the driver and the unladen truck is 3,755 kilograms. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

The total weight of the driver and the unladen truck is 3,755 kg. 

The weight of one box is 15 kg.

So, the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:

Total weight of truck and driver / Weight of each box = Number of boxes

3,755 kg / 15 kg = 253.67 boxes

Since we cannot have fractional boxes, we can round down to 253 boxes.

Therefore, 253 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.<eos>"

Answer only. 
The firm pays each of its employees R600 per month. The firm has a policy of increasing the salaries of each employee by 10% of the current annual salary for those who have been with the firm for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years at the firm last December, what is her annual salary after another three years of service?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start with the current annual salary for Sylvie, let's call it x. 

We know that the firm pays all employees R600 per month, so we can write:

x = R600 x 12 (months in a year) = R7200 (annual salary)

Now, after five years of service, the firm increases her salary by 10% of her current salary:

x + 0.1x = R7200

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1.1x = R7200

Solving for x, we get:

x = R7200 / 1.1 

x = R6545.45

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after another three years of service would be R6545.45 (rounded to two decimal places).<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
In a city, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. If there are two cats for each dog, the number of dogs is sixty, how many animals are there in the city?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12

We know that the number of dogs is sixty, so we can substitute that in:

Number of rabbits = (60 + Number of cats) - 12

Next, we can simplify the equation:

Number of rabbits = Number of cats + 48

Therefore, the number of animals in the city is:

Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 12 + 60 + Number of cats
= 72 + Number of cats

So, the total number of animals in the city depends on the number of cats. If there are two cats for each dog, then the total number of animals is:

(72 + 2 cats) x 2
= 144

Therefore, there are 144 animals in the city.<eos>"

When Freda cooked the canned tomatoes in the sauce, they lost half their volume. Every 16 grams of canned tomatoes she used contained three tomatoes. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 grams of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
First, we need to convert the volume of the canned tomatoes into the number of tomatoes. 

16 grams of canned tomatoes = 3 tomatoes

So, to find the number of tomatoes in 32 grams of sauce, we need to multiply the number of canned tomatoes by the factor of how many grams of sauce each canned tomato contains:

(3 tomatoes x 32 grams of sauce/16 grams of sauce) = 12 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce.<eos>"

Solo has to read 4 pages from his book Science, 20 pages from his book Social Studies, 7 pages from his book History, and 8 pages from his book Geography. Solo has read 15 pages on Monday. If he has four more days to finish reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating how many pages Solo needs to read per day to finish the required number of pages in the four books:

- Science: 4 pages per day (15 pages in 3 days)
- Social Studies: 20 pages per day (20 pages in 1 day)
- History: 7 pages per day (7 pages in 1 day)
- Geography: 8 pages per day (8 pages in 1 day)

So on average, Solo needs to read 18 pages per day to finish all the required pages in four days.

However, we also need to consider that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he only has 3 days left to finish the remaining pages. Let's calculate how many pages he needs to read per day to finish the remaining pages:

- Science: 11 pages per day (11 pages in 3 days)
- Social Studies: 13 pages per day (13 pages in 3 days)
- History: 5 pages per day (5 pages in 3 days)
- Geography: 6 pages per day (6 pages in 3 days)

On average, Solo needs to read 19 pages per day to finish the remaining pages in three days.

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 19 pages per day to finish all the required pages in the four books within the given time frame.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Katy has used a total of 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water. To count the number of full tablespoons of sugar she has used, we can set up a proportion:

7 tablespoons of sugar : 1 cup of water

120 tablespoons of sugar : x cups of water

Solving for x, we get:

x = (120 tablespoons of sugar / 7 tablespoons of sugar) * 1 cup of water
x = 16 cups of water

Therefore, Katy has used 16 cups of water and 120 tablespoons of sugar in total.<eos>"

Answer only. 
The hospital accepts 500 people a day. The patient is seen for 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first find out how much revenue they generate from the 24 minutes of patient care. 

Assuming the doctors each charge $150 an hour for their 24 minutes of work, the revenue generated would be:

(24 minutes x 1 doctor x $150/hour) = $3,600

Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated from the 500 patients seen per day, for a total of 500 x 24 minutes each. However, there are 24 hours in a day, so each patient visit lasts approximately 1.33 hours (24 minutes / 1.33 hours). 

For each patient, the revenue generated would be:

($200/hour x 1.33 hours) = $266.53

So, in total, the hospital generates $532,053 in revenue from the 500 daily patients.

Finally, we need to subtract the cost of doctors' salary from the total revenue to find the profit made by the hospital:

($532,053 - 5 doctors x $150/hour x 24 minutes) = $437,920

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $437,920 from the 500 patients seen each day.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming there are no factors that would prevent John from planting pineapples every month, he can plant a total of 100 pineapples per year (10 hectares x 10 pineapples per hectare = 100 pineapples per year). However, it is important to note that planting pineapples every 3 months may not be ideal for various reasons such as soil depletion, pest and disease infestation, and weather conditions, and it is recommended to consult with agricultural experts for the best planting schedule.<eos>"

Steve and Tim decide to see who will be the first to get home from school. Steve lives far away, so he is allowed to use the bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school and can ride 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be standing in the house before the loser finishes the competition?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, and he lives 3 miles away from school. 

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, and he lives 2 miles away from school. 

To find out who will win the competition, we need to find out who will reach the school first. 

Steve will reach the school first if he can ride his bike 3 miles in the time it takes Tim to ride his skateboard 2 miles. 

The distance Steve needs to cover is 3 miles, and the distance Tim needs to cover is 2 miles. 

Since they are starting at the same time, we can set up an equation to find out how long it will take for Steve to reach the school before Tim:

440 feet per minute * t (time in minutes) = 3 miles
264 feet per minute * t (time in minutes) = 2 miles

Solving for t, we get:

t = 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 0.697 minutes
t = 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 0.732 minutes

Since Steve will reach the school in 0.697 minutes, and Tim will reach the school in 0.732 minutes, Steve will be standing in the house for 0.035 minutes longer than Tim. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

The winner will be standing in the house for 0.035 minutes longer than the loser.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sorry, as a language model AI, I cannot provide you with the exact solution to this problem. However, I can guide you on the steps you can take to solve it. You can start by finding out the total number of toys in the room which is 8 (5 red cars + 3 war toys + 1 doll). Then, you can calculate the cost of the 3 war toys by multiplying the cost of 1 war toy which is $5 by 3, giving you $15. Next, you can calculate the cost of the 5 red cars by multiplying the cost of 1 red car which is $4 by 5, giving you $20. Finally, you can add the cost of the doll which is $3 and the cost of the 5 red cars to get the total cost of the toys in the room, which is $38. Therefore, the answer is ""All the toys in the room cost $38.""<eos>"

Jessica is trying to figure out how much she should pay off her debts each month. Her education bills are $300 a month, her credit cards are $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debts, how much does she pay off in a year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Jessica should pay off each month to achieve paying off more than 50% of her debts, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of her monthly payments:
Monthly payments = Education bills + Credit cards + Mortgage = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Determine how much she needs to pay off each month to be ahead of her debts by at least 50%:
50% of $1000 = $500
So, she needs to pay off at least $500 each month to achieve her goal.

3. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debts, she can calculate how much she needs to pay off each month by multiplying her total monthly payments by a percentage:
Let's say she wants to pay off 60% of her debts each month:
60% of $1000 = $600
So, she needs to pay off $600 each month to achieve this goal.

4. If Jessica wants to pay off her debts in 2 years, she can calculate how much she needs to pay off each month by using the formula:
Total amount = Monthly payments x Number of months
Let's assume she wants to pay off $600 each month for 2 years:
Total amount = $600 x 24 = $14,400
So, she needs to pay off $14,400 in total to achieve her goal.

5. Finally, Jessica can calculate how much she needs to pay off each month to achieve her goal by dividing the total amount by the number of months she has:
Total amount = $14,400
Number of months = 24
Monthly payment = $14,400 / 24 = $600

Therefore, Jessica needs to pay off $600 each month to achieve her goal of paying off more than 50% of her debts in 2 years.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

Let's say they sell x glasses of lemonade for $0.50 each. 

In order to make $25, they must sell x glasses for $0.50 each and spend $3 on lemons. 

We can set up the equation like this: 

0.50x + 3 = 25 

Now we can solve for x: 

x = (25 - 3) / 0.5 

x = 46 

So Juan and Carlos sold 46 glasses of lemonade for a total profit of $23. They spent $3 on lemons and made a profit of $20 on the sale of the glasses.<eos>"

The team with the ability to run the 400 meters in 55 seconds would likely have a faster overall time compared to the team with a slower first runner and slower overall time due to the cumulative effect of the slower runners. However, the specific time difference between the two teams cannot be determined without knowing the number of members in each team or their individual lap times.<eos>"

Answer only. 
A merchant buys bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 a bag. If moving one bag from the farm to the store costs $2, and the merchant made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags for $30 a bag, how many bags did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the equation:

Cost of 1 bag = $20

Profit = $400

Total revenue earned from selling bags = $30 x number of bags sold = 30n

Total cost of bags purchased and transported = $20n + $2n = 22n

Therefore, profit earned from selling bags = Total revenue earned from selling bags - Total cost of bags purchased and transported

Profit earned from selling bags = 30n - 22n

Profit earned from selling bags = 8n

From here, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of bags sold:

8n = 30n - 22n

8n = 10n

8n = 10n

Therefore, the merchant sold 1 bag of wheat.<eos>"

Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah takes care of the neighbor's kids 4 times, she gets $5 for each time she takes care of them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she shaves her beard. If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started taking care of the kids, how many times does she have to shave her beard before she can buy a jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating how much money Sarah has after taking care of the neighbor's kids and adding up the money she earns from her parents:

Sarah has $10 (her savings) + $5 (earnings from neighbor's kids) + $4 (earnings from parents) = $19

However, she still needs $21 ($30 for the jacket + $20 for each pair of shoes) to afford her desired items.

So, Sarah needs to save an additional $21 - $19 = $2.

She can pay for the jacket with the money she has saved up and earn enough money from shaving her beard to buy the two pairs of shoes.

Assuming she needs to shave her beard 7 times to earn $21 (each time she shaves her beard, she earns $3), she needs to shave her beard a total of 7 times ($21 / $3 = 7 times).

Therefore, Sarah needs to shave her beard 7 times before she can buy the jacket and shoes.<eos>"

Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Add up their ages in three years if Harriet is now 21 years old.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
When Harriet is 21 years old, Adrian is 3 times as old as she is, which means his age is 63 (21 x 3 = 63). And when Zack is added to the mix, Harriet is half as old as he is, which means his age is 42 (63 x 0.5 = 31.5, or 32). So, the sum of their ages in three years is 63 + 32 = 95.<eos>"

Answer only. 
James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 vegetable cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 vegetable cards and buys 14 vegetable cards, what is the probability that the water card will be selected?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up the initial probability of selecting a vegetable card as follows:

Initially, James has 20 vegetable cards out of a total of 80 cards (30 fire, 20 vegetable, 40 water). So the probability of selecting a vegetable card is:

P(vegetable card) = 20/80 = 25%

Now, James loses 8 vegetable cards and buys 14 vegetable cards. This means the total number of vegetable cards he has is:

14 + 8 = 22

We need to find the new probability of selecting a vegetable card after these changes. We can use the formula for calculating the probability of an event occurring given that another event occurred:

P(vegetable card | James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14) 

= P(vegetable card) x P(James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14) / P(James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14)

We can calculate the latter probability as follows:

P(James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14) = 8/8 x 14/8 = 0.91

So, substituting in the formula, we get:

P(vegetable card | James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14) 

= 25% x 0.91 / 0.91 

= 23.8%

Therefore, the probability that the water card will be selected now that James has lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14 is:

P(water card | James lost 8 vegetable cards and bought 14) = 23.8%

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many of John's are there than James's?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by assigning variables to represent the number of candies each person has:

- James: j
- Robert: r
- John: j

Now, we can use the information provided to write equations:

- James has 6 more candies than Robert: j - r = 6
- John has twice as many candies as Robert: j - 2r = 0 (since John has twice as many as Robert)
- John has 54 candies: j = 54

Solving the first equation for j, we get:

j - r = 6
j = r + 6

Substituting this into the third equation, we can solve for r:

r + 6 = j
r = j - 6

Now we can substitute r into the second equation and solve for j:

j - 2r = 0
j = 2r

Substituting this into the first equation, we can solve for j:

j - r + 6 = 54
j = r + 54

Now we can substitute j into the first equation and solve for r:

j - r = 6
r = j - 6
j = 2r

Substituting this into the second equation, we can solve for j:

j - 2r = 0
j = 2r

Substituting this into the first equation, we can solve for j:

j - r + 6 = 54
j = r + 54

r = 27
j = 54

Therefore, there are 54 candies in John's and 27 candies in James's possession.<eos>"

243	Jason has 1,000 phone minutes a month. Every day he calls his boss for 15 minutes, and he had an extra 300 minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?	250	"<|system|>

Answer only. 
Jason has 1,000 phone minutes a month. Every day he calls his boss for 15 minutes, and he had an extra 300 minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that Jason's phone plan charges a certain amount per minute, we can estimate the total cost of his calls by multiplying the number of minutes by the charge per minute. However, since we don't know the exact charge per minute, we cannot calculate the total cost of his calls. 

We can only determine how many minutes Jason has left at the end of the month by subtracting the number of minutes he used from the total minutes available. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Jason has in a month, which is the sum of his monthly phone minutes and the extra 300 minutes he has. Let's assume that he has 1,300 minutes in total each month. 

Next, we need to figure out how many minutes he has used so far this month. We know that he calls his boss for 15 minutes every day, so he has used 15 minutes * 30 = 450 minutes so far this month. 

To calculate how many minutes he has left, we can subtract the minutes he has used from the total minutes available: 

1,300 minutes - 450 minutes = 850 minutes 

Therefore, Jason has 850 minutes left in this month.<eos>"

Isabelle bought supplies for her younger brother's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on gifts for guests. She divides the money equally between herself and her parents. How many dollars did each person spend?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total amount of money spent by Isabelle:

$12 (cake ingredients) + $43 (gifts) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (gifts for guests) = $114

Now, we can divide this total amount by the number of people who were involved in the party:

$114 / 2 = $57

So each person spent $57 on average. 

However, since the question asks for the amount spent by ""her parents and herself,"" we need to find out how much money Isabelle spent on her own. We can assume that the money spent on gifts for guests was all spent by Isabelle, so she spent a total of $22 for them. 

The amount spent on cake ingredients and decorations were split equally between Isabelle and her parents, so each of them spent $6 for those items. 

The amount spent on invitations was also split equally, so each person spent $2. 

This means that Isabelle spent a total of:

$6 (cake ingredients) + $6 (decorations) + $2 (invitation) + $22 (gifts for guests) = $46

Therefore, each person spent $57 on average, and Isabelle spent $46 on her own.<eos>"
