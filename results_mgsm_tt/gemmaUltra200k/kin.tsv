Determined to find a home, Josh bought a house for $800,000 and renovated it for $50,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I am not authorized to perform financial calculations as it requires access to real-time market data. However, based on the given information, the profit made by Josh is calculated as follows:

Profit = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100%

Profit = ($800,000 + $50,000) / $800,000 * 100%

Profit = 62.5%

Therefore, Josh made a profit of 62.5% on the renovation project.<eos>"

John drove for 3 hours at 60mph, then returned home because he realized he had forgotten something important at home. He tried to get home in 4 hours but spent 2 hours in the ambulance. He spent an hour and a half driving at 30mph before he was able to drive at 80mph for the remaining 4 hours. How far did he go home after 4 hours?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The distance John drove during the first three hours at 60mph is 72 miles (60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles). During the second three hours, he spent 2 hours in the ambulance, so he did not drive during this time. 

After John returned home, he spent an hour and a half driving at 30mph, which means he covered 45 miles (30 mph x 1.5 hours = 45 miles). 

During the last four hours, he was able to drive at 80mph for the remaining distance, which is 240 miles (80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles). However, he only needs to go a distance equal to the distance he drove during the first three hours and the time he spent driving at 30mph, which is 72 miles + 45 miles = 117 miles. Therefore, he drove 117 miles after the fourth hour.<eos>"

Eliza's hourly rate for a 40-hour work week is $10. She receives an additional hourly rate of 1.2 times her hourly rate. If Eliza works 45 hours a week, how much will she be paid this week?

You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
Siobhan has 2 more rings than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more rings than half of Raymond's rings. If Raymond has 40 rings, how many rings does Siobhan have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information. 

Let's assume that R is the number of rings that Raymond has. 

From the first statement, we can write: 

Siobhan's rings = R + 2 

Now, we can use the second statement to find the value of R: 

5R/2 = R + 4 

Solving for R, we get: 

R = (2 x 5R/2) / 5 

R = 2R 

Therefore, we can substitute R into the first equation to find the number of rings that Siobhan has: 

Siobhan's rings = 2R + 2 

Siobhan's rings = 2(2R + 1) 

Siobhan's rings = 4R + 2 

So, if Raymond has 40 rings, Siobhan has 4R + 2 rings, which simplifies to: 

Siobhan's rings = 4(40) + 2 

Siobhan's rings = 168 

Therefore, Siobhan has 168 rings.<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They now sell 4 yogurts for $5.00 How much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, the total amount he would eat in 30 days would be 60 yogurts (2 yogurts per day x 30 days). 

If each yogurt costs $0.50, then Terry would spend $30.00 on yogurt in 30 days.

However, if Terry now eats 4 yogurts a day, the total amount he would eat in 30 days would be 120 yogurts (4 yogurts per day x 30 days). 

If each yogurt still costs $0.50, then Terry would spend $60.00 on yogurt in 30 days.

Therefore, Terry would spend $30.00 on yogurt in 30 days if he eats 2 yogurts a day, and $60.00 on yogurt in 30 days if he eats 4 yogurts a day.<eos>"

Dana can run at four times the speed of walking, but she can jump at half the speed of running. If she can jump 3 kilometers per hour, how many kilometers can she walk in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The speed of Dana's walking is 1 km/hour (since she can run at 4 times the speed of walking and her running speed is 3 km/hour). 

In six hours, she can walk a distance of: 1 km/hour x 6 hours = 6 km 

To calculate how much she can walk while running, we need to find out how much time she spends running during the six hours. 

Since she spends one third of the time running, we can assume that she spends 2 hours running (since 1 third of 6 hours is 2 hours). 

During those 2 hours, she can run a distance of: 3 km/hour x 2 hours = 6 km 

So, in total, Dana can walk a distance of 6 km and run a distance of 6 km during the six hours, assuming she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking.<eos>"

According to nutritional data, a bag of fiber has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many grams of fiber you can eat, you need to find the percentage of calories in a serving of fiber. Let's assume that the bag of fiber is 250 calories per serving.

250 calories is 25% of 1000 calories (250/1000=0.25).

Now, we need to find how many servings of fiber you can eat to reach your daily goal of 2000 calories. There are 5 servings in a 300g bag, so let's calculate how many servings of fiber you can eat to reach 2000 calories:

2000/250 = 8

You can eat 8 servings of fiber from a 300g bag, but you need to make sure that these servings are spread out throughout the day to meet your daily goals.

Finally, to answer the question, a 300g bag of fiber has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. If you have already eaten 1800 calories and your daily goal is 2000 calories, you can eat 3 more servings of fiber, which would be 3 x 250 calories = 750 calories.<eos>"

A mechanic charges different rates for repairing truck and car tires. for each truck tire that is broken, the mechanic charges $60 and for each car tire that is broken the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. on Friday the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires are repaired. How much money does the mechanic make on a typical workday?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating the total amount the mechanic charges for the truck tires:

6 truck tires x $60 each = $360

Next, we can calculate the total cost for the car tires:

4 car tires x $40 each = $160

To find the total amount the mechanic charges for all the tires, we can add the two values together:

$360 + $160 = $520

However, we need to account for the fact that there were 12 car tires repaired on Friday, but only 6 truck tires were repaired on Thursday. We can calculate the average cost per tire for Thursday and Friday separately:

Thursday: 6 truck tires x $60/each = $360
Friday: 12 car tires x $40/each = $480

To find the total amount earned by the mechanic, we need to add the cost of all the tires from Thursday and Friday:

$360 + $480 = $840

Therefore, the mechanic would earn $840 on a typical workday.<eos>"

A wooden truck can carry no more than 5000 kg. A pick-up truck filled with identical boxes each weighing 15 kg, passes through the truck. The weight of the driver attached to the empty truck is 3755 kg. How many boxes can be transported in the truck without exceeding the weight of the loaded box?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by calculating the total weight of the pick-up truck and the driver:

Total weight = 3755 kg (driver) + 5000 kg (empty truck) + weight of boxes (let's call it 'x')

The total weight of the pick-up truck and the driver is 8755 kg. 

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the weight limit of 5000 kg:

Total weight of boxes = 5000 kg - 8755 kg = -3755 kg

This means that the truck can carry up to 3755 kg of boxes without exceeding the weight limit. 

Now, we can calculate how many boxes can be loaded in the truck:

Number of boxes = Total weight of boxes / Weight of each box

Number of boxes = 3755 kg / 15 kg

Number of boxes = 25

Therefore, the truck can carry up to 25 boxes without exceeding the weight limit.<eos>"

Based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the exact number of healthy nuts in the basket.

This leaves 19 healthy nuts in the basket, as the other 2 nuts are bitter. Therefore, the answer is that there are 19 healthy nuts in the basket.<eos>"

How many kilometers does Sophia drive with one gas tank?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information provided, Sophia can calculate the average mileage per liter of gas by dividing the distance she has driven (100 km) by the amount of gas she used (4 liters). This would be 25 km per liter. 

To find out how many kilometers she can drive with one gas tank, she can multiply the capacity of her tank (12 liters) by the average mileage per liter (25 km). This gives her a rough estimate of 300 km (25 km x 12 liters).

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and may vary depending on factors such as driving habits, terrain, and weather conditions. It's always a good idea to err on the side of caution and plan for more fuel usage if possible.<eos>"

judy earns $15.00 per student for each class she teaches. if she teaches 5 classes daily, then in 1 day, she earns:

15 students x $15.00/student = $225.00

if she teaches on weekdays and Saturdays, then in 1 week, she teaches:

5 classes x 7 days = 35 classes

so, the total number of students she teaches in 1 week is:

15 students per class x 35 classes = 525 students

now, we can calculate how much judy earns in 1 week:

$15.00/student x 525 students = $7,975.00

therefore, judy earns $7,975.00 in 1 week.<eos>"

If Raymond did half as much laundry as Sarah, his total amount of laundry would be 200 pounds. 

If David did 4 times as much laundry as Raymond, his total amount of laundry would be 800 pounds. 

Therefore, the difference in the number of laundries Raymond and David did is: 

(800 - 200) = 600 pounds of laundry.<eos>"

There is no information given about the price of the 3-pack of flowers or the 2-pack of flowers in African currency, so it is impossible to calculate the exact amount of money Vicent will save. However, we can determine that by buying 18 flowers, he will pay a total of $30 (assuming the price of each flower is $1.50), and if the 3-pack of flowers is $2.50, he would have paid $7.50 for 18 flowers. Therefore, he would have saved $12.50 if the price of each flower in the 3-pack is the same as the price of one flower.<eos>"

You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
A football team has played 22 matches. Have they won 8 more than they lost? How many have they won?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To answer this question, we need to use the information given to us. 

Let's assume that the football team has won ""x"" number of matches and lost ""y"" number of matches. We know that they have played 22 matches in total.

Using this information, we can write a mathematical equation:

x + y = 22

Now, we need to make some assumptions to solve for ""x"". One possibility is that the team has won more matches than they have lost, so we can assume that ""x"" is greater than ""y"". 

Let's solve the equation for ""x"":

x + y = 22
x = 22 - y
x = 22 - (22 - y)
x = 22 - 22 + y
x = y

So, if the football team has won more matches than they have lost, then they have won ""y"" number of matches. 

Now, we can check if this is the case by comparing the given information with our assumption. 

If the football team has won 8 more than they lost, then ""x"" should be 8 more than ""y"". For example, if they have won 10 matches and lost 2, then ""x"" should be 12 (10 + 2). 

However, we don't have enough information to confirm whether this is the case or not. We can only conclude that if the football team has won more matches than they lost, then they have won ""y"" number of matches.<eos>"

Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies in total, how many copies did Harald sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The question is asking for the number of copies Harald sold, given that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's and they sold a total of 88,000 copies in total. 

Let's set up a proportion: 

10 copies of Marilyn's record sold for 88,000 copies of Harald's record 

This can be written as: 

10/1 = 88,000/x 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 88,000/10 

x = 8,800 copies 

Therefore, Harald sold 8,800 copies of his record.<eos>"

Lee could run the 400 meters in two seconds faster than Gerald could run the 400 meters. But Gerald changed his diet, and it increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how fast could Gerald run the 400 meters with a good diet in how many seconds?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first find the new speed of Lee after accounting for the 10% increase in speed due to Gerald's diet. 

Lee's new speed = 38 seconds x 1.1 = 41.8 seconds 

Now, we can use the equation: 

Time1/Speed1 = Time2/Speed2 

to find the new time it would take Lee to run the 400 meters with his new speed: 

Time2 = Time1 x Speed2/Speed1 

Time2 = 41.8 seconds x 4/38 = 5.1 seconds 

Therefore, if Lee had the same diet as Gerald and ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, he would need 5.1 seconds to run it with his new speed of 41.8 seconds.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's convert 16 grams of tomato sauce to 16 grams of tomatoes (since each 16 grams of tomato sauce contains three tomatoes). 

One tomato weighs approximately 100 grams. 

So, to find how many tomatoes Fred used, we can divide the total weight of tomato sauce by the weight of each tomato: 

Number of tomatoes = (Total weight of tomato sauce) / (Weight of each tomato)
Number of tomatoes = (32 x 100) / 100
Number of tomatoes = 32 

Therefore, Fred used 32 tomatoes for the tomato sauce.<eos>"

Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot determine the exact episode that Frankie watched on Wednesday. However, based on the information given, we can calculate that Frankie watched a total of 7 episodes, and since one episode of his favorite show aired for 1 hour every night except for Wednesday, when he watched a few episodes of 30 minutes, we can assume that he watched a total of 6 episodes of 1 hour and one episode of 30 minutes. Therefore, we can say that he watched the episode of 30 minutes on Wednesday.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Rory will pay, we need to first calculate the subtotal of the items ordered:

2 subs for $7.50 each = $15.00
2 packets of cookies for $1.50 each = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each = $2.00

The subtotal of these items is $18.00.

Next, we need to add the donation fee of 20%:

18.00 x 1.20 = $21.60

The new subtotal is $21.60.

Finally, we need to add the credit of $5.00:

21.60 + 5.00 = $26.60

Therefore, Rory will pay a total of $26.60.<eos>"

Mark took the test yesterday which consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions on the same level. If Mark had 8 hours to finish the first test and 6 hours to finish the second, how many questions did he have left unfilled?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate how much time Mark would have spent on the second test if he had the same amount of time as he did for the first test. 

Mark's average rate of 5 questions per hour is equivalent to 5/60 = 1/12 of a question every minute. So, if he had 6 hours to finish the second test, he would have 6 x 60 = 360 minutes, and with his rate of 1/12 of a question per minute, he would have 3,000 questions. 

However, the second test only consists of 100 questions, so Mark would have 3,000 - 100 = 2,900 questions left to answer.<eos>"

143	John bought the milk for $2, the eggs for $3, the lights for $3, the cups for $3, and the snacks for $4. If there is a 10% tax on everything other than food, how much did it cost at one time?	16	"<|system|>

John bought the milk for $2, the eggs for $3, the lights for $3, the cups for $3, and the snacks for $4. If there is a 10% tax on everything other than food, how much did it cost at one time?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of John's purchases including the 10% tax, we can start by calculating the subtotal of each item:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Lights: $3
- Cups: $3
- Snacks: $4

The subtotal of these items is $12.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on each item. To do that, we can multiply the subtotal by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

- Milk: $2 x 0.1 = $0.20 (tax on $2)
- Eggs: $3 x 0.1 = $0.30 (tax on $3)
- Lights: $3 x 0.1 = $0.30 (tax on $3)
- Cups: $3 x 0.1 = $0.30 (tax on $3)
- Snacks: $4 x 0.1 = $0.40 (tax on $4)

The total tax on these items is $1.20.

Finally, we need to add the tax to the subtotal to get the total cost:

- Milk: $2 + $0.20 = $2.20
- Eggs: $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
- Lights: $3 + $0.30 = $3.60
- Cups: $3 + $0.30 = $3.60
- Snacks: $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

The total cost of John's purchases with the 10% tax is:

$2.20 + $3.30 + $3.60 + $3.60 + $4.40 = $16.80

Therefore, John paid $16.80 in total for his purchases.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up a variable for the initial number of bees Debra saw leaving the hive in the first 6 hours, which is 30. 

We can use the formula: 

Total number of bees = Initial number of bees * (1 + fraction of bees that came back) 

Since we know that half of the bees left in the next 6 hours, we can calculate the fraction of bees that came back as 1/2. 

Plugging in the values: 

Total number of bees = 30 * (1 + 1/2) 

Total number of bees = 45 

Therefore, Debra saw 45 bees coming back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.<eos>"

Jackie tries to decide between paying her own taxes or hiring a bookkeeper.If she pays her own taxes, she will be able to work 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in income.The bookkeeper charges $90.How much more would she make if she hired a bookkeeper?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The calculation is as follows: 

If Jackie pays her own taxes, she will work 3 fewer hours per week and lose $35 per hour in income. This means she will earn $265 per week before taxes. 

If she hires a bookkeeper for $90 per week, she will save time and potentially earn a higher hourly rate. Let's assume she can work 4 hours per week more than before, and earns $50 per hour more. 

The calculation would be: 

$265 + $90 = $355 (weekly income without taxes) 
$355 + $50 = $405 (weekly income with taxes at 20% rate) 

Therefore, by hiring a bookkeeper, Jackie could potentially earn $405 - $265 = $140 more per week.<eos>"

Billy is pressing and cutting potatoes in preparation for making the first salad for his large family to gather for barbecue.It's a big party, so he has 60 potatoes to finish.The potatoes are the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to press and cut each one.It takes Billy about a minute and a half to press the potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it.How long will it take Billy to finish making the potatoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math! 

Billy has 60 potatoes to finish. 

Each potato takes him about 1 minute and 30 seconds (1.5 minutes) to press and cut. 

So, the total time it will take him to finish pressing and cutting all 60 potatoes is: 

(1 minute and 30 seconds) x 60 potatoes = 1 hour and 20 minutes 

Billy will need to spend 1 hour and 20 minutes pressing and cutting all the potatoes.<eos>"

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemons.For each lemon they make, it costs $3 for the lemon and $2 for the sugar.They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for each lemon.If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on the lemon?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the total cost of the lemons and sugar they used to make the 20 bottles.

Juan and Carlos sell each bottle for $0.50, so they must have made 40 bottles (20 bottles per lemon) for a total of $20 (40 bottles * $0.50).

To make each bottle, they need to use 2 lemons and 3 tablespoons of sugar. Let's assume that each lemon costs $1.50 (which is a common price for a lemon). Then the cost of each bottle is:

- 2 lemons * $1.50 = $3

- 3 tablespoons of sugar * $0.75 = $2.25

Total cost per bottle: $5.50

So, to make $25 in profit, they must have sold 44 bottles (20 bottles * $0.50 * 4).

Total revenue: $22.50 (44 bottles * $0.50)

Total cost: $11 (2 lemons * $1.50 + 22.50 * $0.25)

Profit: $11.25

Therefore, they spent $11.25 on the lemon and sugar to make the 20 bottles that generated $25 in profit.<eos>"

178	Rani has ten fingers more than Monic, and 4 fewer than Bo. If Bo has 40 fingers, count the total number of fingers the three of them have together.	122	"<|system|>

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Rani has ten fingers more than Monic, and 4 fewer than Bo. If Bo has 40 fingers, count the total number of fingers the three of them have together.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
First, we need to find out how many fingers each of them has individually. We know that Rani has 10 more fingers than Monic, and 4 fewer than Bo. Let's say Monic has x number of fingers. This means that Rani has 10 + x, and Bo has x + 4.

Now, we can add up the total number of fingers they have together, which is:

(Rani's fingers) + (Monic's fingers) + (Bo's fingers)
= (10 + x) + x + (x + 4)
= 3x + 14

We still need to figure out the value of x. One way to do this is to use the fact that Bo has 40 fingers, and subtract the number of fingers Monic has to get the number of fingers Rani has, then add 4 to get the total number of fingers they have together.

40 - (10 + x) = 30
40 - 10 - x = 30
30 + x = 40
x = 10

So, the total number of fingers they have together is:

(Rani's fingers) + (Monic's fingers) + (Bo's fingers)
= (10 + 10) + 10 + 4
= 34

Therefore, the total number of fingers they have together is 34.<eos>"

A merchant buys bags of wheat from a farmer for $20 per bag.If it costs $2 to transport one bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant earned $400 after selling all the bags for $30 each, how many bags did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's use the formula: Total cost of bags = Cost of each bag x Number of bags

We can rearrange the formula to find the number of bags: 

Number of bags = Total cost of bags / Cost of each bag

Plugging in the values, we get: 

Number of bags = $200 / $2 

Number of bags = 100

So the merchant sold 100 bags of wheat.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's begin by calculating how much each friend spent on the exhibition tickets:

1. To find out how much each ticket cost, we can divide the total amount spent on three tickets by 3: $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.
So each ticket cost $6.75.

2. Next, we need to calculate how much money each friend spent on the trip. Since they went on two separate trips and spent $33 each time, we can add these two values together: $33 + $33 = $66.
Therefore, each friend spent a total of $66 on both trips.

3. Finally, we need to divide the total amount spent on food ($4.50) by the number of friends: 3. We can also add this value to the total each friend spent on the trip ($66): $4.50 + $66 = $70.50.
So each friend ended up spending a total of $70.50 on the exhibition and food.<eos>"

To survive, each bat needs to eat 3.5 kg of insects per week.If there is a flock of ten bats, how many kg of insects do they need per day?

If each bat needs to eat 3.5 kg of insects per week, then the entire flock of ten bats needs:

10 bats x 3.5 kg/week = 35 kg/week

So, the flock of ten bats needs 35 kg of insects per week to survive. 

However, this information may be useful in calculating the number of insects a bat can eat in a day, which can be used to determine the total number of insects a bat can consume in a week, or any other related calculations.<eos>"

Sarah wants to buy a new coat and two pairs of shoes. The coat she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah takes care of the neighbor's children four times, getting $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she cuts the grass. If Sarah had already saved $10 before she started raising the kids, how many lawns would she have to cut before she could afford the coat and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

Sarah wants to buy a coat that costs $30 and two pairs of shoes that each cost $20. This means that the total cost of her desired items is $70.

She already has $10 saved up, so she needs to earn $60 more to reach her goal.

If she makes $5 per hour when she takes care of the neighbor's children, she needs to earn $60/5 = 12 hours of childcare.

She also earns $4 each time she cuts the grass, so let's say she needs to cut the grass 3 times to earn $12 ($4 x 3).

Therefore, Sarah needs to cut the grass 3 times in order to afford her desired coat and shoes, assuming she has no other sources of income.<eos>"

Jerry has a lot of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's set up an equation to solve this problem. 

Let's say Jerry has 'x' red chickens and 'y' white chickens. 

We know that red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, while white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. 

So, we can write: 

3x + 5y = 42 

Now, we know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. So, we can write: 

y - x = 2 

Solving these equations, we get: 

x = 10 

y = 12 

Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens and 12 white chickens.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot survey customers in real life. However, based on the information provided, we can find the total number of customers Sloane surveyed on the third day by using the percentage increase formula:

% increase = (number of customers on third day - number of customers on second day) / number of customers on second day x 100%

100% - 50% = 50% increase

This means that Sloane surveyed 50% more customers on the third day than she did on the second day.

To find the total number of customers Sloane surveyed on the third day, we can use the formula:

Total number of customers on third day = (500 x 50%) / (100%-50%)

Total number of customers on third day = 250

Therefore, Sloane surveyed 250 customers on the third day.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's first calculate the total number of cards James has: 

30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 

Now, we need to calculate the number of cards James has of the grass type, which is 20. We can divide this by the total number of cards to get the probability of selecting a grass card: 

20 / 90 = 0.2222 

Since we want the probability of the randomly selected card being a type of water, we can use the same formula: 

40 / 90 = 0.4444 

Therefore, the probability that James will select a water card is 0.4444 or 44.44%.<eos>"

Assuming they work continuously without any breaks, it would take them:

- (360 pieces / 4 pieces per minute) / 60 minutes = 15 hours to complete the puzzle if Callie was the only one working on it.
- 15 hours / 2 = 7.5 hours if Callie's mother was also working on it at the same time.

So it would take them approximately 7.5 hours to complete the puzzle if they worked on it together.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many seeds were not ready for harvest after two weeks, we can subtract the percentage of seeds that were ready from 100%:

100% - 30% = 70%

Therefore, 70% of the watermelon seeds were not ready for harvest after two weeks.

Next, we can convert the percentage to a fraction:

70% = 70/100

We can then divide the total number of watermelon seeds by the fraction to find the number of seeds that were not ready for harvest:

120 * 70/100 = 84

So, 84 watermelon seeds were not ready for harvest after two weeks.<eos>"

Assuming that Jason makes an average of 15 minutes of phone calls per day, he would need to make a total of 300 minutes of phone calls each day to meet his 1,000 minute monthly goal. 

If this month has 30 days, then Jason would have 300 minutes x 30 days = 9,000 minutes to make his calls. However, he has already used up 15 minutes of his daily quota, leaving him with 3,500 minutes for the rest of the month. 

Therefore, Jason still has 9,000 - 15 = 8,985 minutes left to meet his goal for the month.<eos>"
