In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 more. If her farm has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food should she give them for the last meal of the day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Since Wendi feeds her chickens 3 different bowls of food containing mixed seeds, mealworms, and vegetables, she can simply multiply the number of chickens she has by the number of bowls she gives them for each meal. Therefore, for the last meal of the day, she should give:

20 chickens x 3 bowls per chicken = 60 bowls of food for all of them.<eos>"
5	Kylar goes to the store in order to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay to buy them?	64	"<|system|>

Kylar goes to the store in order to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay to buy them?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of buying 16 glasses, we first need to determine the cost of one glass. As stated in the problem, a glass costs $5.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of each subsequent glass, which is 60% of the previous glass's cost. We can use the formula:

cost of ith glass = cost of (i-1)th glass * 0.6

where i is the number of the glass (starting from 1).

Using this formula, we can calculate the cost of each glass as follows:

1st glass: $5
2nd glass: $5 * 0.6 = $3
3rd glass: $3 * 0.6 = $1.80
4th glass: $1.80 * 0.6 = $1.08
5th glass: $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.65

We can continue this pattern for the remaining 11 glasses, but we can also see that the cost of each glass is decreasing rapidly. At this point, it may be more cost-effective to simply purchase the remaining glasses at full price.

Therefore, the total cost of buying 16 glasses would be:

1st glass: $5
2nd glass: $3
3rd glass: $1.80
4th glass: $1.08
5th glass: $0.65
6th-16th glass: $5 each (since the cost of each glass is less than $5, it is more cost-effective to buy them at full price)

Total cost: $5 + $3 + $1.80 + $1.08 + $0.65 + $5*11 = $60.65

Therefore, Kylar would have to pay $60.65 to buy 16 glasses.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I am not able to provide an answer to your question about the number of sheep in toulouse, charleston, and seattle. however, the given information can be used to determine the total number of sheep as follows:

- seattle has 20 sheep, as given in the problem statement.
- charleston has four times as many sheep as seattle, so charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
- toulouse has twice as many sheep as charleston, so toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

therefore, the total number of sheep in all three cities is 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.<eos>"

For the first 40 hours of work a week, Elisa's hourly rate is $10. For her overtime hours, she also receives 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours this week, what will her weekly wage be?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Elisa's hourly rate for the first 40 hours of work is $10. For overtime hours, she receives 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. 

To calculate her weekly wage for 45 hours of work, we first need to calculate the overtime rate:

Overtime rate = $10 x 1.2 = $12

Next, we need to calculate the total number of overtime hours worked:

Total overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Now we can calculate the total amount earned from overtime hours:

Overtime earnings = 5 hours x $12/hour = $60

Finally, we can calculate Elisa's total weekly wage:

Total weekly wage = 40 hours x $10/hour + $60 in overtime earnings = $400 + $60 = $460<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of downloads in the first three months, we need to add the downloads from each month. 

In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, which means 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30 percent, which means 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads. 

Therefore, the total number of downloads in the first three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times.<eos>"

6 dozen cheesecake cupcakes x $55/dozen = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $704<eos>"
12	Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The cost of planting is 90 dollars. Each year, the tree will produce seven lemons that will be sold for $1.5 each. Watering and nurturing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?	13	"<|system|>

Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The cost of planting is 90 dollars. Each year, the tree will produce seven lemons that will be sold for $1.5 each. Watering and nurturing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. This is the point at which the total revenue earned from selling the lemons is equal to the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree.

The total cost of planting the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the cost of watering and nurturing the tree is $3. The revenue earned from selling the lemons can be calculated as follows:

- The tree produces 7 lemons per year
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5
- Therefore, the total revenue earned from selling the lemons is 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year

To calculate the break-even point, we need to determine how many years it will take for the total revenue earned to reach $90 (the cost of planting the tree) plus the total cost of watering and nurturing the tree for that period of time.

Let's assume that the first year is a ""setup"" year, during which no revenue is earned, but only the planting and watering costs are incurred. Therefore, we only need to calculate the revenue earned in the second year and onward.

In the second year, the total cost of watering and nurturing the tree is $3, and the revenue earned from selling the lemons is $10.50. Therefore, the net profit in the second year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

In the third year, the total cost of watering and nurturing the tree is $6 (since it's the second year of maintenance), and the revenue earned from selling the lemons is still $10.50. Therefore, the net profit in the third year is $10.50 - $6 = $4.50.

In the fourth year, the total cost of watering and nurturing the tree is $9 (since it's the third year of maintenance), and the revenue earned from selling the lemons is still $10.50. Therefore, the net profit in the fourth year is $10.50 - $9 = $1.50.

From the fifth year onward, the total cost of watering and nurturing the tree remains at $12 (since it's the fourth year of maintenance), but the revenue earned from selling the lemons remains at $10.50. Therefore, the net profit in these years will be $10.50 - $12 = -$1.50.

In other words, Carlos will start making money from his lemon tree in the second year, with a net profit of $7.50. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that all lemons are sold at the same price, and that the cost of watering and nurturing the tree remains constant throughout the lifespan of the tree. In reality, there may be other factors that could affect the profitability of the lemon tree, such as fluctuations in the price of lemons or changes in the cost of maintaining the tree.<eos>"

Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He marked his first stop after 20 miles. He stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between the two stops?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the distance Henry traveled between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop.

Distance of first stop = 20 miles
Distance of second stop = 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it is 15 miles from the end of the trip.

To find the distance between the two stops, we can subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop.

Distance between the two stops = Distance of second stop - Distance of first stop
Distance between the two stops = 15 miles - 20 miles
Distance between the two stops = -5 miles

However, it is not possible to have a negative distance. This means that there must be an error in the given information. Perhaps the second stop was actually 15 miles before the first stop, or there was a mistake in the calculation of the distances.<eos>"

we also know that:

x + y = 162

using the first equation, we can express x in terms of y:

x = (7/11)y

substituting this into the second equation gives:

(7/11)y + y = 162

solving for y gives:

y = 108

therefore, in 10 years, allen's age will be:

y + 10 = 108 + 10 = 118 years old.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
Jean takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog needs half an hour a day to walk and do other things. To calculate how many hours a week Jean spends taking care of the dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of hours each dog needs. 

10 dogs x 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

If Jean takes care of the dogs every day, then she spends 5 hours a day or 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Terry spends on yogurt in 30 days, we first need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since four yogurts are sold for five dollars, the cost of one yogurt is:

1/4 of 5 dollars = 1.25 dollars

Therefore, Terry spends 1.25 dollars on each yogurt he eats. Since he eats two yogurts a day, the total amount of money he spends on yogurt in 30 days is:

2 yogurts/day x 30 days x 1.25 dollars/yogurt = 75 dollars

So, Terry spends 75 dollars on yogurt in 30 days.<eos>"

John runs 60 miles every week. He runs three days a week. On the first day he runs for three hours and runs twice less the other two days. What is his running speed?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
John's running speed can be calculated by dividing the total distance he runs by the total time he spends running. In this case, he runs 60 miles in a week, which is equivalent to 9 miles per day. On the first day, he runs for three hours, which means he runs at a speed of 3 miles per hour. On the remaining two days, he runs twice less, which means he runs at a speed of 1.5 miles per hour. To calculate his average speed for the week, we can add up the distance he runs on each day and divide by the total time spent running. This gives us an average speed of 2.5 miles per hour for the week.<eos>"
39	Dana runs four times faster than she walks, but jumps twice as fast as she runs. If she jumps at a speed of three miles per hour, how many miles does she cover in six hours, knowing that she spends one-third of that time running and two-thirds walking?	18	"<|system|>

Answer only. 
Dana runs four times faster than she walks, but jumps twice as fast as she runs. If she jumps at a speed of three miles per hour, how many miles does she cover in six hours, knowing that she spends one-third of that time running and two-thirds walking?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how fast Dana walks and runs. We know that she runs four times faster than she walks, so let's assume she walks at a speed of x miles per hour. This would mean that she runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour.

We also know that she jumps twice as fast as she runs, so let's assume she jumps at a speed of 2(4x) = 8x miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate how far she travels in six hours, taking into account the time she spends walking, running, and jumping.

In one hour, Dana spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking. This means that in one hour, she covers a distance of:

- 1/3 * 4x = 4/3 * x miles running
- 2/3 * x miles walking

In six hours, she covers a distance of:

- 6 * 4/3 * x = 8x miles running
- 6 * 2/3 * x = 4x miles walking

To find the total distance covered in six hours, we add the distances covered while running and walking:

8x + 4x = 12x miles

So, in six hours, Dana covers a distance of 12x miles.

We also know that she jumps at a speed of 8x miles per hour. During the time she spends walking and running, she covers a distance of 12x miles. This means that the distance she covers while jumping is:

8x miles per hour * 2/3 * 6 hours = 32x miles

Therefore, in six hours, Dana covers a total distance of:

12x + 32x = 44x miles

So, if Dana jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, she covers a distance of 44x miles in six hours, where x is the speed at which she walks.<eos>"

According to its nutritional information, a bag of potato chips contains 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag contains five servings, how many grams of potato chips would you eat, knowing that your daily calorie target is 2,000 and that you've already consumed 1,800 calories?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of grams of potato chips you can eat, you need to determine how many calories remain in your daily calorie target after accounting for the calories you've already consumed.

Total calories remaining = 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, you can calculate how many servings you can eat with the remaining 200 calories:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Therefore, you can eat 0.8 servings of potato chips, which would be approximately 24 grams (since a 300-gram bag contains five servings, 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving, and 60 grams x 0.8 servings = 48 grams).

However, it's important to keep in mind that this calculation assumes that you want to eat potato chips as a part of your meal, and that you have not exceeded your daily calorie target for the day. If you have already consumed more than 2,000 calories in a day, then you should not eat any additional potato chips.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Charlie's total cost for the 20 candles is $10 for the pound of beeswax and matches, which means his cost per candle is $10/20, or $0.50 per candle. Since he sells each candle for $2.00, his profit per candle is $2.00 - $0.50, or $1.50. Therefore, his total net profit for 20 candles is 20 x $1.50, which equals $30.00.<eos>"

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles during those three days.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles during those three days, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote on each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times as many articles as she wrote on Monday. 2/5 of 5 articles is 2 articles. So on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Twice 2 articles is 4 articles. So on Wednesday, Meredith wrote 4 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles during those three days:

(5 articles x 4 hours per article) + (2 articles x 4 hours per article) + (4 articles x 4 hours per article) = 20 hours + 8 hours + 16 hours = 44 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 44 hours writing articles during those three days.<eos>"

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have the ability to perform calculations, but i can provide you with the information you need to solve the problem. 

let's start by figuring out how many blue ties john bought. if he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, then he must have bought 5 blue ties ($200 / $40 = 5). 

since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he will buy 10 red ties (5 x 2 = 10). 

let's assume that the red ties cost x dollars each. we know that they cost 50% more than the blue ties, so we can set up an equation:

x = 1.5 * 40
x = 60

therefore, john spent $60 on each red tie. to calculate how much he spent on all the ties, we simply multiply the number of ties by the cost per tie:

total cost of blue ties = 5 x $40 = $200
total cost of red ties = 10 x $60 = $600
total cost of all ties = $200 + $600 = $800

john spent $800 on all the ties.<eos>"

Tom's boat is traveling at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 to 4 p.m., then makes the return trip at the speed of 6 miles per hour. How long will it take him to get back?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Tom's boat is traveling at a speed of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours from 1 to 4 p.m. On the return trip, his speed is 6 miles per hour. To calculate how long it will take him to get back, we need to determine the distance he travels in the first 3 hours and then calculate the time it will take him to cover that same distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

Distance traveled in 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
Distance = speed x time
Distance = 10 miles per hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it will take Tom to cover 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour:
Time = distance ÷ speed
Time = 30 miles ÷ 6 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to cover the 30 miles back to his starting point at a speed of 6 miles per hour.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Uriah's sack before he reduces it by 15 pounds. Let's assume that each toy weighs 1 pound, as mentioned in the given text.

Total weight of comic strips = 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds
Total weight of toys = (15 - 7.5) = 7.5 pounds

Now, we can determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds:

7.5 pounds / 1 pound per toy = 7.5 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 7 toys to reduce the total weight of his sack by 15 pounds.<eos>"

Assuming the boxes are packed tightly and evenly, the total weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:

Since each box weighs 15 lb, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:

1,245 lb / 15 lb per box = 83 boxes

Therefore, the driver can load up to 83 boxes onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.<eos>"

A basket contains 25 oranges of which one is damaged, 20 percent are not ripe, two are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many oranges are good, we need to calculate the percentage of good oranges in the basket. Since the basket contains 25 oranges, and 20 percent are not ripe, we can calculate the percentage of good oranges as follows:

Good oranges = Total oranges - Not ripe oranges - Damaged oranges - Sour oranges

Good oranges = 25 - (20/100 * 25) - 1 - 2

Good oranges = 25 - 5 - 1 - 2

Good oranges = 17

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.<eos>"

Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She spends $500 to get the manufacturing equipment, then an additional $800 to get it made by a jeweler. Then she spends 10 percent of that money to get it insured. How much did she spend in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Janet spent, we need to add up the three costs:

1. The cost of the manufacturing equipment: $500
2. The cost of getting the jewelry made by a jeweler: $800
3. The cost of insuring the jewelry: 10% of the total cost of the jewelry (which is $500 + $800 = $1300)

So, the total amount Janet spent is:

$500 + $800 + (10% x $1300) = $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430

Therefore, Janet spent a total of $1430.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service at the end of the year, we first need to know how much she paid in the first half of the year. Since she subscribed to a service that charges $140 a month, we can assume she paid $140 x 6 = $840 in the first half of the year.

In the second half of the year, the streaming company charged 10% less than the first half. So, Aleena paid 90% of $140, which is $126, for each of the remaining 6 months. Therefore, the total amount she paid in the second half of the year is $126 x 6 = $756.

To get the total amount paid for the year, we add the amount paid in the first half to the amount paid in the second half: $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service at the end of the year.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have access to the specific information about the money that bailey started with. however, we can calculate the total amount of money she will have at the end of eight weeks if she gets a weekly allowance of $5 and ends up with a total of $100.

to calculate the total amount of money, we can use the formula:

total amount = starting amount + (weekly allowance x number of weeks)

in this case, we know that:

total amount = $100
weekly allowance = $5
number of weeks = 8

we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for the starting amount:

$100 = starting amount + ($5 x 8)
$100 = starting amount + $40
starting amount = $100 - $40
starting amount = $60

therefore, bailey started with $60.<eos>"

On weekdays, Judy gives five dance lessons every day and eight lessons on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in a week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Judy makes in a week, we need to first determine how many lessons she teaches in a week. 

On weekdays, Judy gives 5 dance lessons every day, which means she teaches a total of 5 x 5 = 25 lessons during the week. On Saturdays, she teaches 8 lessons, which brings the total number of lessons in a week to 25 + 8 = 33.

If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, then the total amount of money she makes in a week is:

33 lessons x 15 students per lesson x $15.00 per student = $6,900.00

Therefore, Judy makes $6,900.00 in a week.<eos>"

If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much money Artie will make, we need to first determine the price of each type of flower after rounding to the nearest dollar. 

Marigolds: $2.74 rounded to the nearest dollar is $3.00
Petunias: $1.87 rounded to the nearest dollar is $2.00
Begonias: $2.12 rounded to the nearest dollar is $2.00

Next, we need to multiply the number of pots sold by the price of each type of flower.

Marigolds: 12 pots x $3.00 per pot = $36.00
Petunias: 9 pots x $2.00 per pot = $18.00
Begonias: 17 pots x $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, we add up the total amount earned from each type of flower to get the total amount of money Artie will make.

Total amount earned = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $88.00 from selling 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.<eos>"

Luke spends time building sand castles on the beach. He notices that each floor of a sand castle has half the area of the lower floor. What is the average area of a floor, knowing that the sand castle has 4 and that the highest floor has an area of 16 square feet?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the average area of a floor, we need to calculate the total area of all the floors and divide it by the number of floors. 

We know that the highest floor has an area of 16 square feet, and that each floor has half the area of the lower floor. This means that the area of each floor forms a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/2. 

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a(1-r^n) / (1-r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. 

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4 (since there are 4 floors in the sand castle). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16(1-(1/2)^4) / (1-(1/2))

S = 16(1-1/16) / (1-1/2)

S = 16(15/16) / (1/2)

S = 15 / (1/2)

S = 30

So the total area of all the floors is 30 square feet. Dividing this by the number of floors (4), we get an average floor area of:

30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet. 

Therefore, the average area of a floor in Luke's sand castle is 7.5 square feet.<eos>"

Raymond does twice as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, calculate the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does, we can use the information that he does twice as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does 2 x 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.

To calculate the amount of laundry David does, we can use the information that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

The difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

800 pounds - 100 pounds = 700 pounds

Therefore, Raymond does 700 pounds more laundry than David.<eos>"

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs two less than four times Grace's weight. What is the sum of their two weights in pounds?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Alex weighs. We know that Alex weighs two less than four times Grace's weight, which is 125 pounds. So, four times Grace's weight would be:

4 x 125 = 500 pounds

If Alex weighs two less than this amount, then his weight would be:

500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, to find the sum of their weights, we simply add together Grace's weight and Alex's weight:

125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds

Therefore, the sum of Grace and Alex's weights is 623 pounds.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that the alarm went off three times in total (once for each time it was set to go off), and that it went off for different lengths of time each time it was turned on, we can calculate the total number of times the alarm went off as follows:

- The first time it went off four times.
- The second time it went off three times longer than the first time. This means it went off for a total of 4 + (4 x 3) = 16 times.
- The third time, it went off twice as long as the second time. This means it went off for a total of 16 + (16 x 2) = 48 times.

Therefore, the alarm went off a total of 48 times in the given scenario.<eos>"

Let's call the number of copies Marilyn sold ""M"" and the number of copies Harald sold ""H"". We know that M = 10H and that M + H = 88,000. Substituting M in terms of H, we get 10H + H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000. Dividing both sides by 11, we get H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.<eos>"

Christina throws a birthday party and asks for 0.75 gift bags per guest, since a quarter of the guests don't show up. Knowing that she invited 16 friends and that the gift bags cost $2 each, how much is she going to spend?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount that Christina will spend on gift bags, we first need to determine the total number of guests who will receive a gift bag. Since Christina invited 16 friends and expects a quarter of them not to show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend the party as follows:

16 guests x (1 - 1/4) = 12 guests

This means that Christina needs to prepare 12 gift bags in total.

The cost of each gift bag is $2, so the total cost can be calculated as follows:

12 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $24

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her birthday party.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first need to determine the total number of pounds needed for all the dinosaurs. 

For the adult dinosaurs:
20 adults x 10 pounds per adult = 200 pounds

For the child dinosaurs:
5 children x 5 pounds per child = 25 pounds

Total amount of potato salad needed:
200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets in total do all three of them have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so if Marcia has x pets, Jan has 3x pets. 

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Cindy has x-2 pets. 

We know Cindy has four pets, so we can set up an equation: 

x-2 = 4

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 6

So Cindy has 6 pets. 

If Jan has 3x pets, then she has: 

3 * 6 = 18 pets. 

All three of them combined have: 

6 + 18 = 24 pets.<eos>"

In a certain neighborhood, the population of pet rabbits is twelve units less than that of all the pet dogs and cats. If for each dog we count two cats and there are altogether 60 dogs, how many pets are there in total in the neighborhood?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding the number of cats in the neighborhood. Since for each dog we count two cats, and there are 60 dogs, we have:

Number of cats = 2 x 60 = 120 cats

Now, let's find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. We know that the population of pet rabbits is 12 units less than that of all the pet dogs and cats, so we have:

Total pets = (number of dogs + number of cats) + 12

Total pets = (60 + 120) + 12

Total pets = 192

Therefore, there are 192 pets in total in the neighborhood.<eos>"

Given that the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each friend rang the doorbell. 

The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times longer than the first friend, which means they rang the doorbell 20 * (1/4) = 5 times. 

The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times longer than the fourth friend, which means they rang the doorbell 60 * (1/10) = 6 times. 

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, as given in the problem.

Therefore, the total number of times the doorbell rang is 20 + 5 + 6 + 60 = 91 times.<eos>"

If he has only 4 days left to finish his reading, how many pages will it take him to read on an average day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first find the total number of pages he needs to read for all subjects:

4 pages (science) + 20 pages (social studies) + 7 pages (history) + 8 pages (geography) = 39 pages

If Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, then he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.

To read all 39 pages in 4 days, Solo needs to read an average of 39/4 = 9.75 pages per day.

But since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, he needs to read an average of (39 - 15) / 3 = 6 pages per day for the remaining 3 days.<eos>"

Henri is making cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the batch, he finds that he has made 15 more cookies than planned. He drops five of his cookies while he cools them and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many cookies Henri made last year, we need to first figure out how many he made this year after adjusting for the extra 15 cookies he made and the 5 that he dropped. 

110 cookies - 5 dropped cookies = 105 total cookies made this year

Since Henri wants to make twice as many as last year, we can multiply last year's total by 2 to get this year's total.

Last year's total = 105 cookies / 2 = 52.5 cookies

Since Henri can't make a fraction of a cookie, we can round up to 53 cookies made last year.<eos>"

A leak occurred in Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat started taking two liters of water every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to go twenty feet. The shore being 64 seconds, how much water had the boat taken when Julia reached the shore?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to convert the time it takes Julia to row 20 feet into a rate of feet per second. 16 seconds to row 20 feet gives us a rate of 20 feet per 16 seconds, or 1.25 feet per second.

Next, we can calculate the total distance Julia rows by multiplying her rate by the time it takes her to reach the shore. 1.25 feet per second x 64 seconds = 76 feet.

To find the amount of water the boat takes on, we can use the given rate of 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia rowed 76 feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on as follows: 76 feet / 10 feet per 2 liters = 3.8 liters.

Therefore, the boat took on 3.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.<eos>"

Therefore, there are 1,500 ducks in the photo that Jamal took.<eos>"

Sadie slept eight hours on Monday. She slept two hours less each of the two days that followed, because of certain obligations. Knowing that the rest of the week she slept one hour more than on those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total during the whole week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Monday, which means she slept 6 hours each of those days. 

For the remaining days of the week, we know that she slept one hour more than on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept 7 hours each day. 

In total, she slept:

8 hours (Monday) + 6 hours (Tuesday) + 6 hours (Wednesday) + 7 hours (Thursday) + 7 hours (Friday) + 7 hours (Saturday) = 36 hours. 

Therefore, Sadie slept 36 hours in total during the whole week.<eos>"

Dylan needed chicken sausages and fish sausages to make sausage rolls at a party. He bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 fish sausages more than there were chicken. How many sausages did Dylan buy altogether?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to know how many chicken sausages Dylan bought. Let's say he bought x chicken sausages. Then, according to the problem, he bought 6 fish sausages more than there were chicken. So, the total number of sausages he bought would be:

x + (x + 6) = 2x + 6

We don't know the value of x, so we can't give a specific answer. However, we can say that Dylan bought 2x + 6 sausages altogether.<eos>"

Answer only. 
After being transferred to a new school, Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily. If Lily has made 50 friends, how many friends do Lily and Amy have in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of friends Lily and Amy have, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. We know that Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily, so we can subtract 20 from the number of friends Amy has to get the number of friends Lily has.

If Lily has made 50 friends, then Amy has made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

To get the total number of friends, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:

50 + 70 = 120

Therefore, Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have access to the current exchange rate or any other economic data. however, i can provide you with a mathematical formula to calculate the profit of the hospital:

total revenue = (number of patients * hourly rate) - (doctors' fees * hourly rate)

total revenue = (500 patients * $200/hour) - (500 patients * $150/hour)

total revenue = $100,000 - $75,000

total revenue = $25,000

therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $25,000 from these consultations.<eos>"

Nissa hires 60 seasonal elves to play Santa's village in her department store. A third of the elves quit after kids threw up on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kicked them in the shin. How many elves are left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how many elves started working in the department store. We know that Nissa hired 60 seasonal elves to play Santa's village.

Next, we need to figure out how many elves quit after the first incident. A third of the elves quit after kids threw up on them, which means 60 * 1/3 = 20 elves quit. This leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves still working in the department store.

Finally, we need to figure out how many elves quit after the second incident. 10 of the remaining 40 elves quit after kids kicked them in the shin, which means 40 * 1/10 = 4 elves quit. This leaves 40 - 4 = 36 elves still working in the department store.

Therefore, there are 36 elves left in the department store.<eos>"

I do not have access to current exchange rates or other external data. however, i can provide you with a calculation based on the information given.

if john harvests his pineapples every three months, we can assume that he harvests 1/4 of his total crop each time. this means that he harvests 250 pineapples per harvest (1/4 of 1000).

in a year, john will have four harvests (assuming he harvests at the same time each quarter). therefore, he will harvest a total of 1000 pineapples in a year (4 harvests x 250 pineapples per harvest).<eos>"

If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, then we can calculate how many friends he has by multiplying his number of friends by 3, which gives us 36 friends. 

To find out how many friends Jacques has, we can use the same method of multiplying the number of friends he has by 4. So, if Charlie has 12 Facebook friends and Jacques has four times as many as Dorothy, we can calculate Jacques' number of friends as follows:

Jacques' friends = 36 x 4 = 144

Therefore, Jacques has 144 Facebook friends.<eos>"

How much money did she make that day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Shawnda made a total of $12.50 that day by inflating the tires of the bikes, tricycles, and unicycle. She charged 25 cents for each tire, and since there were 5 people who brought their bikes with two tires each, 3 people with tricycles, and 1 person with a unicycle, the total number of tires that needed inflation was:

5 people x 2 tires per person + 3 people x 3 tires per person + 1 person x 1 tire = 16 tires

Therefore, the total amount of money she made was:

16 tires x 25 cents per tire = $4.00

However, since she charged by the tire and not by the number of bikes or tricycles, she would have charged the following:

5 people x 2 tires x 25 cents per tire = $5.00 (for the bikes)
3 people x 3 tires x 25 cents per tire = $7.50 (for the tricycles)
1 person x 1 tire x 25 cents per tire = $0.25 (for the unicycle)

Adding all the amounts together, we get:

$5.00 + $7.50 + $0.25 = $12.50

So, Shawnda made a total of $12.50 that day.<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the starting price goes up 20% every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot do calculations, but i can provide you with the formula to calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months. the formula is:

cost after 36 months = starting price * (1 + inflation rate)^number of months

in this case, the starting price is $20, the inflation rate is 20% (or 0.2), and the number of months is 36. therefore, the formula becomes:

cost after 36 months = $20 * (1 + 0.2)^36

simplifying this formula, we get:

cost after 36 months = $20 * 2.71828^36

using a calculator, we can calculate the cost after 36 months to be approximately $4,295.39.<eos>"

Several toys are arranged in a room: five red cars, three figurines and a doll. The doll costs the price of the three figurines, and a red car costs $4. Knowing that a figurine costs $5, what is the total value of the toys?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The total value of the toys can be calculated by adding the cost of all the toys. We know that a figurine costs $5, and a red car costs $4. Therefore, the total value of the toys can be calculated as follows:

Total value = (Number of figurines x cost of each figurine) + (Number of red cars x cost of each red car)
Total value = (3 x $5) + (5 x $4)
Total value = $15 + $20
Total value = $35

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $35.<eos>"

The band orders new uniforms. Each uniform includes a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and trousers that cost the average price of the hat and jacket. What is the total cost of each uniform?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of each uniform, we need to first determine the cost of the jacket. Since it costs three times as much as the hat, we can multiply the cost of the hat by 3 to get the cost of the jacket:

Jacket cost = $25 x 3 = $75

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the trousers. Since they cost the average of the hat and jacket, we can add the cost of the hat and jacket together and divide the result by 2:

Trousers cost = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Finally, we can add the cost of the hat, jacket, and trousers together to get the total cost of each uniform:

Total uniform cost = $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (trousers) = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Jessica wonders how much money she has to pay each month to cover all of her debts. The minimum payment on her student loan is $300 a month, her credit card is $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay 50 percent more than the minimum, how much does she have to pay in a year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay in a year, we need to first determine the total minimum payment for all her debts. This is:

Total minimum payment = $300 (student loan) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1,000 per month

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to add 50% of the minimum payment to the total minimum payment. 50% of $1,000 is:

50% of total minimum payment = $1,000 x 0.5 = $500

So the total amount Jessica needs to pay in a year is:

Total annual payment = ($1,000 + $500) x 12 months = $12,000 + $6,000 = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica needs to pay $18,000 in a year to cover all her debts if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.<eos>"

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to find out the total amount of money they made from selling their lemonade. Since they sold 20 glasses at $0.50 each, they made a total of $10.

Next, we need to subtract the amount they spent on ingredients from the amount they made. We know they spent $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so their total expenses were $5.

To find out how much they spent on lemons specifically, we can subtract the amount they spent on sugar from their total expenses:

$5 - $2 = $3

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $3 on lemons.<eos>"

If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to first determine his total monthly expenses.

Rent: $6,000 x 1/4 = $1,500
Fuel: $6,000 x 1/3 = $2,000
Charity: $6,000 x 1/2 = $3,000
Daughter's expenses: $200
Wife's expenses: $700

Total expenses: $7,400

Since Zaid earns $6,000 per month, he will have:

$6,000 - $7,400 = -$1,400

This means that Zaid will have a negative balance of $1,400 after all his expenses and donations.<eos>"

Rani has ten more crabs than Monique, who has four fewer crabs than Bo. Knowing that Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of crabs, we first need to determine how many crabs Rani has. We know that she has ten more crabs than Monique, who has four fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:

Rani's crabs = Bo's crabs - Monique's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 40 - (4 - 10) + 10
Rani's crabs = 40 - (-6) + 10
Rani's crabs = 40 + 6 + 10
Rani's crabs = 56

Now that we know how many crabs Rani has, we can calculate the total number of crabs as follows:

Total crabs = Rani's crabs + Bo's crabs + Monique's crabs
Total crabs = 56 + 40 + (4 - 10)
Total crabs = 56 + 40 - 6
Total crabs = 90 - 6
Total crabs = 84

Therefore, the total number of crabs is 84.<eos>"

Jenna and her mother picked apples from their farm. Jenna picked twice as many apples as her mother. If her mother picked 20, how many apples did they pick altogether?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how many apples Jenna picked. We know that Jenna picked twice as many apples as her mother, so if her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate how many apples Jenna picked by multiplying 20 by 2:

20 x 2 = 40

So Jenna picked 40 apples.

Now that we know how many apples Jenna picked, we can add that to the number of apples her mother picked to find out how many apples they picked altogether:

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed to a 2% monthly interest, so if Mandy is able to pay that amount in three months, how much does she owe Benedict?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed on a 2% monthly interest, then after three months, the total amount she would owe Benedict can be calculated as follows:

$100 x (1 + 2% per month)^(3 months) = $100 x 1.02^(3) = $106.09 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Therefore, if Mandy is able to pay the $106.09 in three months, she will have paid off the original $100 loan plus the agreed-upon interest.<eos>"

A merchant buys a few sacks of wheat from a farmer at $20 a sack. Knowing that transporting a sack from the farm to the warehouse costs $2 and that all the sacks were sold at $30 a sack for a total profit of $400, how many sacks did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's do the math:

Total cost of wheat = number of sacks * $20 per sack
Total cost of transportation = number of sacks * $2 per sack

Total cost = (number of sacks * $20 per sack) + (number of sacks * $2 per sack)
Total cost = number of sacks * ($20 + $2)
Total cost = number of sacks * $22

Total profit = (number of sacks * $30 per sack) - (number of sacks * $22)
Total profit = number of sacks * ($30 - $22)
Total profit = number of sacks * $8

We know the total profit was $400, so:

$400 = number of sacks * $8
number of sacks = $400 / $8
number of sacks = 50

So the merchant sold 50 sacks of wheat.<eos>"

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He also cuts down 2 trees every year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot perform calculations. however, i can help you understand the problem and provide the necessary information to solve it.

to solve this problem, you need to perform the following calculations:

1. calculate the total number of trees tom plants in 10 years:
10 trees per year x 10 years = 100 trees

2. calculate the total number of trees tom cuts down in 10 years:
2 trees per year x 10 years = 20 trees

3. calculate the total number of trees tom has after planting and cutting down:
100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

4. calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:
80 trees x 30% = 24 trees

5. calculate the final number of trees tom has:
80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

therefore, tom has 56 trees left after 10 years, given that 30% of the trees die.<eos>"

A pen costs as much as a pencil and a piece of gum put together. If a pencil costs $1.20 and a piece of gum $0.30, what will be the price of eight pens?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have access to current pricing information. however, i can provide you with a formula to calculate the price of eight pens based on the given information. 

let's assume the cost of a pen is x. according to the problem, the cost of a pen is equal to the cost of a pencil and a piece of gum combined. therefore, we can write the equation:

x = $1.20 + $0.30

simplifying this equation, we get:

x = $1.50

now we know that each pen costs $1.50. to calculate the cost of eight pens, we can multiply the cost of one pen by eight:

cost of 8 pens = $1.50 x 8 = $12.00

therefore, the price of eight pens would be $12.00.<eos>"

We have to distribute 200 pounds of carrots to 40 restaurants in a certain city. If each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants in total, the total amount of carrots needed is:

40 restaurants x 2 pounds per restaurant = 80 pounds

However, we have a total of 200 pounds of carrots to distribute. Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards. 

In the first month, she collected three times as many cards as she started with, which means she collected 3 x 20 = 60 more cards. In total, she had 60 + 20 = 80 cards at the end of the first month. 

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, she collected 80 - 20 = 60 cards in the second month. 

In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. That means she collected 2 x (80 + 60) = 2 x 140 = 280 more cards in the third month. 

In total, Elaine now has 80 + 60 + 280 = 420 Pokemon cards.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Marc makes in a week, we need to know how much Publisher B pays him per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, we can assume that Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount Marc earns from both publishers:

- Publisher A: 5 cents per sentence x 1,000 sentences = $500
- Publisher B: 10 cents per sentence x 1,000 sentences = $1,000

Therefore, Marc makes a total of $1,500 in a week, in cents.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the average score Brinley needs to get on the sixth test, we first need to find the average of her scores on the first five tests. We add up her scores and divide by 5:

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 87.4

This means that to have an average of 93 for the semester, Brinley needs to get a score of 93 on the sixth test. 

However, since Mr. Bert allows students to take the worst grade point average of each semester, Brinley only needs to get a score that is better than her lowest score of 71. So, she needs to get a score of at least 72 on the sixth test to have an average of 93.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the weight of Joe's candy bag, we need to calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars and candy apples.

For each chocolate bar, its weight is 40 grams, and it weighs twice as much as a candy apple. So, the weight of a candy apple can be calculated as follows:

Weight of a candy apple = 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars and candy apples in Joe's bag:

Total weight = (number of chocolate bars x weight of each chocolate bar) + (number of candy apples x weight of each candy apple)

Total weight = (25 x 40 grams) + (80 x 20 grams)

Total weight = 1000 grams + 1600 grams

Total weight = 2600 grams

Therefore, the weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600 grams.<eos>"

Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket she chose costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids four times and earns $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 every time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To afford the jacket and two pairs of shoes, Sara needs a total of $100. She already has $10 saved, so she needs to save an additional $90. 

She earns $5 for each time she babysits, so she needs to babysit a total of 18 times to earn the additional $90 she needs. 

To calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to know how much money she earns per lawnmowing. If she earns $4 every time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn 22 times to earn the additional $90 she needs. 

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 22 times to afford the jacket and shoes.<eos>"

Jerry has a chicken farm. Red chickens produce three eggs a day, and white chickens produce five eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than there are red ones, how many red chickens does he have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of eggs produced by all of Jerry's chickens combined. We know that red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day. Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens and y white chickens. Then, the total number of eggs produced by his chickens can be expressed as:

3 * x + 5 * y = 42

We also know that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so:

y = x + 2

We can substitute this expression for y into the first equation, giving us:

3 * x + 5 * (x + 2) = 42

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3 * x + 5 * x + 10 = 42

8 * x = 32

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens. To find the number of white chickens, we can use the equation y = x + 2:

y = 4 + 2

y = 6

Therefore, Jerry has 6 white chickens.<eos>"

Gary likes to walk along the edge of the local park, which is shaped like a rectangle of 1.5 miles by 6. If he walks at 3 miles per hour, how many hours of walking does he do?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to first determine the perimeter of the park. The perimeter is the distance around the park, and can be calculated by adding the length of all four sides. Since the park is shaped like a rectangle, we can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length and width, and then adding them together.

Perimeter = (length x width) + (length x width)
Perimeter = (1.5 miles x 6 miles) + (1.5 miles x 6 miles)
Perimeter = 9 miles + 9 miles
Perimeter = 18 miles

Now that we know the perimeter of the park, we can calculate how many hours it takes Gary to walk around it. We know that he walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, so we can divide the perimeter of the park by his walking speed to determine how many hours it takes him to walk around it once.

Hours = Perimeter / Walking Speed
Hours = 18 miles / 3 miles per hour
Hours = 6 hours

Therefore, it takes Gary 6 hours to walk around the edge of the park once.<eos>"

Adrian is three times older than Harriet, who is half as old as Zack, and calculate the average age the three of them will be in three years' time, if Harriet is now 21.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
In three years' time, Harriet will be 24 years old. Therefore, the average age of the three of them in three years' time will be:

(3*Adrian's age + 21 + 24)/3 = (3*Adrian's age + 45)/3 = Adrian's age + 15

So, the average age will be the same as Adrian's age plus 15 years.<eos>"

Answer only. 
A water tank holds 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water is there now in the cistern?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

We know that the tank originally held 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so we can subtract 90 from 120 to find out how much water is left:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Now we know that there are 30 liters of water left in the tank. 

Next, we need to find out how much rainwater Celine collected. We know that she collected twice as much as what was left in the tank, so we can multiply 30 liters by 2:

30 liters x 2 = 60 liters

Now we know that Celine collected 60 liters of rainwater. 

To find out how much water is now in the cistern, we need to add the 30 liters that was left in the tank to the 60 liters of rainwater that Celine collected:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, there are now 90 liters of water in the cistern.<eos>"

James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, what is the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest whole number) that a randomly chosen card is water?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card is water, we need to first determine the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water cards and buying 14 grass cards. 

Total cards = 30 fire cards + 20 grass cards + 40 water cards - 8 water cards + 14 grass cards
Total cards = 96

To determine the percentage chance of choosing a water card, we need to divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 

Percentage chance of choosing a water card = (40 water cards / 96 total cards) * 100
Percentage chance of choosing a water card = 41.67%

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card is water is 42%.<eos>"

Kalinda is trying to make a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. She is able to place four pieces per minute. Her mother places twice as many pieces per minute. How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mother to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to first determine how many pieces they can put together in one hour. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, which equals 24 pieces per hour (4 pieces x 60 minutes). Her mother can place twice as many pieces per minute, which means she can place 8 pieces per minute, or 48 pieces per hour (8 pieces x 60 minutes).

Together, they can put 24 + 48 = 72 pieces together in one hour. 

To complete the entire 360-piece puzzle, they will need to work for 360 pieces / 72 pieces per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother 5 hours to complete the 360-piece puzzle.<eos>"

One watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30 percent of the watermelons were ready to be harvested, so she took them home. When she returned two weeks later, with three-quarters of the remaining watermelons ready, she harvested them. How many watermelons were still not ready for harvest after those two weeks?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
After Ashlyn harvested three-quarters of the remaining watermelons, there would be one-quarter left. To find out how many watermelons were still not ready for harvest, we need to know the total number of watermelons on the farm before Ashlyn started harvesting. Let's assume there were W watermelons on the farm.

After two months, 30 percent of the watermelons were ready to be harvested, so 0.3W watermelons were harvested. Two weeks later, three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ready, which means 0.75(W-0.3W) watermelons were harvested. Simplifying this expression, we get 0.45W watermelons were harvested in the second round.

To find out how many watermelons were still not ready for harvest after the second round of harvesting, we need to subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total number of watermelons on the farm. So, the answer is:

W - (0.3W + 0.45W) = W - 0.75W = 0.25W

Therefore, 25 percent of the watermelons were still not ready for harvest after the second round of harvesting.<eos>"

Marc buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars, then $1,000 more for the registration of each of them. How much does he spend in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Marc spends on the 12 cars, we need to first determine the total cost of the cars after tax. 

Since each car costs $20,000 and Marc pays 10% tax on the cars, the cost of each car after tax would be:

$20,000 x (1 - 0.1) = $18,000

So the total cost of the 12 cars after tax would be:

12 x $18,000 = $216,000

Next, Marc pays $1,000 for the registration of each car, so the total amount he spends on registration would be:

12 x $1,000 = $12,000

Therefore, the total amount Marc spends in total would be:

$216,000 + $12,000 = $228,000<eos>"

To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find out how many insects Dax found in total.

Total insects = Ants + (Ants x 2)
Total insects = 50 + (50 x 2)
Total insects = 50 + 100
Total insects = 150

Therefore, there were 150 insects in the garden.<eos>"

Jeanne's makeup artist charges her $250 an hour. She needs very expensive makeup for a movie she's starring in and it takes her six hours a day. She has to do it four times a week. The film runs for five weeks. After the film is finished, the makeup artist gives Jeanne a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. How much did Jeanne pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Jeanne paid, we need to first determine the total cost of the makeup artist's services. 

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and Jeanne needs six hours of makeup each day. If she needs to do it four times a week, that means she needs 6 hours x 4 days = 24 hours of makeup each week. 

So, the total cost for one week of makeup services would be 24 hours x $250 per hour = $6,000. 

For five weeks of filming, the total cost would be 5 weeks x $6,000 per week = $30,000. 

After the film is finished, the makeup artist gives Jeanne a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we can take 10% of the total cost: 

10% of $30,000 = $3,000 

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final amount Jeanne paid: 

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000 

So, Jeanne paid $27,000 for her makeup services.<eos>"

On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate five cookies on Monday and ate 13 the next day. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did her sister Sue consume?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total calories consumed by Sue on Monday and Tuesday, we first need to find out how many cookies she ate on those days. 

On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister, who ate five cookies. So, Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies on Monday. 

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday. 

Now, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue on both days:

Total calories on Monday = 20 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 4000 calories
Total calories on Tuesday = 26 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 5200 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed on Tuesday compared to Monday, we subtract the total calories from Monday from the total calories on Tuesday:

5200 calories - 4000 calories = 1200 calories more on Tuesday. 

Therefore, Sue consumed 1200 more calories on Tuesday compared to Monday.<eos>"
