Janet's aunt makes 16 eggs a day. She makes three for breakfast every morning, and then she makes four for her friends every day. She sells the leftovers at the farmer's market every day for $2 per egg. How much money does she make a day at the farmer's market?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The aunt makes a total of 16 eggs a day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast, which leaves her with 13 eggs to sell at the farmer's market. If she sells each egg for $2, she can make a total of $26 for the 13 eggs. However, since she already used 3 eggs for breakfast, she can only sell 10 eggs at the farmer's market. Therefore, she can make a total of $20 for the 10 eggs sold at the farmer's market.<eos>"

Josh decided to try the real estate business. He bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 to renovate the house. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the profit made by Josh, we first need to determine the selling price of the renovated house. 

The value of the house was increased by 150%, which means that the selling price would be:

$80,000 + ($80,000 x 150%) = $200,000

Next, we need to subtract the amount Josh invested in renovating the house:

$200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $150,000 from the sale of the renovated house.<eos>"

How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming Wendi feeds her chickens the same amount each time, she feeds a total of 45 cups of food per day (15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon). If she has a flock of 20 chickens, she would need to feed them a total of 22.5 cups of food per day (45 cups total / 20 chickens), or approximately 1.125 cups per chicken per day.<eos>"
5	Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each subsequent glass is only 60% off its price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for the glasses?	64	"<|system|>

Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for his new house. One glass costs $5, but each subsequent glass is only 60% off its price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for the glasses?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we first need to determine the price of each glass after the discount. For the first glass, the price is $5. For the second glass, the price is 60% off of $5, which is $2 (5*0.6). For the third glass, the price is 60% off of $2, which is $1.20 (2*0.6). We can continue this pattern for all 16 glasses.

To make it easier, let's create a table:

Glass   Price
1       $5.00
2       $2.00
3       $1.20
4       $0.72
5       $0.43
6       $0.26
7       $0.16
8       $0.09
9       $0.05
10      $0.03
11      $0.02
12      $0.01
13      $0.01
14      $0.01
15      $0.01
16      $0.01

The total cost of the glasses is the sum of the prices in the table, which is $8.94 (rounded to the nearest cent). Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $8.94 for 16 glasses.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot solve this problem without knowing the exact amount of time it takes for windows to update the applications and restart the download. however, if we assume that the update process takes a negligible amount of time, then we can calculate the total time it will take to download the file as follows:

total time = time to download 40% + time for windows update + time to download remaining 60%

time to download 40% = (40/100) * (2 gb/min) * (40% of file size/100% of file size) = 80 minutes

time for windows update = 20 minutes

time to download remaining 60% = (60/100) * (2 gb/min) * (60% of file size/100% of file size) = 120 minutes

total time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes + 120 minutes = 220 minutes

therefore, the total amount of time it will take to download the 200 gb file is 220 minutes.<eos>"

Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She was also paid 1.2 times her hourly wage if she worked as a waitress. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10, which means that for the remaining 5 hours of work, she would be paid 1.2 times her hourly wage. 

For the first 40 hours, Eliza's earnings would be:

40 hours x $10/hour = $400

For the remaining 5 hours, Eliza would be paid:

5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2 = $60

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week would be:

$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza earned $460 this week.<eos>"

A new program received 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month, but then it dropped by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did this program get in total in three months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
In the first month, the program received 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, which means it received 3 x 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the number of downloads dropped by 30%, which means it received 70% of the downloads from the previous month. 70% of 180 is 126 downloads. 

Therefore, the total number of downloads in three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.<eos>"

Marie ordered one boiled chicken for $12, 5 milk packs for $3 each, 4 toasters for $1.50 each, and some bottles of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the items Marie ordered. 

Marie ordered:
- 1 boiled chicken for $12
- 5 milk packs for $3 each, which equals a total of $15
- 4 toasters for $1.50 each, which equals a total of $6
- Some bottles of pizza for $8.50 per box

The total cost of all these items is: $12 + $15 + $6 + ($8.50 x number of boxes of pizza) = $50

To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can subtract the cost of all the other items from the total amount she paid:

$50 - $12 - $15 - $6 = ($8.50 x number of boxes of pizza)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$12.50 = ($8.50 x number of boxes of pizza)

To solve for the number of boxes of pizza, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8.50:

number of boxes of pizza = $12.50 / $8.50 ≈ 1.48

Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a box of pizza, we can round up to the nearest whole number:

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.<eos>"

Cynthia drinks ice cream every night. She buys boxes of ice cream with 15 kinds of ice cream in each box for $4.00 per box. After 60 days how much will she spend on ice cream?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Cynthia spends $4.00 per box of ice cream, and there are 15 kinds of ice cream in each box. After 60 days, we need to calculate how many boxes of ice cream Cynthia has bought. 

To do this, we can divide the number of days by the number of days in a month (30 days) to get the number of months, and then multiply this by the number of boxes bought per month.

60 days / 30 days per month = 2 months

2 months x 2 boxes per month = 4 boxes

So, Cynthia has bought 4 boxes of ice cream after 60 days. 

To calculate the total amount she has spent, we can multiply the cost per box by the number of boxes bought.

$4.00 per box x 4 boxes = $16.00

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent $16.00 on ice cream.<eos>"

You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
If she can run three miles an hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can assume that she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours in a span of 6 hours. 

If she can run 3 miles per hour, then in 2 hours she can cover a distance of 3 miles per hour x 2 hours = 6 miles. 

However, since she spends the remaining 4 hours walking, we need to determine her walking speed in order to calculate the total distance covered in 6 hours. Let's assume her walking speed is x miles per hour. 

In 4 hours, she can cover a distance of x miles per hour x 4 hours = 4x miles. 

Therefore, her total distance covered in 6 hours would be the distance she covered while running plus the distance she covered while walking, which is 6 miles + 4x miles. 

We don't have enough information to determine the value of x, so we cannot provide a specific answer for the total distance covered in 6 hours.<eos>"

Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health issues and reaches out to her clients every day as her full-time job. 1 blog article takes about 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday, on Tuesday the articles she wrote were 2/5 times as many as on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Count the number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 blog articles, and it took her about 4 hours to research and write each article. Therefore, she spent a total of 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing articles on Monday. 

On Tuesday, the number of articles she wrote was 2/5 times as many as on Monday. So, she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 2 articles. Since each article takes her 4 hours to research and write, she spent a total of 2 x 4 = 8 hours writing articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote 2 x 2 = 4 articles. Again, since each article takes her 4 hours to research and write, she spent a total of 4 x 4 = 16 hours writing articles on Wednesday.

To find the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days, we can add up the hours she spent on each day:

20 hours (Monday) + 8 hours (Tuesday) + 16 hours (Wednesday) = 44 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 44 hours writing blog articles over the three days.<eos>"

Candice puts 80 order notes in her bag before she leaves for her job at the coffee shop. On her way, she stops at the grocery store and buys order notes; at work, she puts this one order note on each of the 220 cups of coffee. If she has 23 remaining order notes left in total, how many order notes are in the packet she buys?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many order notes Candice puts on each cup of coffee. We know that she puts 80 order notes in her bag before leaving for work and then puts one order note on each of the 220 cups of coffee. This means that she uses up all 80 order notes in her bag for the 220 cups of coffee, leaving her with 23 order notes remaining.

To determine how many order notes are in the packet she buys, we need to subtract the 23 remaining order notes from the total number of order notes she has. We don't know how many order notes Candice starts with, so we can't give a definite answer. However, we can say that the packet she buys contains at least 57 order notes (80 - 23 = 57).<eos>"

Answer only. 
Lloyd owned a chicken farm. His chicken farm produced 252 eggs a day and he sold them for $2 a dozen. How much did Lloyd make on eggs per week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Lloyd made on eggs per week, we need to first determine the total amount of eggs he produced in a week. Since he produced 252 eggs a day, we can multiply that by 7 days to get the total number of eggs produced in a week:

252 eggs/day x 7 days = 1764 eggs/week

Now that we know how many eggs Lloyd produced in a week, we can calculate the total amount of money he made from selling those eggs. Since he sold them for $2 a dozen, we need to first determine how many dozen eggs he produced in a week:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now that we know how many dozen eggs he produced in a week, we can calculate the total amount of money he made from selling those eggs:

147 dozen eggs/week x $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd made $294 per week from selling his chicken eggs.<eos>"

Uriah's book bag was heavy. He had to remove 15 pounds of it. His comic books weighed a quarter of a pound each and his toys weighed a half pound each. If he collected 30 comic books, how many children's toys did he need to remove?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how much weight the comic books make up in total. Since each comic book weighs a quarter of a pound, and he has 30 of them, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books x 1/4 pound per comic book = 9 pounds

Now we know that the total weight of the comic books is 9 pounds, and we also know that the toys weigh a half pound each. Let's assume that he had x number of toys in his bag. The total weight of the toys would be:

x toys x 1/2 pound per toy = 15 pounds

We want to find out how many toys he needed to remove, so we need to subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight of the bag and then divide by the weight of one toy:

15 pounds (total weight of bag) - 9 pounds (weight of comic books) = 6 pounds

6 pounds divided by 1/2 pound per toy = 12 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 12 children's toys from his bag to make it lighter.<eos>"

The average weight of the driver and the truck if there is no one inside is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's maximum capacity, we first need to calculate the total weight of the truck and its driver. 

The total weight of the truck and its driver is 3755 pounds. 

Next, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and its driver from the bridge's maximum capacity, which is 5000 pounds. 

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

This means that the maximum weight that can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's capacity is 1245 pounds. 

To calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to divide the remaining weight (1245 pounds) by the weight of each box (15 pounds). 

1245 pounds / 15 pounds = 83 boxes

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge is 83 boxes.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the final cost of Stephen's groceries, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. The final bill for the groceries: $40.00
2. The sales tax (25% of the final bill): 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00
3. The delivery fee: $3.00
4. The tip: $4.00

Total cost: $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the final cost of Stephen's groceries was $57.00.<eos>"

If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year. Starting at age 20, she is entitled to 5% of the value of her pension each year. If she retires after 30 years, what is her annual pension?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years and is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 per year, she can receive an additional 5% of that amount each year starting at age 20. If she retires after 30 years, she would have received a total of 150% of her annual pension, or $75,000 per year.<eos>"

Alena subscribed to an online service for which she paid $140 per month. If the company charged her the first payment for the first half of the year and then charged 10% for the other half of the year, calculate the amount she paid for the online service at the end of the year.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount Alena paid for the online service at the end of the year, we need to add the amount she paid for the first half of the year to the amount she paid for the second half of the year, after taking into account the 10% discount.

Amount paid for first half of the year: $140 per month x 6 months = $840

Amount paid for second half of the year, after 10% discount: $140 per month x 6 months x 0.9 = $756

Total amount paid for the year: $840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Alena paid $1596 for the online service at the end of the year.<eos>"

How many miles could Sophia travel by filling up the gas tank?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sophia can travel a maximum of 480 miles by filling up the gas tank of her car. This is because she has already driven 100 miles with 4 gallons of gas in the tank, which means she has used 25% of the total gas capacity of her tank (4 gallons out of 12 gallons). If she fills up the tank completely, she will have 8 gallons of gas left, which can take her an additional 200 miles (8 gallons x 25 miles per gallon). Therefore, the total distance she can travel from the starting point is 100 miles + 200 miles = 480 miles.<eos>"

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to lie down and read for half of the time he spends watching. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot calculate time in weeks. however, if jim spends 2 hours watching tv and then lies down to read for half of that time, which is 1 hour, 3 times a week, we can calculate the total time he spends watching tv and reading in a week by multiplying the time by the number of days he does it. 

2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours watching tv
1 hour x 3 days = 3 hours reading

in total, jim spends 9 hours watching tv and reading every week. to calculate how much he spends in 4 weeks, we can multiply the weekly total by 4.

9 hours x 4 weeks = 36 hours

therefore, jim spends 36 hours watching tv and reading in 4 weeks.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
There are 4 schools competing in the basketball tournament, each sending a women's and a men's basketball team, each with 5 players. So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:

4 schools x 2 teams per school x 5 players per team = 40 players

In addition, each team has a coach, so the total number of coaches is:

4 schools x 2 teams per school x 1 coach per team = 8 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people who were sent by all the schools is:

40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot provide you with the exact answer as the initial amount of money bailey had is not given in the question. however, we can calculate the total amount of money she received in 8 weeks by adding her weekly allowance to the starting amount. let's assume that her starting amount was x. 

total amount = x + (5 * 8) 

on the 8th week, the total amount would be $100. 

therefore, 

100 = x + (5 * 8) 

100 = x + 40 

x = 100 - 40 

x = 60 

so, bailey started with $60.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Tommy raises money for charity by selling brownies for $3 each and cakes for $4 each. If Tommy sold 43 brownies and 23 cakes, how much did Tommy collect?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Tommy collected, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by their respective prices, and then add the results together.

For brownies, Tommy sold 43 pieces at $3 each, so he collected:
43 × $3 = $129

For cakes, Tommy sold 23 pieces at $4 each, so he collected:
23 × $4 = $92

To find the total amount collected, we add the amount from selling brownies and cakes:
$129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy collected a total of $221 for charity.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
In the reduced dollar value pricing, Artie would sell marigolds for $1 each, petunias for $1 each, and begonias for $1 each. 

So for the marigolds, Artie would sell 12 pots at $1 each, which would give him a total of $12. 

For the petunias, he would sell 9 pots at $1 each, which would give him a total of $9. 

For the begonias, he would sell 17 pots at $1 each, which would give him a total of $17. 

Therefore, Artie would get a total of $12 + $9 + $17 = $38 from selling all the pots.<eos>"

To calculate the number of stickers Charlie left, we need to add up the number of stickers he had at the beginning and the ones he received, then subtract the ones he gave away and used.

So, Charlie had 10 stickers at the beginning. He bought 21 from a grocery store and received 23 on his birthday, which gives him a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

He then gave his sister 9 stickers and used 28 for a greeting card, which means he has 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we first need to calculate the number of pets Marcia has. We know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, so Marcia has four pets as well.

Next, we know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. This means that Jan has 3 x 4 = 12 pets.

Finally, we can add up the number of pets Marcia and Jan have to find the total number of pets the three have: 4 + 12 = 16.

Therefore, the three of them have 16 pets in total.<eos>"

Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. How many hours did Harry sleep more than James?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours Harry slept more than James, we need to subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept. 

So, Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 2/3 of that, which is 2/3 of 9 hours. 2/3 of 9 hours is 6 hours. Therefore, Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours, which means Harry slept 3 hours more than James. 

Harry slept 3 hours more than James.<eos>"

Solo read 4 pages from his Science book, 20 pages from his Social Studies book, 7 pages from his Biography book and 8 pages from his Geography book. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he had 4 more days to complete all his studies, how many pages would he need to read, on average, in one day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read in four days, we can add up the number of pages he read on Monday and the number of pages he has left to read:

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (Biography) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages total

To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read in one day over the course of four days, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

39 pages total ÷ 4 days = 9.75 pages per day (rounded to 9.8 pages per day)

Therefore, Solo would need to read an average of 9.8 pages per day in order to complete all his studies within the remaining four days.<eos>"

The hospital sees about 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for about 24 minutes. The doctors charge 150 dollars an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges 200 dollars an hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the profit made by the hospital from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost of providing the services.

Total revenue = (number of patients) x (time per patient) x (hourly rate charged to patients) + (number of patients) x (time per patient) x (hourly rate charged by doctors)
= 500 patients x 24 minutes x ($200/hour) + 500 patients x 24 minutes x ($150/hour)
= $240,000 + $120,000
= $360,000

Total cost = (number of patients) x (time per patient) x (hourly rate charged by the hospital)
= 500 patients x 24 minutes x ($200/hour)
= $240,000

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $360,000 - $240,000
= $120,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $120,000 from these visits.<eos>"

Nissa hires 60 employees to play the elves in her Santa's village shop. Three-quarters of the elves quit after children threw up on them, and 10 percent of the remaining elves quit after the children died. How many elves are left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of elves who remain after the incidents. 

First, let's calculate the number of elves who quit after the children threw up on them. If Nissa hires 60 employees to play the elves, and three-quarters of them quit, then the number of elves who remain is:

60 - (3/4 x 60) = 60 - 45 = 15 elves

Next, let's calculate the number of elves who quit after the children died. If 10% of the remaining 15 elves quit, then the number of elves who remain is:

15 - (10% x 15) = 15 - 1.5 = 13.5 elves (rounded up to 14 elves)

Therefore, there are 14 elves left to work in Santa's village shop.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have access to the current date or time. however, i can provide an answer to your question based on the given information. 

pam rode the roller coaster twice, which means she used 2 tickets for that ride. 
fred rode the same ride four times, which means he used 4 tickets for the roller coaster. 

after that, they each rode the sled twice. let's calculate the total number of tickets they used for the sled ride. 
if each sled costs 6 tickets, then: 
- pam used 2 tickets for the roller coaster, leaving her with 4 tickets for the sled ride. 
- fred used 4 tickets for the roller coaster, leaving him with 2 tickets for the sled ride. 

in total, they used 6 tickets for the sled ride (2 from pam and 4 from fred). 

therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is: 
2 (for the roller coaster) + 4 (for the roller coaster) + 6 (for the sled ride) = 12 tickets. 

so, 12 tickets were used that day.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, and 6 times that distance on Tuesday, which would be 24 miles. To find the total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday, we can add the distances for each day: 4 + 24 + x = 41, where x is the distance he walked on Wednesday. Solving for x, we get x = 13 miles. Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.<eos>"

Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today he took another test with 100 questions similar to his time yesterday. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he have left to complete?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions, which means he answered 15 questions per hour. Since the second test had 100 questions, we can calculate the time he would need to complete it at the same rate as the first test: 100 questions / 15 questions per hour = 6.67 hours. 

However, he only had 6 hours to complete the second test, which means he needed to answer more questions per hour to finish on time. To calculate how many questions he answered in the second test, we can use the formula: 6 hours x 15 questions per hour = 90 questions. This means that Mark had 10 questions left to complete in the second test.<eos>"

in a candy machine, there are 22 more pink gumballs than there are blue gumballs. If there are 12 blue gumballs, how many pink gumballs?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to add the number of blue gumballs to the number of pink gumballs. Let's assume that there are ""x"" pink gumballs in the candy machine. According to the problem, there are 22 more pink gumballs than blue gumballs. So we can write an equation as follows:

x = 12 + 22

Now, let's solve the equation to find the number of pink gumballs.

x = 34

Therefore, there are 34 pink gumballs in the candy machine.<eos>"

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day and has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
As an AI language model, I cannot make judgments or give opinions, but I can provide you with an answer based on the information you provided. 

If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, we can assume that he spends 7 hours a week playing games (assuming he plays every day). If we compare that to the 16 hours he would work at his part-time job at $10 an hour, he would make $160 a week. 

However, if he were to spend that same time playing video games instead of working, we cannot determine how much money he would make since playing video games does not typically generate income in the same way as a job does.<eos>"

John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, how much will it cost for everything?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot perform calculations, but i can provide the formula to calculate the total cost of the items after tax. the formula is:

total cost = (cost of each item x quantity) + (tax rate x (cost of non-food items x quantity))

in this case, the cost of each item is:

milk: $2
eggs: $3
light bulbs: $3
cups: $3
roach traps: $4

the tax rate is 10%, which is equivalent to 0.1 in decimal form. the cost of non-food items is:

($3 + $3 + $4) = $10

therefore, the total cost after tax is:

total cost = ($2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4) + (0.1 x ($10))

total cost = $11 + $1

total cost = $12

so, the total cost of all the items after tax is $12.<eos>"

Kim started a housekeeping business and calculated how much profit he would make from his customers. He has 3 customers now, but he is talking to 5 other potential customers and feels strongly about getting them to include them in his calculations. The house of each customer would need 2 bottles of detergent and a foam area to clean one house. The bottles of detergent would cost $2 each, and the foam area would cost $5 each. These were the only costs he would have. He calculated that the total income per week would be $92.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information provided, it seems like Kim has already calculated the total income per week from his 3 current customers, which is $92. However, he is also considering adding 5 potential customers to his calculations. If all 5 of these potential customers become his customers, then he would have a total of 8 customers. 

To calculate the total income per week from all 8 customers, Kim would need to know how many houses each of his customers has. Let's assume that each of his customers has 1 house to clean. In that case, Kim would need to purchase 16 bottles of detergent (8 customers x 2 bottles per customer) and 8 foam areas (8 customers x 1 foam area per customer). 

The total cost of the supplies would be $40 (16 bottles of detergent x $2 per bottle) + $40 (8 foam areas x $5 per area) = $80. 

Assuming that Kim charges the same amount for each house, the total income per week from all 8 customers would be $92 x 8 = $736. 

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that Kim can clean all 8 houses in one week, which may not be feasible. He may need to adjust his pricing or consider hiring additional employees to handle the increased workload.<eos>"

Steve and Tim decided to see who could get home from school faster. Steve lives three miles from the school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives two miles from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes his race?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their destination.

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, and he lives 3 miles away from the school. We need to convert his speed to miles per hour and then calculate the time it takes him to reach his home.

1 minute = 60 feet
440 feet/minute = 440/60 feet/minute = 7.33 feet/second
1 mile = 5280 feet

So, Steve's speed in miles per hour is:

7.33 feet/second x (60 seconds/1 minute) x (1 mile/5280 feet) = 8.28 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Steve to reach his home:

3 miles / 8.28 miles per hour = 0.36 hours or 21.6 minutes

Similarly, Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, which is equivalent to 3.45 miles per hour. He lives 2 miles away from the school, and we can calculate the time it takes him to reach his home as follows:

2 miles / 3.45 miles per hour = 0.58 hours or 34.8 minutes

Therefore, the winner, Steve, will have to wait for the loser, Tim, for:

21.6 minutes - 34.8 minutes = -13.2 minutes

This means that Steve will have to wait for 13.2 minutes for Tim to reach his home. However, since it's not possible for Steve to wait for a negative amount of time, we can assume that Tim will reach his home before Steve does.<eos>"

On the first day, 5 people on bicycles come to be pressed on two tires. 3 people come to keep their tires pressed to adjust their speed. Finally, one person comes on a motorcycle. How many dollars did she make that day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the cost of each service she provided. 

For the 5 people who needed their tires pressed on their bicycles, each person paid 25 cents for each tire, which means each person paid a total of 50 cents. Since there were 5 people, the total amount earned from this service is 5 x 50 cents = $2.50.

For the 3 people who came to adjust their tire pressure, each person paid only 25 cents, so the total amount earned from this service is 3 x 25 cents = $0.75.

The final customer who came on a motorcycle did not specify how many tires needed to be pressed, so we cannot calculate the exact amount earned from this service. 

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is $2.50 + $0.75 = $3.25.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day, which means he had a total of 3 hours of classes per day on those days. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had two hours of lessons a day. 

To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spent attending classes in one semester, we need to multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days in a week and then by the number of weeks in a semester. 

For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo had 3 hours of classes per day, so the total number of hours for these days would be:

3 hours/day x 3 days/week x 16 weeks = 144 hours

For Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo had 2 hours of classes per day, so the total number of hours for these days would be:

2 hours/day x 2 days/week x 16 weeks = 64 hours

Adding the total number of hours for all the days, we get:

144 hours + 64 hours = 208 hours

Therefore, Kimo spent a total of 208 hours attending classes in one semester.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Jackie hired an accountant, she would save the time and effort of doing the tax collection herself. This would allow her to spend more time on her freelance work, potentially earning more income. However, she would also incur the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90.

To determine how much she would earn after hiring an accountant, we need to consider the trade-off between the lost income from not doing freelance work and the cost of hiring an accountant. If Jackie can earn $35 per hour as a freelancer, then she would lose $105 in income if she spends 3 hours on tax collection.

If she hires an accountant, her total cost would be $90. To break even, she would need to earn at least $90 in additional income from her freelance work. If she can earn more than $90 in additional income, then hiring an accountant would be a profitable decision.

Therefore, if Jackie can earn more than $90 in additional income from her freelance work by hiring an accountant, then it would be a profitable decision to hire an accountant.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot perform calculations. however, i can provide the information you need to calculate the cost of each uniform. 

according to the given information, the cost of the cap is us$25. the cost of the jacket is three times the cost of a suit, so if a suit costs x, the jacket will cost 3x. the cost of the trousers is the average of the cost of a suit and jacket, which can be calculated as (x + 3x) / 2 = 2x.

to calculate the total cost of each uniform, you would need to add the cost of the cap, jacket, and trousers together. the total cost would be us$25 + 3x + 2x = 5x + $25.<eos>"

If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much is she paying per year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the minimum for her bills, which means she is willing to pay a total of:

$300 (student loan minimum payment) + $200 (credit card minimum payment) + $500 (mortgage minimum payment) = $1000 per month

If she pays 50% more than the minimum, she will be paying:

$1500 per month ($1000 minimum + 50% more)

In a year, she will be paying:

$1500 x 12 months = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica will be paying $18,000 per year for all of her bills if she pays 50% more than the minimum.<eos>"

If Zaid earns $6000 per month, how much will he earn after these expenses and donations?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have the ability to perform calculations, but i can help you understand the problem.

zaid's monthly expenses are as follows:
- rent: 1/4 of his salary
- car fuel: 1/3 of his salary
- charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses

to calculate zaid's monthly expenses, you can follow these steps:

1. determine the amount zaid spends on rent and car fuel:
   - rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
   - car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000

2. subtract rent and car fuel expenses from zaid's monthly salary:
   - $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500

3. determine the amount zaid gives to charity:
   - half of $2500 = $1250

4. subtract charity expense from the remaining amount:
   - $2500 - $1250 = $1250

therefore, after all his expenses and donations, zaid will have $1250 left over from his monthly salary.<eos>"

Rani is ten strokes higher than Monic, who is 4 strokes lower than Bo. If Bo has 40 strokes, count the number of strokes plus all three strokes.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the given information, we can calculate the number of strokes for each player as follows:

- Bo has 40 strokes.
- Monic is 4 strokes lower than Bo, so she has 40 - 4 = 36 strokes.
- Rani is 10 strokes higher than Monic, so she has 36 + 10 = 46 strokes.

Therefore, the total number of strokes for all three players is:

40 + 36 + 46 = 122 strokes.<eos>"

If Jan is 30 years old and Mark was two years ago five and a half years younger than Jean, we can calculate Jean's age as follows:

Jean's age = Jan's age + 5.5 years
Jean's age = 30 years + 5.5 years
Jean's age = 35.5 years

Therefore, Jean is 35.5 years old.<eos>"

Two racing teams compete against each other in the 4 and 400 meter races; a race in which each competing team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one-to-one, along a standardized course. One of the two teams is surrounded by each other and each member of them will run the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is not so surrounded; their first runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds and each next runner will run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Using this information, how many seconds should the winning team have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Since the first runner of the non-surrounded team runs at 60 seconds for 400 meters, and each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous one, we can calculate the time for all four runners as follows:

First runner: 60 seconds
Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Therefore, the total time for the non-surrounded team to complete the 4 and 400 meter race would be:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 212 seconds

On the other hand, the surrounded team has each member running at a constant pace of 55 seconds for 400 meters. Therefore, their total time would be:

4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Since the non-surrounded team has a faster total time of 212 seconds, they should be the winners. Therefore, the winning team should have a time of 212 seconds.<eos>"

A merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each. If each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The merchant bought a certain number of sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 each, and each sack cost $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse. After selling all the sacks for $30 each, he made a total profit of $400. To determine how many sacks he sold, we can use the following equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Total profit
(Number of sacks sold x Selling price per sack) - (Number of sacks sold x Cost per sack) = Total profit

Substituting the given values, we get:

(Number of sacks sold x $30) - (Number of sacks sold x $2) = $400
(Number of sacks sold x ($30 - $2)) = $400
(Number of sacks sold x $28) = $400
Number of sacks sold = $400 / $28

Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets for the bus fare. They spent $4.50 on food less than the ticket fare. They also took 2 separate trips that cost $33 each. If they agreed to split all the money equally, how much did each of them pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount spent by the three friends. They spent $20.25 on bus tickets, $4.50 on food, and $33 for each of the two trips, for a total of $58.25.

If they split the total cost equally, each friend would pay:

$58.25 / 3 = $19.42 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Therefore, each of them would pay $19.42.<eos>"

John collects peaches for 3 hours. He can collect 2 peaches per minute. How many peaches does he collect?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
John collects 120 peaches in 3 hours because he can collect 2 peaches per minute, which means he can collect 60 peaches in one hour. Therefore, in three hours, he would collect 3 times 60, which equals 180 peaches. However, the given text only mentions that he collects 2 peaches per minute, so the calculation is based on that information.<eos>"

Pigeons need to eat an average of 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there is a flock of ten pigeons, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount of insects needed for a flock of ten pigeons, we need to multiply the average weight of insects needed per week by the number of pigeons in the flock. 

So, for ten pigeons, the daily amount of insects needed would be:

3.5 pounds of insects per week / 7 days per week = 0.5 pounds of insects per day

Therefore, a flock of ten pigeons needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.<eos>"

Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees are dead. How many trees does he have left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Tom plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years he would have planted a total of 100 trees. Every year he cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years he would have cut down a total of 20 trees. 

To calculate how many trees he has left, we need to subtract the number of trees he has cut down from the total number of trees he has planted:

100 trees (total planted) - 20 trees (total cut down) = 80 trees remaining

However, we also need to account for the fact that 30% of his trees are dead. To calculate the number of trees that are still alive, we need to multiply the total number of trees he has by the percentage that are still alive:

80 trees (total remaining) x 70% (percentage still alive) = 56 trees still alive

Therefore, Tom has 56 trees still alive after 10 years.<eos>"

Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and has saved $20 for this purchase. One pencil costs $2. How much change will she get?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the change that Violetta will get, we need to first determine how much money she needs to buy all 5 pencils. Since one pencil costs $2, we can multiply this by 5 to get the total cost of all 5 pencils:

$2 \times 5 = $10

This means that Violetta needs $10 to buy all 5 pencils. Since she has saved $20 for this purchase, we can subtract the cost of the pencils from the amount of money she has:

$20 - $10 = $10

This tells us that Violetta will have $10 left over after buying the pencils. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Violetta will get $10 in change.<eos>"

Mark was a copy-editor. In one week he edited the same number of sentences for two different authors, each of whom paid him a different amount of money per sentence. Author B paid Mark twice what Author A paid him. Mark edited a total of 1000 sentences per week, and Author A paid him 5 cents per sentence. How much did Mark make in a week, in terms of cents?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Mark edited a total of 1000 sentences per week. 
For Author A, Mark edited x sentences and was paid 5 cents per sentence, so he made a total of 0.05x dollars. 
For Author B, Mark edited (1000 - x) sentences and was paid twice what Author A paid him, so he made a total of 0.1(1000 - x) dollars. 
To find the total amount Mark made in a week, we add the earnings from both authors: 
0.05x + 0.1(1000 - x) = 50 - 0.05x 
Setting this equal to the total amount Mark made in a week, we have: 
50 - 0.05x + 0.1(1000 - x) = total amount made 
50 - 0.05x + 100 - 0.1x = total amount made 
-0.15x + 150 = total amount made 
Therefore, Mark made a total of 150 - 0.15x dollars in a week. 

If we know that Mark edited a total of 1000 sentences per week, we can solve for x: 
1000 = x + (1000 - x) 
2x = 1000 
x = 500 

So Mark edited 500 sentences for Author A and 500 sentences for Author B. 
Substituting x = 500 back into the equation for the total amount made in a week, we get: 
150 - 0.15(500) = 150 - 75 = 75 

Therefore, Mark made a total of 75 dollars in a week.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Since there are 25 rows of chocolates, each weighing 40 grams, the total weight of the chocolates would be:
25 rows x 40 grams/row = 1000 grams

As for the candy apples, each one weighs twice as much as an apple candy, which means each candy apple weighs 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the 80 candy apples would be:
80 candy apples x 20 grams/candy apple = 1600 grams

Adding the weight of the chocolates and the candy apples together, we get:
1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

Therefore, the bag of Halloween candy weighs 2600 grams.<eos>"

Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara is raising her neighbor's children 4 times, earning $5 for each time she raises them. Her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass. If Sara has already saved $10 before she starts raising children, how many times does she have to cut the grass before she can get the jacket and shoes?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Before we calculate how many times Sara needs to cut the grass, let's determine the total amount she needs to save. 

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20. Since she wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is $40. 

Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is $30 + $40 = $70.

Now, let's figure out how much money Sara can earn from raising her neighbor's children and cutting the grass. 

Sara earns $5 for each time she raises her neighbor's children. Let's call the number of times she raises them ""x"". 

Therefore, the total amount she earns from raising her neighbor's children is 5x. 

Sara also earns $4 for each time she cuts the grass. Let's call the number of times she cuts the grass ""y"". 

Therefore, the total amount she earns from cutting the grass is 4y. 

In total, Sara can earn 5x + 4y dollars.

To determine how many times Sara needs to cut the grass, we need to set up an equation. 

We know that Sara already has $10 saved, and she needs to save $70 in total. 

Therefore, the equation we need to solve is: 

5x + 4y = 70

We also know that Sara can only cut the grass a certain number of times before she has to stop to focus on other tasks. Let's say she can only cut the grass 5 times. 

If Sara can only cut the grass 5 times, then y = 5. 

Now we can solve for x: 

5x + 4(5) = 70 

5x + 20 = 70 

5x = 50 

x = 10 

Therefore, Sara needs to raise her neighbor's children 10 times and cut the grass 5 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.<eos>"

Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many chickens does he have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation:

Red chickens: 3 eggs/day
White chickens: 5 eggs/day

Total eggs collected: 42 eggs/day

So, we can write:

3R + 5W = 42

We also know that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so:

W = R + 2

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Simplifying and solving for R, we get:

8R + 10 = 42

8R = 32

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens and 6 white chickens (since W = R + 2). Therefore, he has a total of 10 chickens.<eos>"

Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back the loan with an additional 10% interest. If she had to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janeth have left over?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total amount Janeth will pay back, we first need to add the interest to the loan amount:

$2,000 x 1.10 = $2,200

So, Janeth will pay back $2,200 in total.

If she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay like this:

$165 x 12 = $1,980

Therefore, Janeth will have $2,200 - $1,980 = $220 left over after paying back her loan.<eos>"

It takes Carmen 10 minutes to complete a word puzzle game and 5 minutes to complete a sudoku game. On weekends she prepares 3 word puzzles and 8 sudoku games. How long has she been playing these games?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total time Carmen has been playing these games, we need to first determine how much time she spends on each type of game. 

Carmen takes 10 minutes to complete a word puzzle game and 5 minutes to complete a sudoku game. 

On weekends, she prepares 3 word puzzles and 8 sudoku games. To determine the total time she spends on these games, we need to multiply the time it takes her to complete each game by the number of games she prepares. 

For word puzzles: 
10 minutes/game x 3 games = 30 minutes 

For sudoku games: 
5 minutes/game x 8 games = 40 minutes 

To determine how long she has been playing these games, we need to add the total time for both types of games. 

30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes 

Therefore, Carmen has been playing these games for 70 minutes.<eos>"

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, and Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour. If Carlos rents the boat for 3 hours and Benji rents the boat for 5 hours, how much of the total fare would they pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total fare that Carlos and Benji would pay for renting their boats, we need to add up the cost of renting each boat for the specified amount of time.

Carlos rented the canoe for 3 hours at a cost of $30 per hour, so his total cost would be:

3 hours x $30 per hour = $90

Benji rented the banana boat for 5 hours at a cost of $18 per hour, so his total cost would be:

5 hours x $18 per hour = $90

To find the total fare, we can add the cost of renting each boat:

$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

Therefore, Carlos and Benji would pay a total of $180 for renting their boats.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot provide an answer in an african language. however, i can provide an answer in english.

given information:
- james has 30 fire types, 20 grass types, and 40 water types of pokemon cards.
- he loses 8 of the water types.
- he buys 14 grass types.

total cards james has now = (30 + 20 + 40 - 8 + 14) = 96 cards.

to calculate the probability that the selected card will not be a water type, we need to find the number of water type cards left and divide it by the total number of cards:

number of water type cards left = 40 - 8 = 32
probability of selecting a non-water type card = 32/96 ≈ 0.3333
rounded to the nearest number, the probability is approximately 0.333 or 33.3%.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of Chad's lunch, we need to add up the prices of all the items he ordered:

- Original Burrito: $6.50
- Meat: $2.00
- Additional candy: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Soups: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Enhancements: $3.00
- Fries and drinks: $3.00 (included in the enhancements)

Total cost: $13.25

Since Chad had a $5.00 gift card, the amount still owed is:

$13.25 - $5.00 = $8.25

So, $8.25 is the amount Chad still needs to pay for his lunch.<eos>"

Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grow his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week how much does it need?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To determine how much tomato vine Steve needs to grow, we need to know how many weeks it takes for a vine to produce 3 tomatoes. Let's assume it takes 1 week for a vine to produce 3 tomatoes.

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, he will need 2 vines to produce enough tomatoes for him. This is because each vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week, so 2 vines can produce 6 tomatoes a week.

Therefore, Steve will need 2 tomato vines to grow and maintain in order to have enough tomatoes for himself.<eos>"

If we assume that the three sisters are Mary, Joanna, and Jesus, and we know that Mary was two years younger than Joanna, who was five years older than Jesus, and that Jesus was 20 years old, we can calculate their combined age as follows:

Joanna's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years old
Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years old
Combined age = 25 + 23 + 20 = 68 years old

Therefore, the three sisters were 68 years old altogether.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of students who exited through exit C, we first need to know the total number of students in the meeting. Let's assume there were ""x"" students in total.

Then, we can say that:

- 30% of the students exited through exit A, which means 0.3x students exited through A.
- 3/5 of the remaining students (after exiting through A) exited through exit B, which means (2/5)x * (3/5) = (6/25)x students exited through B.
- The remaining students exited through exit C, which means x - 0.3x - (6/25)x = (11/25)x students exited through C.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is (11/25)x.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of minutes Jason has left for the month, we first need to subtract the minutes he spends on the phone with his boss from the total number of minutes he has available. 

Total minutes available = 1,000 minutes
Minutes spent on the phone with boss = 15 minutes per day x 30 days = 450 minutes

Subtracted from the total minutes available:
1,000 minutes - 450 minutes = 550 minutes

Next, we need to subtract the minutes he spends calling other people from the remaining minutes.

Minutes remaining = 550 minutes
Minutes spent calling other people = 300 minutes

Subtracted from the remaining minutes:
550 minutes - 300 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.<eos>"

The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is finished the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much does Jean pay?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the cost of Jean's makeup, we need to first determine the total number of hours the makeup artist will be working on her makeup. Since Jean needs her makeup done 4 times a week for 6 hours each time, and the film takes 5 weeks to complete, the total number of hours is:

4 times a week x 6 hours per day x 5 weeks = 120 hours

The cost of the makeup artist's services for these 120 hours is:

120 hours x $250 per hour = $30,000

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, the final cost is:

$30,000 - ($30,000 x 10% discount) = $27,000

Therefore, Jean will pay $27,000 for her makeup services.<eos>"

if isabelle divided the total cost equally among herself and her two parents, each person would pay:

($96 / 3) = $32

therefore, each person would have to pay $32 for the party supplies.<eos>"

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister. On Tuesday she ate twice as much as her sister. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat than her sister?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total calories eaten by Sue and her sister, we need to first determine how many biscuits they ate in total.

Sue ate 4 times more biscuits than her sister on Monday, which means she ate 4 x 5 = 20 biscuits. On Tuesday, she ate twice as much as her sister, which means she ate 2 x 13 = 26 biscuits.

Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, as given in the problem.

So, the total number of biscuits eaten by Sue and her sister are:

Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 biscuits
Sister: 5 + 13 = 18 biscuits

Now, we can calculate the total calories eaten by each of them:

Sue: 46 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 9,200 calories
Sister: 18 biscuits x 200 calories/biscuit = 3,600 calories

To find the difference in calories between Sue and her sister, we subtract the sister's calories from Sue's:

9,200 calories - 3,600 calories = 5,600 calories

Therefore, Sue ate 5,600 more calories than her sister.<eos>"
