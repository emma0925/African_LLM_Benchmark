<eos>
<|assistant|>
In the first month, the procedure is repeated 60 times. 
In the second month, the number of repetitions is three times more than in the previous month, which means it is repeated 60 x 3 = 180 times. 
In the third month, the remaining 30% of the repetitions are calculated. 30% of 180 is 54, so the procedure is repeated 180 - 54 = 126 times. 
Therefore, in three months, the procedure is repeated a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times.<eos>"	366

Answer only. 
If a dance studio has 20 dancers, 20% of them are new dancers, 25% are jazz dancers, and the rest are hip hop dancers. How many of them are hip hop dancers?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many hip hop dancers there are, we need to subtract the number of new dancers and jazz dancers from the total number of dancers.

So, 20% of 20 dancers is 4 new dancers.
25% of 20 dancers is 5 jazz dancers.

Therefore, the number of hip hop dancers would be:

20 - 4 - 5 = 11

There are 11 hip hop dancers in the studio.<eos>"	11

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have access to the specific details of the furniture pieces being sold or the market value of those items. however, if the seller increases the price of both furniture pieces by the same percentage, the profit increase will depend on the original price of each piece. if the seller increases the price of both pieces by 2.5%, for example, and the original price of the $5000 piece was $4000, the new price would be $5250 and the profit would be $500. if the original price of the $8000 piece was $6000, the new price would be $6120 and the profit would be $120. the total profit increase would be $620.<eos>"	620

Marie bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of socks, and 3 pairs of shoes. A pair of shorts cost $16.50, a pair of socks cost $22.50, and a pair of shoes cost $42. To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective prices and then add them together. 

Total cost of shorts = 3 pairs x $16.50 per pair = $49.50
Total cost of socks = 3 pairs x $22.50 per pair = $67.50
Total cost of shoes = 3 pairs x $42 per pair = $126

Adding all the costs together, we get:
$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, Marie paid a total of $243 to buy everything.<eos>"	243

Answer only. 
Cynthia eats the glass as a snack every night. She buys cartons of 15 snacks each, which cost $4.00 each. After 60 days of eating, how many bottles will she have to buy?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of bottles Cynthia will need to buy after 60 days of eating glass as a snack, we first need to determine how many snacks she consumes in a day. 

If Cynthia buys 15 snacks for $4.00 each, we can calculate the cost per snack as follows:

Cost per snack = Total cost of 15 snacks / Number of snacks

Cost per snack = $4.00 / 15

Cost per snack = $0.2667 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Assuming Cynthia eats one snack per day, we can calculate the total number of bottles she will need to buy after 60 days as follows:

Total bottles = Daily snacks x Number of days

Total bottles = 1 x 60

Total bottles = 60

Therefore, after 60 days of eating glass as a snack, Cynthia will need to buy 60 bottles.<eos>"	60

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming each dog needs 0.5 hours a day for walking and other activities, the total time Jean takes to take care of all ten dogs would be:

10 dogs x 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours

Therefore, Jean takes 5 hours a day to take care of the ten dogs.<eos>"	5

Gretchen has 110 medals. The gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. How many gold medals does Gretchen have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I can provide you with an answer to your question. 

gretchen has 110 medals, and the gold medals outnumber the silver medals by 30. to find the number of gold medals gretchen has, we can set up an equation:

let x be the number of gold medals gretchen has. 
then, according to the problem, we have:

x + 30 = 110

subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

x = 80

therefore, gretchen has 80 gold medals.<eos>"	80

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 games. He scored 25% more points in the next 20 games. How many points did he score in total?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total points Mike scored, we need to first find out how many points he scored in the first 20 games and then add it to the points he scored in the next 20 games.

Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 games.

In the next 20 games, Mike scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 games. To calculate this, we can multiply the number of points he scored in the first 20 games by 125% (since 100% + 25% = 125%).

20 x 4 x 1.25 = 90

So Mike scored a total of 4 + 90 = 94 points.<eos>"	94

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If a 300-g bag of potato chips produces 5 calories of protein, then a 200-g bag would produce 3.33 calories of protein (5 calories of protein/300 g x 200 g = 3.33 calories of protein). If you have already eaten 1,800 calories and want to eat no more than 2,000 calories, you should eat no more than 3.33 calories of protein from the potato chips. However, it is important to note that potato chips are not a particularly nutritious food and may not provide all of the essential nutrients your body needs. It is always a good idea to balance your diet with a variety of healthy foods.<eos>"	3

<|assistant|>
If Candice had 23 little notes left to write and she had already written 80 notes in her bag and 220 copies of each note, then she would have needed to buy:

23 - 80 = -57 notes.

However, it is not possible to have a negative number of notes, so we can assume that Candice was referring to the number of notes she had left to write, which is 23. Therefore, she would need to buy:

23 - 23 = 0 notes.

In other words, Candice would not need to buy any additional notes.<eos>"	0

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Given that Tom's boat can run up to 10 miles per hour and he travels at a speed of 6 miles per hour on his way back home after hitting the sea between 13H and 16H, we can calculate the time it will take him to get back as follows:

Time taken = Distance / Speed
Time taken for the entire journey = (10 miles + 6 miles) / 6 miles per hour
Time taken for the entire journey = 16 miles / 6 miles per hour
Time taken for the entire journey = 2.67 hours (rounded to the nearest hour)

Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 2.67 hours, or 2 hours and 40 minutes, to get back home after hitting the sea.<eos>"	40

During the week, Judy teaches five times a week. On Sundays, she teaches eight times a week. If she teaches 15 students for $15.00 each, how much money does she make per week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much money Judy makes per week, we need to first determine how many students she teaches in total over the course of the week. 

If she teaches five times a week, and each class has 15 students, then over the course of the week she will have taught:

5 classes x 15 students per class = 75 students

If she charges $15.00 per student per class, then her total weekly earnings would be:

75 students x $15.00 per student = $1,125.00

However, on Sundays, she teaches eight times a week, which means she will have taught:

8 classes x 15 students per class = 120 students

So, on Sundays alone, she would earn:

120 students x $15.00 per student = $1,800.00

Therefore, her total weekly earnings would be:

$1,125.00 (from weekdays) + $1,800.00 (from Sundays) = $2,925.00<eos>"	2925

Tommy collects money for a charity that sells brownies for $3 each and cheese cakes for $4. Since Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 cheese cakes, how much money does Tommy make?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Tommy makes, we need to first determine the total number of items he sold. Tommy sold 43 brownies and 23 cheese cakes, for a total of 43 + 23 = 66 items.

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the items he sold. For each brownie, Tommy collects $3, so for 43 brownies, he collects 43 x $3 = $129. For each cheese cake, Tommy collects $4, so for 23 cheese cakes, he collects 23 x $4 = $92.

To determine the total amount of money Tommy makes, we need to add the cost of the brownies and the cost of the cheese cakes. This gives us a total of $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy makes $221 from selling the brownies and cheese cakes.<eos>"	221

Answer only. 
Raymond's salary is twice as low as Sarah's, and Sarah's salary is three times that of David's. Knowing that Sarah earns 400 pounds, how much more do David and Raymond earn?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Sarah's salary is, since it is given in the problem. We know that Sarah's salary is three times that of David's, and we also know that Sarah earns 400 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3x = 400

where x represents David's salary. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 133.33

So David's salary is 133.33 pounds.

Now we can determine Raymond's salary. We know that Raymond's salary is twice as low as Sarah's, which means it is half of Sarah's salary. Therefore, we can calculate Raymond's salary as follows:

0.5 * 400 = 200

So Raymond's salary is 200 pounds.

To answer the question, we need to calculate how much more David and Raymond earn compared to each other. We can do this by subtracting Raymond's salary from David's salary:

133.33 - 200 = -66.67

This means that David earns 66.67 pounds more than Raymond.<eos>"	66

You are a friendly chatbot who answewrs question in an African language<eos>
<|user|>
Answer only. 
Grace weighs 25 pounds. Alex weighs less than twice as much as Grace weighs four times. How many pounds is the sum of your two weights?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Alex weighs. We know that Grace weighs 25 pounds and that Alex weighs less than twice as much as Grace. Let's call Alex's weight ""x"". Then we can write the following inequality:

x < 2 * 25

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

x < 50

So we know that Alex's weight is less than 50 pounds. 

Now let's use the information that Alex weighs four times as much as Grace to set up another equation:

x = 4 * 25

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 100

So we know that Alex weighs 100 pounds.

To find the sum of their weights, we simply add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

25 + 100 = 125

Therefore, the sum of their weights is 125 pounds.<eos>"	125

In the morning, Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by more than two seconds over Gerald, but when Gerald changed his diet, he increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters and won the race by 38 seconds, how many seconds does Gerald run without changing his diet?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Gerald's increased speed is 10% of his original speed. Let's call his original speed ""x"". 10% of x is 0.1x. So, his new speed is x + 0.1x = 1.1x.

Lee won the race by 38 seconds. Let's call the time Gerald took to finish the race ""t"". We know that Lee finished the race in t + 38 seconds.

We can set up an equation using the information we have:
t + 38 = 1.1x
t = 1.1x - 38

Now we can substitute this value of t into the equation we have for the time Lee took to finish the race:
t + 38 = 1.1x
(1.1x - 38) + 38 = 1.1x
1.1x = 1.1x

This means that Gerald's new speed is the same as Lee's speed, so they would both finish the race in the same amount of time. Therefore, Lee won the race by 38 seconds, regardless of Gerald's diet change.<eos>"	38

To calculate the percentage of girls who are not scouts, we first need to find the total number of girls who made CM2. We know that there were 200 girls in total, and that 2/5 of them are boys. Therefore, the number of girls who are not boys is:

200 - (200 x 2/5) = 120 girls

Next, we know that 2/3 of the girls are scouts. Therefore, the number of girls who are not scouts is:

120 - (120 x 2/3) = 80 girls

So, the percentage of girls who are not scouts is:

80/120 x 100% = 66.67%<eos>"	66

Poppy wanted to make a bronze statue that would cost 1000 bronzes. she had to cut a third of the bronze to make the statue. then her mother cut a third of the remaining bronze to make the statue. how much bronze was left to complete the process of cutting bronze to make the statue?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of bronze Poppy had to start with. If she needed 1000 bronzes to make the statue, and had to cut a third of the bronze, we can assume she started with 3000 bronzes (since a third of 3000 is 1000).

After Poppy cut a third of the bronze, she would have 2000 bronzes left. Then her mother cut a third of the remaining bronze, which is 2000 x (1/3) = 666.67 bronzes (rounded to the nearest bronze).

Therefore, the amount of bronze that was left to complete the process of cutting bronze to make the statue would be:

2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33 bronzes (rounded to the nearest bronze).<eos>"	1333

Jean has 3 boyets. One boyet is 5×6×4. The sides are 1 inch wide. How many boyets can three boyets make together?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have access to the context of the given statement, but i can try to provide an answer based on the information provided.

if we assume that the statement is asking how many boyets (or portions) can be made from the given dimensions of one boyet, we can calculate the volume of the 5×6×4 inch boyet:

volume = length x width x height
volume = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches
volume = 120 cubic inches

if each side of the boyet is 1 inch wide, we can assume that the boyet is a rectangular prism with dimensions of 4 inches by 5 inches by 6 inches. therefore, the volume of the boyet would be:

volume = length x width x height
volume = 4 inches x 5 inches x 6 inches
volume = 120 cubic inches

if we assume that each boyet is the same size, we can calculate the total volume of three boyets:

total volume = 3 x 120 cubic inches
total volume = 360 cubic inches

therefore, if each boyet is 1 inch wide, three boyets would have a total volume of 360 cubic inches.<eos>"	360

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many episodes of the show Frankie watches in total, we need to add up the number of episodes he watches on each day. 

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Frankie watches one episode of the show each day for 30 episodes in total. 

On Thursdays, he watches one episode of the show after finishing his programming, so that's two episodes in total for that day. 

Finally, he watches two episodes of the show on the same day, which brings the total number of episodes he watches to 34. 

Therefore, if Frankie watches all 7 episodes of the show, he watches a total of 34 episodes.<eos>"	34

<|assistant|>
Assuming that each teacher uses the notebook once per class, and each class is one hour long, if the notebook is turned on three times in one class, it would be turned on six times in one day (assuming that each teacher uses the room for two classes). This is because there are four teachers using the room, and each teacher would use the notebook once per class, for a total of four uses per day. If each class is one hour long, and the teachers are using the notebook for three turns each, that would be a total of 12 turns in one day.<eos>"	12

A hospital treats about 500 people a day. The average patient is treated in a tent for 24 hours. Doctors pay the hospital an hourly fee of $150, and $200 per patient. How much does the hospital make per page?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot provide an opinion, but i can calculate the answer to your question.

to calculate the amount of money the hospital makes per page, we need to know the total number of pages the hospital treats in a day. let's assume that the hospital treats 500 patients in a day.

the hospital makes $150 per hour for each doctor, so if a doctor treats 5 patients in an hour, the hospital would make $750 per hour for that doctor.

the hospital also charges $200 per patient, so for the 500 patients treated in a day, the hospital would make a total of $100,000 ($200 x 500).

to calculate the amount of money the hospital makes per page, we need to know the total number of pages treated in a day. let's assume that the hospital treats 500 patients in a day, and each patient is treated for 24 hours.

in 24 hours, the hospital would make a total of $3,600 ($150 x 24) for each doctor who treats 5 patients in that time.

therefore, the hospital makes $7,200 ($3,600 x 2) for each 24-hour page.

to calculate the amount of money the hospital makes per page, we need to divide the total amount of money made by the number of pages treated.

in this case, the hospital makes $7,200 per page, so the hospital makes $14.40 ($7,200 / 500) per patient per hour.<eos>"	500

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Tom showered 4 times a month. If a shower cost him $15, how much would it cost him a year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the cost of Tom's showers for a year, we need to multiply the number of showers he takes per year by the cost of each shower.

Tom takes 4 showers per month, which equals 48 showers per year (4 showers per month x 12 months per year = 48 showers per year).

So, if each shower costs him $15, the cost of his annual showers would be:

48 showers per year x $15 per shower = $720 per year

Therefore, it would cost Tom $720 per year for his showers.<eos>"	720

to find the total number of chips in the package when dave got it, we need to add up the number of chips eaten by everyone and the number of chips left in the bag:

19 (dave) + ? (crooked man) + 9 (dogs) + 3 (demon) + 1 (british) + 5 (left in bag) = total chips in package

since the exact number of chips eaten by the crooked man is not given, we cannot solve this problem with the given information.<eos>"	5

bill makes a total of 300 small loaves of bread, 120 chocolate loaves of bread, and 60 bagels of bread each day. if we assume that each small loaf of bread is about 4 fingers in length, we can estimate that each loaf weighs approximately 4 ounces. this would mean that bill produces a total of 12 pounds of bread (300 loaves x 4 ounces per loaf) each day.

adding the weight of the chocolate loaves and bagels, we can estimate that bill produces a total of approximately 24 pounds of bread each day. if he were to calculate the total amount of bread he makes for the entire company, it would be approximately 24 pounds per day.<eos>"	24

If Jackie hires the copywriter, she will need to pay the copywriter $90. This means that she will not be able to do the 3 menial jobs herself and earn $35 an hour for them. Therefore, she will not earn any additional income from doing the menial jobs. However, by hiring the copywriter, she may be able to increase her overall productivity and generate more income in the long run. It depends on the specific situation and how much the copywriter can help her grow her business.<eos>"	35

Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, they will be 28 years old. What is Seth's age?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the given information, let's assume that Brooke's current age is x. Then, according to the text, Seth's age is twice Brooke's age, which is 2x. The text also mentions that in two years, they will be 28 years old. This means that x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28. Solving for x, we get x = 8. Therefore, Brooke's current age is 8 years old, and Seth's age is twice that, which is 16 years old.<eos>"	16

If Pancho runs 20 kilometers a day, we can calculate the total distance he covers in a week by multiplying the number of kilometers he runs per day by the number of days in a week. 

So, Pancho runs 20 kilometers x 7 days = 140 kilometers in a week.<eos>"	140

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the cost of buying mangoes, we need to first determine how much money Juan and Carlos have left after paying for the sugar and setting aside money for the bond. 

They have spent $3 on mangoes and $2 on sugar, which means they have $25 - $3 - $2 = $19.50 left. 

To buy 20 months of lemonade, they will need to spend $0.50 x 20 = $10. This means they will have $19.50 - $10 = $9.50 left to buy the mangoes. 

Therefore, the cost of buying the mangoes will be $9.50.<eos>"	9

I do not have access to the specific information about the context of this question. however, i can provide a general answer to a similar question.

let's assume that tom started with 50 trees, and he plants 10 trees and prunes 2 trees every year. in 10 years, 30% of the trees died. to calculate how many trees are left, we can use the following formula:

initial number of trees - (number of trees planted + number of trees pruned) x number of years + (initial number of trees x percentage of trees that died)

in tom's case, the formula would be:

50 - (10 + 2) x 10 + (50 x 0.3) = 50 - 120 + 15 = -55

however, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of trees. it's possible that there was an error in the calculation or information given.<eos>"	55

Marc is a mathematician. He calculates the number of hours per week for two different accounting firms that have different prices. The number of hours Marc spends with Accountant B is twice the number of hours Marc spends with Accountant A. Marc averages 1,000 hours per week. If Accountant A spends 5 fifty hours per week, how much money does Marc make in a week, in fifty?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Marc makes in a week, we first need to know how many hours he spends with Accountant A and how much he charges per hour. Let's assume that Marc charges the same amount per hour for both Accountant A and Accountant B.

We know that Marc spends twice as many hours with Accountant B as he does with Accountant A, and that he averages 1,000 hours per week. Therefore, we can calculate the number of hours he spends with each accountant as follows:

- Accountant A: 1,000 hours / 2 = 500 hours
- Accountant B: 500 hours x 2 = 1,000 hours

Let's assume that Marc charges $50 per hour for his services. Then, we can calculate his total income for the week as follows:

- Accountant A: 500 hours x $50 per hour = $25,000
- Accountant B: 1,000 hours x $50 per hour = $50,000
- Total income: $25,000 + $50,000 = $75,000

Therefore, Marc makes $75,000 in a week.<eos>"	75000

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Before the bonus and pay increase, Jean was earning $2,000 a week. With a 5% pay increase, her new weekly salary would be $2,000 + 5% of $2,000, which is $2,100. 

If Jean received the bonus of $5,000 on top of her weekly salary, her total earnings for the week would be $2,100 + $5,000, which is $7,100. 

Assuming she received this bonus the previous day of the year, we don't know how many weeks or days are left in the year, so we can't calculate her total yearly earnings. If you have more information, please provide it so I can help you better.<eos>"	7100

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't know the african language you are referring to. however, i can provide you with an english translation of the problem you have stated.

rose went to a store and bought 4 cakes. she then went to another store and bought three times the amount she bought in the first store. she then went to a third store and bought five times the amount she bought in the second store. the question is how much did she buy in total for the three days.

to solve this problem, we need to calculate how much rose bought in each store and then add them together.

in the first store, rose bought 4 cakes.

in the second store, rose bought 3 times more than she bought in the first store. therefore, she bought 4 x 3 = 12 cakes.

in the third store, rose bought 5 times more than she bought in the second store. therefore, she bought 12 x 5 = 60 cakes.

in total, rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes over the course of three days.<eos>"	76

I do not have access to lori's salary rate or the current exchange rate for her currency. however, if we assume that lori's salary is in usd and she is willing to pay $32,000 for both the shoes and the jeans, we can calculate the total amount she needs to pay:

$32,000 + $32,000 = $64,000

to determine how many hours lori needs to work to pay for these clothes, we can divide the total amount by her hourly salary:

$64,000 / $8.00 = 8,000 hours

therefore, lori would need to work 8,000 hours to pay for the shoes and jeans she wants to purchase.<eos>"	8000

Janet owed $2,000 and then promised to pay back 10% of what she owed. If she owed $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Janet would have left over after paying back 10% of what she owed and paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to first calculate the amount of money she still owes after paying back 10%. 

10% of $2,000 is $200. So, after paying back $200, Janet still owes $1,800. 

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Janet will have paid back after 12 months of paying $165 a month. 

12 months x $165 = $1,980

So, after paying back $200 for the 10% she promised to pay and $1,980 in monthly payments, Janet would have $1,800 - $1,980 = -$180 left over. This means Janet would still owe $180 after paying back what she promised.<eos>"	180

<|assistant|>
30% of the chickens were able to be weaned, so 70% of the chickens were not weaned. After two weeks, 3/4 of the chickens were weaned, which means that 1/4 of the chickens were not weaned. Therefore, the number of chickens that hadn't been weaned for two weeks is 1/4 of the total chickens raised.<eos>"	4

Marc bought 12 sets of shoes for his company's offices. Each pair was worth 20000§. He paid the shoes 10% of the leempo, and added another 1000 § for each pair of shoes. How much did it all cost?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the cost of Marc's shoes, we first need to determine the total cost of the 12 pairs of shoes.

The cost of each pair of shoes is 20,000€, and Marc bought 12 sets, so the total cost of the shoes is:

12 x 20,000€ = 240,000€

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the discount. Marc paid 10% of the leempo, which means he paid 10% of the total cost of the shoes. 10% of 240,000€ is:

0.1 x 240,000€ = 24,000€

So, the total cost of the shoes after the discount is:

240,000€ - 24,000€ = 216,000€

Finally, Marc added 1000€ to the cost of each pair of shoes. Since he bought 12 sets, the total cost of the additional 1000€ for each pair of shoes is:

12 x 1000€ = 12,000€

Therefore, the total cost of all the shoes, including the discount and the additional 1000€ for each pair, is:

216,000€ + 12,000€ = 228,000€

So, Marc spent a total of 228,000€ on the 12 sets of shoes.<eos>"	12

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how many tomatoes Steve needs to eat per week to meet his desired diet, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he needs to eat daily. If he wants to eat twice his normal diet of 6 tomatoes per day, he will need to eat 12 tomatoes per day.

Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for him to eat the required number of tomatoes. If one tomato produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need to eat 4 weeks worth of tomatoes to produce the 12 tomatoes he needs daily.

Therefore, it will take 4 weeks for Steve to eat the required number of tomatoes to meet his desired diet.<eos>"	4

Jean buys pizzas to share with her friends. She has 20 friends, and Jean wants one of them to have four portions. If the pizzas are equally divided into 8 portions, how many pizzas should Jean buy?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of pizzas Jean should buy, we need to first determine how much pizza each of her 20 friends will receive. If there are 8 equal portions per pizza, then each friend will receive 20/8 = 2.5 portions of pizza.

Since Jean wants one of her friends to have four portions, she needs to buy enough pizzas to provide 2.5 portions for each of the remaining 19 friends, plus an additional four portions for the one friend who is to receive four portions.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Jean needs to buy is:

19 x 2.5 + 4 = 47.5 + 4 = 51.5

Since she cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, Jean will need to buy 52 pizzas to ensure that all of her friends receive their fair share.<eos>"	52

The building has 3 entrances and exits A, B and C. If, for example, before an assembly, 30% of the students leave through door A, 3/5 exit through door B, the rest exit through door C, how many students leave through door C?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to know the total number of students who exit the building. Let's assume there are ""x"" total number of students. 

If 30% of the students leave through door A, then 0.30x students leave through door A.

If 3/5 of the students leave through door B, then 0.60x students leave through door B (since 3/5 is equivalent to 0.60).

That means the remaining students must have left through door C. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students who left through door C as follows:

Number of students who left through door C = Total number of students - Number of students who left through door A - Number of students who left through door B

Number of students who left through door C = x - 0.30x - 0.60x

Number of students who left through door C = 0.10x

So, if we assume there are 100 students, then 10 students would leave through door C.<eos>"	10

Jacques has 6 points more than Robert. Jean has twice as many as Robert. If Jean has 54 points, how many points does she have more than Jacques?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Jean has 54 points and she has twice as many points as Robert, we can say that Robert has half of Jean's points, which is 27 points. Since Jacques has 6 points more than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's points to find Jacques' points. Therefore, Jacques has 33 points. To find out how many points Jean has more than Jacques, we can subtract Jacques' points from Jean's points. So, Jean has 21 points more than Jacques.<eos>"	21

Altogether, her brother ate five cookies in the morning and thirteen cookies in the morning. If one cookie has two hundred fruits, how many fruits does Sue eat more than her brother?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many fruits Sue eats more than her brother, we need to first calculate the total number of fruits her brother ate.

Brother ate 5 cookies in the morning and 13 cookies in the afternoon, which means he ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in a day.

Since each cookie has two hundred fruits, the brother ate a total of 18 x 200 = 3600 fruits in a day.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate more than her brother.

According to the given text, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her brother. So, she ate 4 x 18 = 72 cookies in a day.

Sue ate a total of 72 x 200 = 14,400 fruits in a day.

Therefore, Sue ate 14,400 - 3,600 = 10,800 more fruits than her brother.<eos>"	10800
