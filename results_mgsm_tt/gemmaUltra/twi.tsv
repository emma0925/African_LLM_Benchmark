Every day, Wendi gives her chickens three cups of chicken food, consisting of chickens, elephants and vegetables to give them strength. She gives the food to the chickens three times. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of food, in the afternoon, she gives the chickens another 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to give the chickens at the last meal of the day if the total number of Wendi chickens is 20?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of food Wendi needs to give her chickens at the last meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of food she gives her chickens in a day. 

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of food in the morning and another 25 cups of food in the afternoon, which means she has already given them a total of 40 cups of food in a day. 

Since she has 20 chickens, we can divide the total cups of food by the number of chickens to get the amount of food each chicken should receive. 

40 cups of food / 20 chickens = 2 cups of food per chicken 

Therefore, Wendi needs to give each chicken 2 cups of food at the last meal of the day. 

Since she has 20 chickens, she will need to give them a total of:

2 cups of food per chicken x 20 chickens = 40 cups of food 

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 40 cups of food at the last meal of the day.<eos>"

An app is downloaded from a user's mobile device 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number in the first month, and 30% less in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in all three months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
In the first month, the app was downloaded 60 times.
In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the number in the first month, which means 3 x 60 = 180 downloads.
In the third month, the number of downloads was 30% less than the second month, which means 180 - (180 x 0.3) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.
Therefore, the total number of downloads in all three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times.<eos>"

In a dance class of 20 students, twenty percent are enrolled in the dance class, the other fifty percent are enrolled in the Jazz class, and the rest are enrolled in the hip-hop class. What percentage are enrolled in the hip-hop class?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find the percentage of students enrolled in the hip-hop class, we need to subtract the percentage of students enrolled in the dance and jazz classes from 100%. 

Therefore, 100% - 20% (dance) - 50% (jazz) = 30% of the students are enrolled in the hip-hop class. 

So, 30% of the 20 students in the dance class are enrolled in the hip-hop class.<eos>"

Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 an hour to train athletes. If she works fifty weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her salary for the entire year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate Jill's salary for the entire year, we need to first determine the total number of hours she works as a teacher and as a coach. 

As a teacher, Jill works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, which equals a total of 1750 hours. 

As a coach, Jill works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, which equals a total of 750 hours. 

To determine her total salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works in each capacity by her hourly rate and then add the two totals together. 

For teaching, Jill's salary would be 1750 hours x $20/hour = $35,000. 

For coaching, Jill's salary would be 750 hours x $30/hour = $22,500. 

Adding these two salaries together gives us a total of $57,500 for the year.<eos>"

Marrisa walked up a hill at twelve miles per hour. She walked the first four miles in one hour, and walked the next two miles in one hour. If she wanted to run at four miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Marissa walked the first four miles in one hour and the next two miles in one hour, her average speed for the first six miles is 3 miles per hour. To catch up to her original speed of 12 miles per hour, she would need to walk the remaining six miles at a speed of 9 miles per hour. Therefore, she would need to increase her speed by 6 miles per hour to reach her desired speed of 12 miles per hour.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
You have a total of 10 liters of water, and you spilled 1 liter of water, leaving you with 9 liters of water. To add 15 liters of water, you will need a total of 24 liters of water. However, since you spilled 1 liter, you only have 23 liters of water left to add. To find out how much water is left in the other 24 liters, you need to subtract the 15 liters you added from the 24 liters you have left, which gives you 9 liters of water. Therefore, you have a total of 9 liters of water left in the other 24 liters.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I cannot perform calculations. however, i can help you understand the problem. 

first, we need to calculate mike's average score in the first 20 minutes. since he scored 4 points, his average score for the first half of the game is 4 points per 20 minutes. 

in the second half of the game, mike scored 50% more points than his average. to calculate this, we can multiply his average score by 1.5. 

4 * 1.5 = 6

Richard lives in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, three-quarters of which are occupied. How many rooms are occupied in the building?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of occupied rooms in the building, we first need to determine the total number of rooms in the building. Since there are 8 rooms per floor and 15 floors, the total number of rooms in the building is 8 x 15 = 120 rooms.

Next, we need to determine the number of occupied rooms. We know that three-quarters of the rooms are occupied, so we can calculate the number of occupied rooms as follows:

3/4 x 120 = 90 occupied rooms

Therefore, there are 90 occupied rooms in the building.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Lloyd owns an egg farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day and sell two dozen eggs for $2. How much money does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the amount of money Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first determine how many dozen eggs Lloyd sells in a day. Since his chickens lay 252 eggs a day and he sells two dozen eggs for $2, we can assume that he sells 10 dozen eggs (252 eggs / 24 eggs per dozen = 10 dozen) in a day.

To calculate the amount of money he makes on eggs per week, we need to multiply the number of dozen eggs he sells in a day by the number of days in a week and the price per dozen. So, Lloyd makes:

10 dozen eggs per day x 7 days per week x $2 per dozen = $140 per week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $140 per week from selling his eggs.<eos>"

If you add the box and the empty box, the total weight is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding the capacity of the bridge?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the bridge by dividing the bridge's capacity by the weight of each box. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding its capacity is:

5000 pounds ÷ 15 pounds per box = 333.33 boxes

However, since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the bridge is:

333 boxes<eos>"

A raspberry bush has six rows of 20 berries and 67 individual berries scattered throughout the bush. How many raspberries are there?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total number of raspberries in the bush, you need to add the number of berries in each row and the scattered berries. 

Number of berries in each row = 6 rows x 20 berries per row = 120 berries

Total number of scattered berries = 67 berries

Add the two numbers together: 120 + 67 = 187

Therefore, there are 187 raspberries in the bush.<eos>"

<eos>

I don't have access to the current exchange rate between the film company's currency and yours, so i cannot provide you with an exact answer. however, i can give you the formula to calculate the amount he paid the film company for the entire year:

total amount paid to the film company = (amount paid for the first half of the year + amount paid for the second half of the year) x 10%

amount paid for the first half of the year = $140 x (100% - 10%) = $140 x 0.9 = $126

amount paid for the second half of the year = $140 x (100% - 10%) = $140 x 0.9 = $126

total amount paid to the film company = ($126 + $126) x 10% = $252 x 0.1 = $25.20<eos>"

The doctor's note on the tank says that the tank can hold 12 gallons of oil.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Sophia, it seems you are having some trouble with your car's fuel tank. To figure out how far you can go on each tank of fuel, you first need to know the fuel efficiency of your car. This information can be found in the car's manual or by doing some research online. Once you know the fuel efficiency, you can calculate how many miles you can travel on a full tank of gas. 

To calculate how much gas you need to put in the tank, you can subtract the amount of gas you have already put in from the total capacity of the tank. In your case, you have already cut 100 gallons of oil and need to put in 4 gallons more before filling up again. So, you would have 104 gallons of gas in the tank by the time you need to fill up again. 

To figure out how much gas you can put in the tank at one time, you need to subtract the current amount of gas in the tank from the total capacity of the tank. In your case, the doctor's note says that the tank can hold 12 gallons of oil, so you would have 92 gallons of space left in the tank to fill up. 

I hope this helps!<eos>"

To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of students at the school. We know that there are 60 men and 50 women, so the total number of students is:

60 men + 50 women = 110 students

We also know that there are 50 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we need to divide the total number of students by 50:

110 students ÷ 50 students/teacher = 2 teachers

Therefore, there are 2 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Artie can save some money by not paying the full price for the flowers she sells. If she sells marigolds for $2.74 each, petunias for $1.87 each, and begonias for $2.12 each, she can calculate the total cost of the flowers she sells by multiplying the price of each flower by the number of flowers sold. For marigolds, the total cost would be 12 x $2.74 = $32.88. For petunias, the total cost would be 9 x $1.87 = $16.83, and for begonias, the total cost would be 17 x $2.12 = $35.64. Adding all the costs together, Artie can save money by not paying the full price for the flowers she sells.<eos>"

Cecilia bought a new puppy. Following the advice of an animal health professional, the puppy should be given one cup of dog food a day for the first 180 days. And then the puppy should be given two cups of dog food for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food costs 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need in the first year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of bags of dog food needed in the first year, we need to know how much dog food the puppy will need in total for the first year. 

For the first 180 days, the puppy should be given one cup of dog food per day. This means that for the first 180 days, the puppy will need:

1 cup per day x 180 days = 180 cups of dog food

After the first 180 days, the puppy should be given two cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. This means that for the remaining 180 days of the first year, the puppy will need:

2 cups per day x 180 days = 360 cups of dog food

In total, the puppy will need 180 cups of dog food for the first 180 days and 360 cups of dog food for the remaining 180 days of the first year. 

If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, then the number of bags of dog food needed in the first year will be:

180 cups / 110 cups per bag + 360 cups / 110 cups per bag = 2 bags + 3.6 bags = approximately 6 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will need approximately 6 bags of dog food in the first year.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Christina is organizing a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest, since 1/4 of the guests are female. She invites 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that all the guests are equally likely to be female or male, Christina would need a total of 75 gift bags for all her guests. Since she has invited 16 friends, she would need:

(16 friends) x (75 gift bags per friend) = 1200 gift bags

However, since 1/4 of the guests are female, she only needs to prepare:

1200 gift bags x (1/4) = 300 gift bags for the female guests

Therefore, Christina needs to prepare 300 gift bags for her female guests. Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags would be:

300 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $600

So Christina needs to prepare 300 gift bags at a cost of $600 for her female guests.<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
Emily has 4 children named Amy, Jackson, Corey and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
From the given information, we can create the following equations:

1) Amy is 5 years older than Jackson:  Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5
2) Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:  Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
3) James is 1 year younger than Corey:  James's age = Corey's age - 1

We also know that:

4) Emily has 4 children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.

Using equations (1) and (2), we can solve for Amy's age:

Amy's age = (Jackson's age + 5) = (Corey's age - 2)
2 * Amy's age = 2 * (Jackson's age + 5) = 2 * (Corey's age - 2)
2 * Amy's age = 2 * Jackson's age + 10 = 2 * Corey's age - 4
2 * Amy's age - 2 * Corey's age = 10 - 4
-2 * Jackson's age = 6
Jackson's age = -3, which is not a valid solution.

Therefore, there must be an error in the given information, as Jackson's age cannot be negative.<eos>"

Gerald's increased speed would have resulted in a time of 36 seconds for the 400-meter hurdles. However, Lee ran the same distance in 38 seconds, which means that Lee was slower than Gerald. Therefore, it is not possible for Lee to have run the 400-meter hurdles twice as fast as Gerald did.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Of the 200 students of Standard 5, 2/5 are male and 2/3 are female in the women's group.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
There are 400 students in Standard 5, as 200 is the total number of students. 

Out of the 400 students, 2/5 are male, which means that 80 students are male. 

The remaining students are female, which is 2/3 of the total number of students. To find out how many female students there are, we can multiply the total number of students by 2/3:

(400 x 2/3) = 266.67

However, since we are dealing with whole numbers, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 267. 

Therefore, there are 267 female students in the women's group.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Harry slept for nine hours a night. His friend James slept for two thirds of Harry's day. How many hours did Harry sleep more than James?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To find out how many hours Harry slept more than James, we need to subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept for 9 hours, and James slept for 2/3 of Harry's day. To find out how many hours that is, we need to multiply 9 by 2/3:

9 x 2/3 = 6 hours

So James slept for 6 hours. To find out how many hours Harry slept more than James, we subtract 9 from 6:

9 - 6 = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 hours more than James.<eos>"

There are several reasons why traffic jams may not occur in the first 15 minutes even if there are 30 of them on the intersection. One reason could be that the traffic flow is not evenly distributed, with some vehicles taking longer to pass through the intersection than others. Another reason could be that the traffic volume is not consistent throughout the day, with more vehicles appearing later on. Additionally, other factors such as weather conditions or road work may affect the traffic flow and cause jams to occur later in the day.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Jerome had 4 friends visiting him in a day. The first friend knocked on the door 20 times before Jerome opened it. The second friend knocked on the door 1/4 more times than Jerome's first friend. Therefore, the second friend knocked on the door:

20 x 1.25 = 25 times

The third friend knocked on the door 10 times than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend knocked on the door 60 times, the third friend would have knocked on the door:

60 - 10 = 50 times

Now we know that Jerome's door was knocked on:

20 + 25 + 50 + 60 = 155 times

Therefore, the door was knocked on 155 times in total.<eos>"

Henry's goal for the tournament was to double what he had won the previous year, which means he wanted to win twice as much as he did last year. After eating the bread, he decided to eat 15 loaves of bread instead of just one, which shows that he was not thinking clearly or had lost his focus on his original goal. He also reduced his weight by 5 pounds, which means he was trying to improve his physical condition, but it is unclear how this relates to his goal of winning the tournament. Finally, he currently weighs 110 pounds, but it is not clear how this information is relevant to the context.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to the current exchange rate for your currency. However, if you are asking how much the company will deduct from the total cost of 10 barrels of oil, it would be:

10 barrels x $3.00 per barrel = $30.00

If the company is giving back $0.20 per barrel, they will deduct:

10 barrels x $0.20 per barrel = $2.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 10 barrels of oil would be:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, if someone bought 10 barrels of oil, they would pay $28.00 for the oil.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that each teacher uses the white table twice per day and that the table is wiped three times per lesson, the total number of times the white table will be wiped in one day can be calculated as follows:

Total number of lessons per day = 2 (lessons per teacher) x 4 (teachers) = 8 lessons
Total number of times the table is wiped per lesson = 3
Total number of times the white table will be wiped in one day = 8 lessons x 3 wipes per lesson = 24 times.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
Assuming that the number of photographs taken by tourists in Brittany is x, then according to the given information, the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 6x. The number of photographs taken by tourists in Brittany is 50 times more than the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal in the zoo, which means that the number of photographs taken by tourists in the zoo is (6x/50) or (3/25)x. 

If the number of photographs taken by tourists in Jamal is 1800, then 6x = 1800, which gives x = 300. Therefore, the number of photographs taken by tourists in the zoo is (3/25)x = (3/25) * 300 = 36.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I am not sure which african language you are referring to. however, i can provide a translation into english and answer the question in english.

sasha finds that the price of trees has increased by 50% in the last few months, which means that the cost of trees has doubled. she still has some trees left and plans to sell them to make a profit. she has ten 2 x 4 x 10 tables that cost $10 each, which means she paid a total of $100 for all ten tables. she also has five 4 x 4 x 10 tables that she bought for $16 each, which means she paid a total of $80 for all five tables. 

if she sells all of her tables, she will make a profit based on the original cost and the current price of the trees. to determine her profit, she needs to calculate the current value of her tables based on the increased price of trees. let's assume that the current price of trees is $20 per 2 x 4 x 10 table and $32 per 4 x 4 x 10 table.

if sasha sells all of her tables, she will make a profit of:

(10 x $10) + (5 x $16) = $100 + $80 = $180

current value of tables:

(10 x $20) + (5 x $32) = $200 + $160 = $360

profit = $360 - $180 = $180

therefore, if sasha sells all of her tables, she will make a profit of $180.<eos>"

Katy uses a teaspoon of sugar and a cup of water in a ratio of 7:13 for coffee. If in total, she used 120 teaspoons of sugar and a cup of water, find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
In this ratio of 7:13, we can say that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. Therefore, if Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, we can calculate how much water she used by multiplying the number of teaspoons of sugar by the number of cups of water in the ratio.

120 teaspoons of sugar x (13 cups of water / 7 teaspoons of sugar) = 208 cups of water

So, Katy used 208 cups of water in total.<eos>"

Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries are higher, and Adrien earns $400,000 more than four years ago, what is the difference between their salaries?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's start by finding out what Lylah's current salary is. Since we know that her salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago, we can calculate her current salary as follows:

Current salary = Previous salary x 1.4

We don't know what Lylah's previous salary was, but we do know that it was 30% less than Adrien's salary. So, we can express Lylah's previous salary as a percentage of Adrien's salary as follows:

Lylah's previous salary = Adrien's salary x 0.7

We also know that Adrien's salary is $400,000 more than it was four years ago. So, we can express Adrien's current salary as follows:

Current salary = Previous salary + $400,000

Now, let's find out the difference between their salaries. We can do this by subtracting Lylah's current salary from Adrien's current salary:

Difference = Adrien's current salary - Lylah's current salary

Difference = (Previous salary + $400,000) - (Previous salary x 1.4)

Difference = Previous salary + $400,000 - Previous salary - 0.4 x Previous salary

Difference = 0.6 x Previous salary + $400,000

We still don't know what the previous salaries were, but we can't calculate the difference without knowing them. So, unfortunately, we can't give you a specific answer to this question.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
I cannot provide an answer in an african language. however, i can help you with the english translation of the given text. 

the text mentions that one hospital sees five hundred patients a day and one patient is seen every forty minutes. the doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital, and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. 

to calculate the profit the hospital gets from these visits, we need to know how many hours the hospital is open and how many patients are seen during those hours. let's assume the hospital is open for 12 hours a day, from 8am to 8pm. 

during those 12 hours, the hospital would see:

(12 hours x 60 minutes per hour) / 40 minutes per patient = 180 patients

if the hospital charges $200 an hour for each patient, they would generate:

180 patients x $200 per patient = $36,000 in revenue per day

however, the hospital also pays the doctor $150 an hour for each patient, so their actual profit would be:

$36,000 in revenue - ($150 per patient x 180 patients) = $12,000 in profit per day

therefore, the hospital gets a profit of $12,000 per day from these visits.<eos>"

Nissa hired sixty part-time workers to work as caterpillars at her factory in Santa's village. One-third of the caterpillars died when the children spat on them, and ten percent of the remaining caterpillars died when the children got down on their knees. How many caterpillars are left?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of caterpillars left, we need to first determine how many survived the children's spit and then subtract the number that died when the children got down on their knees. 

Let's start with the number of caterpillars that survived the children's spit. Since one-third of the caterpillars died, the remaining two-thirds survived. If there were originally sixty caterpillars, then two-thirds of that is:

(60 x 2/3) = 40 caterpillars survived the spit.

Now, we need to subtract the number of caterpillars that died when the children got down on their knees. If ten percent of the remaining caterpillars died, then we need to calculate what ten percent of 40 is:

(40 x 10/100) = 4 caterpillars died when the children got down on their knees.

So, the final number of caterpillars left is:

40 - 4 = 36 caterpillars.<eos>"

Therefore, Joseph made a budget of $560 in the two months.<eos>"

4 x $15 = $60

Therefore, Tom pays $60 for his laundry in a year.<eos>"

There are only twenty-seven gates left in the world. One-fifth of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of the gates in Scotland are female. How many female gates are there?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Two-thirds of the gates in Scotland are female, so we need to find out how many gates there are in total first. Let's assume there are a total of 100 gates in Scotland (this is just an example). If two-thirds of the gates are female, then we can calculate the number of female gates as follows:

2/3 x 100 = 66.67

Therefore, there are approximately 66.67 female gates in Scotland. However, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that there are 100 gates in total. The actual number of gates in Scotland may be different, and the gender ratio may also vary.<eos>"

Answer only. 
If the price of a bag of jewelry is $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then what is the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have access to real-time data or the ability to perform calculations outside of simple arithmetic. however, i can provide you with the formula to calculate the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months.

let's say the original price of the bag of jewelry is $20. after two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which is $4 (20% of $20). the new price after two months is $24.

after another two months (i.e., four months in total), the price increases by another 20% of the new price of $24, which is $4.80 (20% of $24). the new price after four months is $28.80.

you can continue this pattern for thirty months, where the price increases by 20% of the previous price every two months. the formula to calculate the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months is:

p = a(1 + r)^n

where:

p = the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months
a = the original price of the bag of jewelry ($20)
r = the rate of increase (20% or 0.2)
n = the number of periods (thirty months, or 15 two-month periods)

substituting the values into the formula, we get:

p = 20(1 + 0.2)^15

p = 20(1.2)^15

p ≈ $798.63

therefore, the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months is approximately $798.63.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Jackie decided to pay her own bills, she would be adding 3 hours to her own work. If she charges $35/hour for her own work, she would make $105 in total for the 3 hours of work. However, she would also lose $35/hour in unpaid wages, which means she would only make $70 for the 3 hours of work.

If she hired an accountant, she would pay $90 for the service. In order to break even, she would need to earn at least $90 in additional income from her own work. If she charges $35/hour for her own work, she would need to work for at least 2.5 hours in order to earn $90.

Therefore, if Jackie decided to hire an accountant, she would need to work for at least 2.5 hours in order to break even. If she worked more than that, she would make more money than if she paid her own bills.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much money Elvira would need to spend on her clothes, we need to first determine how much money she has left after purchasing her computer and accessories. 

Elvira spent €1090 on the computer itself, €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer. This totals to €1323 spent on technology. 

To determine how much money she has left to spend on her clothes, we subtract the total amount spent on technology from her initial savings of €1500:

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Seth is three times as old as Brooke. In two years, they're about twenty years older. How old is Seth?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
I do not have access to current information or calculations, but i can provide you with a general solution to the problem.

let's say seth's current age is x. according to the given statement, brooke's current age is x/3. in two years, their ages will be (x+2) and (x/3+2), respectively.

since their ages combined are about twenty years older, we can write the equation:

(x+2) + (x/3 + 2) = 20

solving for x, we get:

x = 12

therefore, seth is currently 12 years old.<eos>"

Pancho walks twenty miles a day. If not on weekends, he walks ten miles. How many miles can he walk in a week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that Pancho walks 10 miles on weekdays and 20 miles on weekends, the total number of miles he can walk in a week is:

(10 miles x 5 days) + (20 miles x 2 days) = 50 miles + 40 miles = 90 miles

Therefore, Pancho can walk 90 miles in a week.<eos>"

The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Based on the information given, the cost of the pants would be:

Cost of hat = $25
Cost of jacket = 3 x $25 = $75
Cost of pants = (cost of hat + cost of jacket) / 2 = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform (including hat, jacket, and pants) would be:

$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150<eos>"

Jessica tries to figure out how much money she will need to pay off all of her bills each month. Her monthly student loan payment is $300, her monthly credit card payment is $200, and her monthly mortgage payment is $500. If Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debt, how much will she pay off in a year?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate how much Jessica will pay off in a year, we need to first determine how much of her debt she wants to pay off. Let's say she wants to pay off more than 50% of her debt. This means she will pay off more than $2000 (50% of her total debt).

To figure out how much she will pay off in a year, we need to add up her monthly payments for each bill and multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year). This gives us:

$300 (student loan payment) + $200 (credit card payment) + $500 (mortgage payment) = $1000 per month

$1000 per month x 12 months = $12,000 per year

So if Jessica wants to pay off more than 50% of her debt, she will need to pay off at least $2000 more than what she pays in a year, which is $12,000. Therefore, she will pay off at least $14,000 in a year.<eos>"

A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
The merchant bought the sacks of beans for $20 each and spent $2 to transport each sack to the market. So, his total cost for each sack is $22. 

When he sells each sack for $30, he makes a profit of $30 - $22 = $8 per sack. 

To calculate how many sacks he sells, we can use the formula:

Total Profit = Number of Sacks Sold x Profit per Sack

In this case, the merchant's total profit is $400, and his profit per sack is $8. So, we can calculate the number of sacks he sold as follows:

400 = Number of Sacks Sold x 8

Number of Sacks Sold = 400 / 8 = 50 sacks<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
200 pounds of vegetables should be distributed to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds of vegetables.

To find out how many pounds of vegetables are not used, we need to subtract the total amount of vegetables distributed from the total amount of vegetables available.

Total vegetables available = 200 pounds

Total vegetables distributed = 40 restaurants x 2 pounds per restaurant = 80 pounds

Therefore, the amount of vegetables not used = Total vegetables available - Total vegetables distributed

= 200 pounds - 80 pounds

= 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of vegetables are not used.<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
Josie's vineyard has a total of 90 acres (10 acres x 9), and he harvests 5 tons of grapes from each nine acres. So, he harvests a total of:

5 tons x 9 = 45 tons of grapes from his entire vineyard.

Since each grape yields 2 barrels of wine, he can produce:

45 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 90 barrels of wine from his entire vineyard each year.<eos>"

I cannot provide a numerical answer without additional information about the specific cups being referred to in the statement. however, if we assume that the prices mentioned in the statement are for different types of cups and we want to calculate the price of one cup from each type, we can do the following:

for the twelve cups that cost $1200, we can calculate the price of one cup by dividing $1200 by 12, which gives us $100 per cup.

for the dozen small cups that cost $6000, we can calculate the price of one cup by dividing $6000 by 12, which gives us $500 per cup.

if we want to compare the prices of the two types of cups, we can see that the small cups are more expensive than the larger cups by a factor of 5 times ($500 vs $100).<eos>"

<eos>
<|assistant|>
I don't have access to the african language you are referring to. however, i can provide you with an english translation of the problem, and i will assume that the african language uses the same mathematical concepts as english.

sara wants to buy a new bed and a pair of shoes. her favorite bed costs $30, and each shoe costs $20. sara's nanny pays for the baby four times, and she pays $5 for each time she babysits. her parents pay her $4 for every time she walks in the woods. if sarah saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many walks in the woods would she have to make before she could afford the bed and shoes?

to solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the bed and shoes, which is $30 + $20 = $50. then, we need to figure out how much money sarah has saved after babysitting her sister four times and walking in the woods for an unknown number of times. we know that her parents pay her $4 for each walk in the woods, so we can set up an equation:

$4x + $10 = $50

where x is the number of walks in the woods sarah has taken. solving for x, we get:

$4x = $40

x = 10

therefore, sarah would need to walk in the woods 10 times to save enough money to buy the bed and shoes.<eos>"

Jerry had many chickens. The red chickens laid 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens laid 5 eggs a day. Jerry collected 42 eggs a day. If he had two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens did he have?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of red chickens ""r"" and the number of white chickens ""w"". 

We know that:

- The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so in total they lay 3r eggs per day.
- The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so in total they lay 5w eggs per day.
- Together, they lay 42 eggs per day, so we can write the equation: 3r + 5w = 42.

We also know that:

- There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying and solving for r, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

8r = 32

r = 4

So Jerry had 4 red chickens.<eos>"

She plans to make her meal more than $3.00 worth of chips and wine. If she had a $5.00 gift card, she could afford it. How much does she still owe?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the total cost of the ingredients, we need to add up the cost of each item:

Burrito: $6.50
Pasta: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Two side dishes: $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50

Total cost of ingredients: $11.25

If she plans to spend more than $3.00 on chips and wine, let's say she spends $5.00:

Cost of chips and wine: $5.00

To calculate how much she still owes, we need to add up the total cost of the ingredients and the cost of the chips and wine, and then subtract the amount of the gift card she used:

Total cost: $11.25 + $5.00 = $16.25
Amount used on gift card: $5.00

Amount still owed: $16.25 - $5.00 = $11.25

Therefore, she still owes $11.25.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
I am not sure what african language you are referring to, but i can answer your question in english.

given that ashlyn brought home 30% of the apples two months later and found that 3/4 of the apples were ready for harvest two weeks later, we can calculate the total number of apples that will be harvested as follows:

- ashlyn brought home 30% of the apples two months later, which means she left 70% of the apples on the tree.
- two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 70% of the apples were ready for harvest, which means 21% of the total number of apples were harvested.

therefore, the total number of apples that will be harvested is:

30% + 21% = 51%

of the total number of apples on the trees.<eos>"

Answer only. 
Thirty-three penguins were burned in the snow. One-third of them jumped in and drowned in the oil. One-third returned to the cave to feed. How many penguins still sunbathe?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
Assuming that there were no penguins that died from other causes besides drowning in the oil or returning to the cave to feed, there would be 11 penguins left to sunbathe. This is because 33 penguins burned in the snow, and one-third of that (i.e., 11 penguins) either jumped in and drowned in the oil or returned to the cave to feed. Therefore, 33 - 11 = 22 penguins would have initially survived the snow, and one-third of that (i.e., 22/3 = 7.33 penguins) would have drowned or returned to the cave, leaving approximately 14.67 penguins (i.e., 22 - 7.33 = 14.67) to sunbathe. However, since penguins cannot fractionally sunbathe, we can round up to 15 penguins or down to 11 penguins.<eos>"

Mary is two years older than Joan, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is twenty years old, then how old are the three girls?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
If Jessa is 20 years old, then we can calculate the age of the other two girls as follows:

- Joan is five years older than Jessa, so her age would be 20 + 5 = 25 years.
- Mary is two years older than Joan, so her age would be 25 + 2 = 27 years.

Therefore, the ages of the three girls are:

- Jessa: 20 years old
- Joan: 25 years old
- Mary: 27 years old<eos>"

<|user|>
Answer only. 
James has six times as much sugar as Robert. John has twice as much sugar as Robert. If John has fifty-four sugars, how many sugars does John have more than James?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much sugar James has. We know that James has six times as much sugar as Robert, so if Robert has x sugars, then James has 6x sugars. 

We also know that John has twice as much sugar as Robert, so John has 2x sugars. 

If John has 54 sugars, then we can set up an equation:

2x = 54

Solving for x, we get:

x = 27

So Robert has 27 sugars. 

Now we can calculate how much sugar James has:

6x = 6 * 27 = 162

So James has 162 sugars. 

To find out how many sugars John has more than James, we simply subtract the number of sugars James has from the number of sugars John has:

54 - 162 = -108

However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that John has less sugar than James, which is not the case. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given information.<eos>"

Mike corresponded with five people. He changed the number of letters he sent to two of them. Each person receives two five-page letters a week. He responds kindly. He can write one page every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing articles a week?
<eos>
<|assistant|>
To calculate the number of hours Mike spends writing articles a week, we first need to determine the total number of pages he writes. 

Mike corresponds with five people, and he sends two five-page letters a week to each person. This means he writes a total of:

5 people x 2 letters per person x 5 pages per letter = 50 pages per week

Next, we know that Mike can write one page every six minutes. To calculate the total number of hours he spends writing, we divide the total number of pages he writes by the number of pages he can write in one hour:

50 pages per week ÷ 1 page per 6 minutes = 30 minutes per week

So, Mike spends 30 minutes a week writing articles. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

30 minutes per week ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours per week

Therefore, Mike spends 0.5 hours, or 30 minutes, writing articles each week.<eos>"
