While shopping for shoes, Gloria found a pair of shoes that would fit her budget. However, she had to choose from a collection of boots and two high-heeled shoes that cost less than five dollars. If one of the high-heeled shoes was $33 and the other was twice as expensive, how much would the shoe cost?
**Answer:** $11

**Explanation:**
Let x be the cost of the less expensive high-heeled shoe.
The cost of the other high-heeled shoe is then 2x.
The cost of the boots is less than $5, so x + 2x < 5
3x < 5
x < 5/3

Vincent could buy 3 cans for $2.50 or 2 cans for $1. How much money would he save to buy 18 cans at a lower price?
