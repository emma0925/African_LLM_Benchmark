Kyle bought last year's edition for $19.50. This included a 25% discount from its original price. What was the actual price of the book?
**Answer:** $25.

**Explanation:**

Let x be the original price of the book.

Then, the discounted price is x - (0.25x) = 0.75x.

We know that the discounted price was $19.50, so:

0.75x = 19.50

Solving for x, we get:

x = 19.50 / 0.75 = $25

Therefore, the actual price of the book was **$25**."

Lee used to be able to run the 400 meters two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400 meters. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, how could Gerald, with his improved diet, manage the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?
Answer: 34.2

Please show the steps to get the answer.

Let x be the time Gerald runs the 400 meters.

Lee's time = x - 2

Gerald's improved time = x - 2 * 0.1 = x - 0.2

Lee's time = 38 seconds

x - 0.2 = 38

x = 38 + 0.2 = 38.2 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **38.2 seconds**."
