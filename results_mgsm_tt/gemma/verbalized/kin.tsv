There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?
There are 12 teachers.

245	The difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
The difference between the number of eggs in the two aquariums is more than twice the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?
Let x be the number of fish in each aquarium.
The number of eggs in the first aquarium is 2x + 1.
The number of eggs in the second aquarium is 3x + 2.
The difference between the number of eggs is 3x + 2 - (2x + 1) = x + 1.
Since the difference is more than twice the number of fish, we have x + 1 > 2x.
Solving for x, we get x < 1.
Therefore, there is **1 fish in each aquarium**."	1
