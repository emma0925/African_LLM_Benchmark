Gloria was shopping for shoes and decided that the price was what she could afford. However, she had to decide between the shoes and a pair of women's shoes that both cost less than the shoes. If one of the women's shoes was $33 and the other was twice as expensive, what was the price of the shoes in dollars?
$66

Please explain the steps to solve the problem.

- The price of the shoes is what Gloria can afford.
- The shoes and two women's shoes cost less than the shoes.
- One women's shoe is $33.
- The other women's shoe is twice as expensive as the first.

**Step 2: Translate the information into equations.**

- Let x be the price of the shoes.
- The price of the first women's shoe is $33.
- The price of the second women's shoe is 2x.

**Step 3: Use the known information to set up an inequality.**

- x + 33 + 2x < x

**Step 4: Solve the inequality.**

- 3x + 33 < x
- 2x < -33
- x < -16.5

35	Mike plays table tennis for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 50% more points than the average. How many points did he score?	9	"Answer only. 
Mike plays table tennis for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 50% more points than the average. How many points did he score?
Let x be the average number of points per minute in the second 20 minutes.
Then, the number of points scored in the second 20 minutes is 20x.
The average number of points per minute for the entire 40 minutes is (4 + 20x)/40.
The problem states that the number of points scored in the second 20 minutes is 1.5 times the average for the entire 40 minutes.
$$20x=1.5\left(\frac{4+20x}{40}\right)\cdot40$$
$$20x=4+20x$$
$$0=4$$

Kalinda and her mother were doing the same work as a 360-degree telescope. Kalinda could add 4 fractions of a minute to each. Her mother could add the number that Kalinda could add in a minute. How many hours would it take them to complete these questions?
The answer is 1 hour.

Please explain the solution.

**Solution:**

If Kalinda adds 4 fractions of a minute to each question, and her mother adds the number that Kalinda can add in a minute, they are essentially doing the same work at a combined rate.

Therefore, the time it takes them to complete the questions is simply the reciprocal of the combined rate.

The combined rate is 1 minute + 4 fractions of a minute = 1 minute and 4/5 minutes = 1.8 minutes.

The time it takes them to complete the questions is:

Time = 1 hour / 1.8 minutes = **1 hour**"	1
