Her parents give her 4$ each time. Who cuts the lawn. If Sara has already saved 10$ before starting to work as a babysitter, how many times does she have to cut the lawn before she can buy sandals?	10	"Answer only. 
Sara wants to buy a new pair of shoes. The shoes she chooses are priced at 30$. A pair of sandals is 20$. Sara takes care of the neighbor's children 4 times. She gets 5$ at a time. Her parents give her 4$ each time. Who cuts the lawn. If Sara has already saved 10$ before starting to work as a babysitter, how many times does she have to cut the lawn before she can buy sandals?
She needs to save 20$ - 10$ = 10$.
She earns 5$ per babysitting shift and 4$ per lawn cutting.
To save 10$, she needs to earn 10$/5$ = 2 lawn cuttings.

Therefore, Sara needs to cut the lawn **2 times** to buy the sandals."	2

There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?
The answer is 10 fish in each aquarium.

Please provide a step-by-step solution.

**Step 1: Define variables**

- Let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium
- Let y be the number of fish in the second aquarium

**Step 2: Translate the given information into equations**

- Difference in carcasses: x + 4 - (y + 32) = 0
- Difference is equal to twice the increase: x + 4 - y - 32 = 2(x - y)

**Step 3: Solve the equations**

- Simplifying the equations: x - y = -4 and x - y = 2(x - y)
- Combining the equations: x - y = -4 and x - y = 2(-4)
- Solving for x and y: x = y = -4

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Therefore, each aquarium has **10 fish**."	10
