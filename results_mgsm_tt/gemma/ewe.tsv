205	If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what would he score on the sixth test that would give him an average of 93?	98	"Answer only. 
If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what would he score on the sixth test that would give him an average of 93?
To find the answer, we can use the formula:
Average = (Sum of scores) / Number of scores
We know the average is 93 and the number of scores is 6.
Let x be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.
93 = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 6
Solving for x, we get:
x = 93 * 6 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 6
x = 558 - 438 / 6
x = 558 - 73
x = **85**

Therefore, Brinley needs to score **85** on the sixth test to have an average of 93."
