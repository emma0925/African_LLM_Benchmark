There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Worth's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?

Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, the jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah watches the neighbor's kids 4 times, and she's getting $5 for each child she watches. Every time she mows the lawn, her parents pay her $4, and if Sarah saves $10 before she starts babysitting, how long before she buys her jacket and shoes?
**Solution:**

Sarah needs $30 + 2($20) = $30 + $40 = $70 in total.

She makes $5 per child x 4 times = $20 from babysitting.
She makes $4 per lawn = $4 x 1 = $4 from mowing the lawn.
She saves $10 before babysitting.

In total, Sarah makes $20 + $4 + $10 = $34.

Therefore, Sarah will need to save for approximately 70-34 = **36 days** to buy the jacket and shoes."

In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?
Let x be the number of fish in each pool.
The number of cormorants in the first pool is 4 + x.
The number of cormorants in the second pool is 32 - x.
The difference in the number of cormorants is (32 - x) - (4 + x) = 28 - 2x.
The difference in the number of cormorants is twice the number of fish: 28 - 2x = 2x.
Solving for x, we get x = 7.
Therefore, there are **7 fish** in each pool."
