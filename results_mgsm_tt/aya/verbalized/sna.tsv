After the movie the person who makes jeans takes 10% off depending on the work done. How much did Jean pay?	27000	<pad> He needs to make-up for 6 hours a week for 4 weeks so he needs to make-up for 6 * 4 = 24 hours. So he needs to make-up for 24 hours * 5 weeks = 120 hours. So he needs to make-up for 120 hours * 250 dollars = $6000. So he needs to make-up for 6000 dollars * 10% = $600. So he needs to make-up for 600 dollars - 600 dollars = $560. So he needs to make-up for 560 dollars / 10% = $560. So he needs to make-up for 560 dollars - 560 dollars = $480. So he needs to make-up for 480 dollars / 10% = $480. So he needs to make-up for 480 dollars - 480 dollars = $360. So he needs to make-up for 360 dollars - 360 dollars = $240. So he needs to make-up for 240 dollars - 240 dollars = $180. So he needs to make-up for 180 dollars - 180 dollars = $90. So he needs to make-up for 90 dollars - 90 dollars = $70. So he needs to make-up for 70 dollars - 70 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $20. So he needs to make-up for 20 dollars - 20 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40. So he needs to make-up for 40 dollars - 40 dollars = $40.	40
