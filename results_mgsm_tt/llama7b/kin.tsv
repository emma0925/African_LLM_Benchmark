Jane's kitchen produces 16 eggs a day, sleeps three every morning and bakes a hot bun with four, selling the rest at the farmer's market every day for 2 cents each egg. And how many dollars does the farmer's market make in a day?

Answer: $32

Explanation:
Jane's kitchen produces 16 eggs a day, which means it sells 16 x 2 cents = $0.32 per egg at the farmer's market. Since the kitchen sells all the eggs it produces, the total revenue from the farmer's market is $0.32 x 16 eggs = $5.12 per day. Therefore, the farmer's market makes $5.12 per day."

6	Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many rabbits do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?	260	"Answer only. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. How many rabbits do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total if Seattle has 20 sheep?

Answer: 120

Explanation:

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 40 = 80 sheep.
Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Total number of sheep = Toulouse + Charleston = 80 + 80 = 160 sheep.

Since each sheep has 7 rabbits, the total number of rabbits = Total number of sheep x Number of rabbits per sheep = 160 x 7 = 1120 rabbits."

The retailer wants to choose what to buy between 2 options. Jewelry worth $5000 or electronics worth $8000. His advisor mathematically predicts that the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% while the electronics market will grow by 1.2% in the same month. If the retailer wants to increase its monthly profit by using options, how much profit will he have?

Answer: $1150.

Explanation:
The retailer will choose to buy jewelry worth $5000, which has a predicted growth rate of 2.5%. This means that the jewelry will increase in value by $1250 ($5000 x 2.5%) in the same month.

The retailer will not buy electronics worth $8000, as it has a predicted growth rate of 1.2%. This means that the electronics will increase in value by $960 ($8000 x 1.2%) in the same month.

Therefore, the total profit for the retailer will be $1150 ($1250 - $960)."

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour as a teacher and $30 an hour as the head coach of the fans. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week and 15 hours a week as the top prize, how much does she get per year?	57500	"Answer only. 
Jill is paid $20 an hour as a teacher and $30 an hour as the head coach of the fans. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week and 15 hours a week as the top prize, how much does she get per year?

Answer: $55,000 per year.

Explanation:

Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher, which means she works 1,770 hours (35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year) in a year.

As the head coach of the fans, Jill works 15 hours a week, which means she works 750 hours (15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year) in a year.

Total hours worked per year = 1,770 (teaching) + 750 (coaching) = 2,520 hours

Jill's hourly rate as a teacher is $20, which means she earns $20 x 2,520 hours = $50,400 per year as a teacher.

As the head coach of the fans, Jill's hourly rate is $30, which means she earns $30 x 750 hours = $22,500 per year as the head coach of the fans.

Total income per year = $50,400 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $73,000 per year."

21	If Raymond and Samantha had children, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?	14	"Answer only. 
If Raymond and Samantha had children, Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Raymond had a younger son when he was 23 years old, so he was 23 - 6 = 17 years old when his son was born.
Samantha is now 31 years old, so Raymond's son was born 31 - 17 = 14 years ago."

* Marie paid a total of $50.
* She ordered a chicken dinner for $12.
* She bought 5 milk cartons for $3 each.
* She bought 4 pizza boxes for $1.50 each.

Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many pizza boxes Marie bought. We know that the total amount Marie paid is $50, and the cost of each pizza box is $1.50. Therefore, the number of pizza boxes Marie bought is:

$50 / $1.50 = 33

So, Marie bought 33 pizza boxes. Since each box sold for $8.50, Marie spent a total of:

33 x $8.50 = $277.50

Therefore, the answer is 4 pizza boxes."

Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes, in the first 20 minutes he scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes he scored 25% more points. And how many points did he score in total?

Answer: 
Mike scored a total of 70 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong.

In the next 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points, which is 25% of 80 = 20 points. So, he scored a total of 80 + 20 = 100 points in the second half of the game.
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 100 points in 40 minutes of playing ping pong."

51	Tom's boat can go 10 miles per hour. He goes from 1 to 4pm. He goes back to 6mph. How long does it take him to get back there?	5	"Answer only. 
Tom's boat can go 10 miles per hour. He goes from 1 to 4pm. He goes back to 6mph. How long does it take him to get back there?

Answer: 2 hours

Explanation:

Let's first find the distance Tom traveled during the trip from 1 to 4 pm. Since he traveled at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance he traveled is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours (from 1 to 4 pm)
Distance = 50 miles

Now, Tom slows down to 6 miles per hour. To find the time it takes him to get back to the starting point, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know the distance Tom traveled (50 miles), and we want to find the time it takes him to get back to the starting point. Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 50 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 8.33 hours (or 2 hours and 20 minutes)

Therefore, it takes Tom 2 hours to get back to the starting point."

Judy teaches 5 gym classes daily, 8 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much does she earn in 1 week?

Answer: $12,600.00

Explanation:

Judy teaches 5 gym classes daily, which means she teaches a total of 25 classes per week (5 x 5 = 25).

On weekdays, Judy teaches 8 classes, and each class has 15 students, so she earns $15.00 x 8 x 15 = $12,000.00 per week.

On Saturdays, Judy teaches 8 classes as well, and each class has 15 students, so she earns $15.00 x 8 x 15 = $12,000.00 per week.

Therefore, Judy earns a total of $12,000.00 + $12,000.00 = $24,000.00 per week."

Tommy is raising funds for his charity by selling $3 brownies and $4 cheesecakes. Tommy's sold 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes. How much money did Tommy collect?

Answer: $146

Explanation:

To find out how much money Tommy collected, we need to multiply the number of brownies and cheesecakes he sold by their respective prices.

Number of brownies sold = 43
Price of brownies = $3
Total amount collected from brownies = 43 x $3 = $135

Number of cheesecakes sold = 23
Price of cheesecakes = $4
Total amount collected from cheesecakes = 23 x $4 = $92

Total amount collected = $135 + $92 = $227

Therefore, Tommy collected $227 in total."

Sheila bought five phones for $150 each over a three-month period.An interest of 2% will be paid on each unit.What about Sheila's monthly payments over 3 months?

Answer: $150 x 3 = $450

Explanation: To calculate Sheila's monthly payments, we need to multiply the total cost of the phones by the number of months she has to pay for them. Since she paid $150 for each phone over a three-month period, the total cost of the phones is $450 (5 phones x $150 each). Therefore, Sheila's monthly payments are $450 / 3 months = $150 per month."

Grea has an alarm to speak three times a day that she remembers. When the alarm goes off, she continues to speak until Greg turns it off. The first time she turned it off today it sounded four times. The second time she turned it off, she cried three times more than the first time. The third time she cried half as much as the second time, how many times did the alarm go off in total?

Please help me solve this problem. I am stuck and would appreciate any guidance.

Answer: 
The alarm went off a total of 11 times.

Explanation:

Grea's alarm goes off three times a day, so the total number of times it can go off in a day is 3 x 3 = 9 times.

Since the alarm went off four times the first time Grea turned it off, it must have gone off five times the second time (3 times original + 2 extra times).

Therefore, the alarm went off a total of 9 + 5 = 14 times in the day.

Since the alarm went off half as much the third time as the second time, it went off 14 / 2 = 7 times the third time.

So, the alarm went off a total of 9 + 5 + 7 = 11 times in the day."

The fog rolls in from the sea to cover the city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 kilometers of the city. If the city is 42 kilometers from the sea to the other side, how many minutes will it take for the fog to cover the entire city?

Answer: 420 minutes

Explanation:

The fog rolls in from the sea to cover the city in 10 minutes for every 3 kilometers of the city. This means that it will take 10 minutes for the fog to cover the first 3 kilometers of the city, then 10 minutes for the next 3 kilometers, and so on.

Since the city is 42 kilometers from the sea to the other side, it will take 420 minutes (or 7 hours) for the fog to cover the entire city.

Therefore, the answer is 420 minutes."

The hospital receives 500 patients per day. Each patient is admitted for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and hospitals charge patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital gain from these revivals?

Answer: $30000 per day

Explanation:

To calculate the profit of the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent on reviving patients and multiply it by the hourly charge of the doctors and hospitals.

Total time spent on reviving patients = 500 patients per day x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes per day

Hourly charge of doctors = $150 per hour
Hourly charge of hospitals = $200 per hour

Profit of hospital = Total time spent on reviving patients x Hourly charge of doctors x Hourly charge of hospitals
= 12,000 minutes per day x $150 per hour x $200 per hour
= $30,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital gains a profit of $30,000 per day from reviving patients."

Jordan plays video games 2 hours a day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?

Answer: $140

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, which is equivalent to 14 hours a week (2 hours/day x 7 days/week). If he spent his time playing video games instead of working, he would earn $0 from his part-time job. Therefore, his total weekly earnings would be $140 ($0 from work + $140 from video games)."

The profit is the difference between her total income and her spending, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?

Answer: $44

Explanation:
Lucas will make a profit of $44 each week because the total income from her 3 customers is $92, and she spends $2 x 3 = $6 on java water for each customer, and $5 x 3 = $15 on laundry for each customer. Therefore, the total amount she spends is $6 + $15 = $21. So, the profit is $92 - $21 = $44."

Answer: 60 bees.

Explanation:

Debra saw 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours, which means that 30 bees had gone out. Then, half of the remaining bees (i.e., 1/2 x 30 = 15 bees) went out in the next 6 hours. So, the total number of bees that went out during the day was 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

Since Debra saw twice as many bees as she had seen before leaving the hive, the number of bees coming back to the hive in the last 6 hours was twice 45 = 90 bees. Therefore, Debra saw 90 bees coming back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."

On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came to have both of their bikes lifted. 3 people came to have all of their motorcycle tires lifted. Later, one person came to the bike altogether. How much money did he make that day?

Answer: $175

Explanation:

The total number of bikes and motorcycles lifted on the first day is 5 + 3 = 8. Each bike costs $25 to lift, so the total cost of lifting all the bikes is 8 x $25 = $200. Since 3 people came to have all of their motorcycle tires lifted, and each tire costs $10 to lift, the total cost of lifting all the tires is 3 x $10 = $30. Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made on the first day is $200 + $30 = $230."

Answer: 21

Explanation:

Dave ate 19 French fries before the bird stole the packet. The bird took half of the fries Dave had eaten, which is 9 fries. So, the total number of French fries the bird took was 19 + 9 = 28.

Then, three pigeons chased Dave away from the nest and ate 3 fries.

Marcoun stole 2 fries from the remaining 3.

Finally, the ants took the last 5 fries.

Therefore, the total number of French fries in the packet when Dave bought them was 28 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 38."

In the room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll.A doll costs about 3 action figures and one red car costs $4.How much did all the toys cost, if the action figures cost $5?

Answer: $135.

Explanation:

* A doll costs $3 action figures, so 3 action figures cost $15.
* A red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost $20.
* In total, the action figures cost $15 + $20 = $35.
* Therefore, all the toys together cost $35 + $35 = $70.

If the action figures cost $5 each, then the total cost of all the toys is $5 x 3 = $15."

Answer: $55

Explanation:

If Jackie pays her own taxes, she will lose $35/hour in income by working 3 fewer hours. This means she will make $35/hour less than she would if she hired a bookkeeper.

If she hires a bookkeeper, she will save $90 (the cost of the bookkeeper's services) and will be able to work 3 more hours of freelance work. This means she will make $35/hour more than she would if she paid her own taxes.

Therefore, the amount more that Jackie would make if she hired a bookkeeper is $55 ($90 - $35/hour)."

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemons.For each lemon they make, it costs $3 for the lemon and $2 for the sugar.They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for each lemon.If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on the lemon?

Answer: $21

Explanation:

Juan and Carlos sell 20 bottles of lemonade for each lemon they make. So, if they sell 100 lemons, they will sell 2000 bottles of lemonade.

The cost of each lemon is $3 + $2 = $5. So, they spend $5 on each lemon.

Since they made a profit of $25, they sold 2000 bottles of lemonade at $0.50 each, which is a total of $1000. Subtracting the cost of each lemon ($5) gives the total amount they spent on lemons: $1000 - $5 = $21."

In the competition with 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese, the rest were Chinese.If the number of boys in the Chinese team was 60, how many girls were in the Chinese team?

Answer: 40

Explanation:
Let's say the total number of Chinese students in the competition is x. Since 80 were Japanese and 40 were Chinese, we can write:

x + 80 = 240

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese students were boys, so the number of girls in the Chinese team is:

x - 60 = 40

Solving the equation, we get:

x = 140

So, there were 140 Chinese students in the competition, of which 60 were boys and 40 were girls."

Lloyd earned $10 an hour teaching math. He taught 5 hours the first week and 8 hours the second week. How much did he make in the first two weeks?

To find out how much Lloyd made in the first two weeks, you need to multiply the number of hours he taught in each week by his hourly wage.

For the first week, he taught 5 hours, so he made:

5 hours x $10/hour = $50

For the second week, he taught 8 hours, so he made:

8 hours x $10/hour = $80

Adding the two amounts together gives you the total amount Lloyd made in the first two weeks:

$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd made $130 in the first two weeks."

Jerry is throwing a six-sided dice.What is the approximate probability that he is more likely to throw 3 dice than he is to throw two consecutive funny numbers?

Answer: 0.72

Explanation:

The probability of throwing a 3 is 1/6, and the probability of throwing two consecutive funny numbers is (1/6) × (1/6) = 1/36.

Tom plants 10 trees a year.Every year he also cuts down 2 trees a year.He started with 50 trees.After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.How many trees are left?

Answer: 20 trees

Explanation:

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years, he has planted a total of 100 trees (10 x 10 = 100).

Every year, Tom cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years, he has cut down a total of 20 trees (2 x 10 = 20).

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, leaving Tom with 80 trees (100 - 20 = 80).

Therefore, Tom has 20 trees left."

200 kilograms of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a given city.Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of carrots.How many kilograms of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 190 kilograms.

Therefore, Elaine now has 80 Pokémon cards at one time."

John won a prize at work.The prize includes a one-time cash award of $5000 and a 5% salary increase.If he earns $2000 per week,every week of the year and receives the prize on the first day of the year, how much did he earn that year?

Answer: $104,000.

Explanation:

The prize includes a one-time cash award of $5000, which John received on the first day of the year.

If John earns $2000 per week, every week of the year, and receives the prize on the first day of the year, he will have earned a total of $104,000 that year.

Here's the calculation:

104 weeks x $2000 per week = $20,800 per year
+ $5000 one-time cash award = $25,800 per year

So, John earned a total of $25,800 + $5000 = $30,800 that year."

How many slices of cheese did he use?

Answer: 20 slices of cheese.

Explanation:

* Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day this week, and each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.
* Carl ate cheese and eggs for breakfast 3 days a week, and he spent half as much on eggs as he did on sandwiches. So, if he spent $x on sandwiches, he spent $x/2 on eggs. Let's say the cost of eggs is $y. Therefore, Carl spent a total of $x + y on breakfast.
* Carl made a large plate of pasta and cheese for several meals a week, and he used 8 slices of cheese in it.

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is: 14 + (x + y) + 8 = 20."

On Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes.
On the second day, she went to a different store and bought 3 times as many cakes, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.
On the third day, she went to another store and bought 5 times as many cakes as she had bought on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Jerry has a lot of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let's assume the number of red chickens is x. Since red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x.

Since white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 eggs.

Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. So, the number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens.

We can set up the equation:

3x = 10 + 2

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

Therefore, Jerry has 20 red chickens."
212	Gary enjoys walking around the edge of the local park, which is a roughly 1 mile, 6 inches square.If he walks 3 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to walk?	5	"Answer only. 
Gary enjoys walking around the edge of the local park, which is a roughly 1 mile, 6 inches square.If he walks 3 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to walk?

Answer: 

50 minutes

Explanation:

To find the time it will take Gary to walk around the edge of the park, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 1 mile, 6 inches (which is equal to 1.000006 miles), and the speed is 3 miles per hour.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Time = 1.000006 miles / 3 miles/hour = 50 minutes

Therefore, it will take Gary 50 minutes to walk around the edge of the park."

Answer: 300.

Explanation:
On the first day, Sloane saw 100 customers. On the second day, she saw 50 more customers than she had seen on the first day, so she saw 150 customers (100 + 50). On the third day, she saw 50 more customers than she had seen on the second day, so she saw 200 customers (150 + 50). Therefore, the total number of customers Sloane surveyed on the third day was 300 (200 + 100)."

Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay her back with an additional 10% interest. If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much money will Janeth have left over?

Answer: $425

Explanation:

Janeth borrowed $2,000 with a promise to pay back with an additional 10% interest. This means that the total amount Janeth owes is $2,000 + ($2,000 x 10%) = $2,200.

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months. This means that she pays a total of $165 x 12 = $2,000.

So, after paying back the full amount, Janeth will have $2,200 - $2,000 = $200 left over.

Therefore, the answer is $425."

James is counting Pokemon cards.He has 30 types of fire, 20 types of grass, and 40 types of water.If he loses 8 types of water and buys 14 types of grass, what is the probability (based on the nearest whole number) that the randomly selected card will be a type of water?

Answer: 1/3

Explanation:

James initially has 40 cards of water, which means the probability of randomly selecting a water card is 40/100 = 1/3.

After losing 8 water cards, James has 32 water cards left, which means the probability of randomly selecting a water card is now 32/100 = 1/3.

When James buys 14 types of grass, the total number of cards he has remains the same, so the probability of randomly selecting a water card remains the same at 1/3."

Callie is working with her mother on a 360-piece puzzle.Callie can typically add 4 pieces per minute.Callie's mother can typically add half as many pieces per minute.How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?

Answer: 6 hours.

Explanation:
Callie can add 4 pieces per minute, so she can complete 4 x 360 = 1440 pieces in 1 hour.
Her mother can add half as many pieces per minute, so she can complete 1440 / 2 = 720 pieces in 1 hour.
Since they are working together, they will complete the entire puzzle in 1440 / 2 = 720 minutes, or 6 hours."

Mark bought 12 cars for use in his company.Each car sold for $20,000.He paid 10% tax on each car, then paid an additional $1,000 to register each car.How much did he pay for each item?

Answer: $21,000

Explanation:

1. Calculate the cost of each car without tax: $20,000 x 12 = $240,000
2. Calculate the tax on each car: $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
3. Calculate the total cost of each car including tax: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000
4. Calculate the additional registration fee for each car: $264,000 x $1,000 = $264,000
5. Calculate the final cost of each car: $264,000 + $264,000 = $528,000

Therefore, Mark paid $528,000 for the 12 cars."

1. Kylie collected 5 more snails than Robert, who collected 20.

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 snails.

2. Kylie collected twice as many snails as she collected on Monday.

So, if Kylie collected x snails on Monday, she collected 2x snails on Tuesday.

So, Kylie collected 25 snails on Tuesday."

Mike corresponded with five people.He eventually stopped corresponding with two of them.Each of them sent two letters a week, totaling five pages.He replied in kind.He could write a page every 6 minutes.How many hours a week did he spend writing?

Answer: 10 hours

Explanation:
Mike corresponded with 5 people, and he eventually stopped corresponding with 2 of them. Let's assume that he corresponded with these 5 people for 5 weeks, since each of them sent 2 letters a week.

Total number of letters Mike received = 5 people x 2 letters/week x 5 weeks = 50 letters

Since Mike replied in kind, he wrote 50 letters in total.

Now, we need to calculate how many hours a week Mike spent writing. Let's assume it takes him 1 minute to write a letter.

Total time spent writing letters = Total number of letters / Time taken to write each letter
= 50 letters / 1 minute/letter
= 50 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours as follows:

Total hours spent writing letters/week = Total minutes/week x 60 minutes/hour
= 50 minutes/week x 60 minutes/hour
= 30 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spent 30 hours a week writing letters."

Griffin had 24 yards, but Kyle caught 5 of them.Billy caught twice as many yards as Kyle.Ginger gave Griffin a fistful of his yards, and then Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer yards than Kyle.If Griffin had 27 yards, how many yards did Ginger give Griffin?

Answer: 9

Explanation:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem to set up an equation. Let x be the number of yards Ginger gave Griffin.

According to the problem, Kyle caught 5 yards, Billy caught twice as many yards as Kyle, and Colby gave Griffin 3 fewer yards than Kyle. So, Billy caught 10 yards (twice as many as Kyle).

Griffin had 24 yards, plus the number of yards Ginger gave him, equals 27 yards. So, we can set up the equation:

24 + x = 27

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 3

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 9 yards."

Jean's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She has to do the most expensive makeup on the show and it takes her 6 hours a day and she has to do it 4 times a week.The film takes 5 weeks to complete.After the film is over, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount based on the amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?

Answer: $16,000.

Explanation:

First, calculate the total hours worked by the makeup artist:
6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, calculate the total amount earned by the makeup artist:
$250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000

Now, calculate the amount of the discount:
$30,000 x 10% = $3,000

Finally, calculate the amount paid by Jean:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup services."

The chef bought 4 bags of biscuits.Each bag weighs 50 kg.One kilogram of biscuits costs $1.50.How much did the chef spend?

Answer: $600

Explanation:
The chef bought 4 bags of biscuits, and each bag weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of biscuits the chef bought is 4 x 50 kg = 200 kg.

Since one kilogram of biscuits costs $1.50, the total cost of the biscuits the chef bought is 200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300.

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on biscuits."

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister.Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, and another 13 the next day.If one cookie has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?

Answer: 800 calories.

Explanation:
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies, and her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies, and her sister ate 13 cookies.
So, the total number of cookies Sue ate more than her sister is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate a total of 46 x 200 = 8000 calories more than her sister."
