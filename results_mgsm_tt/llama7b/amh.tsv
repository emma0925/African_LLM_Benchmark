A trader wants to make a choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. The financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% in the same month and the electronics market will increase by 1.2%. If the trader wants to increase his profit by making a choice at the end of this month, how much profit will this be?

Answer: $2,700

Explanation:

Let's calculate the profit from each option:

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125

Option 2: Electronics worth $8,000
Profit = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96

Since the trader wants to increase his profit by making a choice at the end of this month, the total profit from both options is:

$125 + $96 = $221

Therefore, the trader will make a profit of $2,700 ($221 x 12)."

19	It took her an hour to walk the first four miles, and then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wanted her average speed to be four miles per hour, what speed (percentage miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?	6	"Answer only. 
It took her an hour to walk the first four miles, and then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wanted her average speed to be four miles per hour, what speed (percentage miles per hour) would she need to walk the rest of the way?

Answer: 100%

Explanation:

If it took her an hour to walk the first four miles, then her speed for that distance was 4 miles/hour. To find the speed for the remaining distance, we need to divide the distance left to travel by the time taken to travel the first four miles.

Distance left = 4 miles - 4 miles = 0 miles
Time taken = 1 hour

Speed = Distance / Time = 0 miles / 1 hour = 0%

Since the distance left to travel is zero, her average speed for the entire journey would be zero percent. Therefore, the answer is 100%."
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths water, but when I pour it, I pour one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Answer: 17 liters

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the amount of water in the orange juice:

2/3 x 10 liters = 6.67 liters (water in orange juice)

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple juice:

3/5 x 15 liters = 9 liters (water in pineapple juice)

Total amount of water = 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters

Since you poured one liter of orange juice, the remaining amount of water in the mixture is:

15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters

Therefore, there are 14.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 spiral candles. A pound of beeswax and wikis costs $10.00 in supply. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Answer: $160.00

Explanation:

Charlie can make 10 spiral candles per pound of beeswax, so if he uses 1 pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles.

The cost of the beeswax and wick is $10.00 per pound, so if he uses 1 pound of beeswax, the total cost is $10.00.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, he will make $2.00 per candle.

To find the net profit, we need to subtract the cost of the beeswax and wick from the total amount of money he made from selling the candles:

$2.00 x 20 candles = $40.00

$40.00 - $10.00 (cost of beeswax and wick) = $30.00 net profit

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $30.00."

The Dotfire sisters were driving home with seven cats from a local animal shelter when their mother called to tell them that two of their cats had kittens. The first cat, Patsy, says she has three times as many cats, and the other, Trixie, says she has 12. How many cats does the Dotfire family have now?

Answer: 17

A wooden bridge can't carry more than 5000 kg. A freight truck filled with the same boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the fuel and empty car is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded on the truck when it does not exceed the weight limit of the bridge?

6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV and reading

Therefore, Jim spends 24 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks."

Tommy collects money for the charity by selling brownies for $3 and cheesecake for $4. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 pieces of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy collect?

Answer: $145.

Explanation:

To find out how much money Tommy collects, we need to multiply the number of brownies sold by the price of each brownie, and then add that amount to the number of cheesecakes sold times the price of each cheesecake.

Number of brownies sold = 43
Price of each brownie = $3
Total amount collected from brownies = 43 x $3 = $135

Number of cheesecakes sold = 23
Price of each cheesecake = $4
Total amount collected from cheesecakes = 23 x $4 = $92

Total amount collected = $135 + $92 = $227

Therefore, Tommy collects $227."

77	if raymond washes half as much laundry as sarah and sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as david, what is the difference between raymond and david washing if sarah washes 400 pounds.	100	"Answer only. 
if raymond washes half as much laundry as sarah and sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as david, what is the difference between raymond and david washing if sarah washes 400 pounds.

Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah washes x pounds, Raymond washes x/2 pounds.

David washes 4 times as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah washes x pounds, David washes 4x pounds.

The problem states that Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry. To find the difference between Raymond and David washing, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry they wash and the amount Sarah washes.

So, the difference between Raymond and David washing is:

Raymond washes x/2 pounds - David washes 4x pounds = (x/2) - 4(x) = -2x/5 pounds."

On Wednesdays, he watches a few 30-minute episodes. On Thursdays, he finishes his homework early and watches an hour and a half episode. If he watched a total of seven hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: 4

x + (x \* 2) = 7

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 7

If he earns $10/hour at his part-time job, then he makes a total of $140/week (14 hours/week x $10/hour).

John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, mugs for $3, and cockroach traps for $4. If there was a 10% tax on all non-food items, how much did everything cost?

Answer: $22.60

Explanation:

Non-food items:

* Milk: $2 (not taxed) = $2
* Eggs: $3 (not taxed) = $3
* Light bulbs: $3 (taxed at 10%) = $3 x 1.10 = $3.30
* Mugs: $3 (not taxed) = $3
* Cockroach traps: $4 (taxed at 10%) = $4 x 1.10 = $4.40

Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $3.30 + $3 + $4.40 = $22.60

Food items:

* Milk: $2 (not taxed) = $2

Total cost of food items = $2

Total cost of everything = $2 + $22.60 = $24.60"

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of marble costs $20 and the price increases 20% from the original price every two months, how much will a bag of marble cost after 36 months?

Answer: $40

Explanation:

After 2 months, the price of a bag of marble will increase by 20%, so it will cost $24 (20% of $20).

After 4 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $28.80 ($24 x 1.20).

After 6 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $33.60 ($28.80 x 1.20).

After 8 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $39.20 ($33.60 x 1.20).

After 10 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $44.80 ($39.20 x 1.20).

After 12 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $50.40 ($44.80 x 1.20).

After 14 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $56.20 ($50.40 x 1.20).

After 16 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $62.40 ($56.20 x 1.20).

After 18 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $68.80 ($62.40 x 1.20).

After 20 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $75.20 ($68.80 x 1.20).

After 22 months, the price will increase by 20% again, so it will cost $81.60 ($75.20 x 1.20)."

There are different toys in a room: 5 red cars, 3 dummies and a doll. A doll costs $4 for up to 3 dummies and a red car. If a dummy costs $5 how much are all the toys worth?

The 3 dummies cost $5 x 3 = $15.

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $12 + $25 + $15 = $55."

The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform with a hat costs $25. A jacket that's three times the size of the hat, and a pair of pants that average the price of the hat and the jacket.

How much will a complete uniform cost?

Explanation:

The hat costs $25.
The jacket is three times the size of the hat, so it costs $25 x 3 = $75.
The pants average the price of the hat and the jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.
Therefore, a complete uniform costs $25 + $75 + $50 = $100."

Two candidates are running for class representative in Sarai School. If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students voting in the class is 80, calculate the number of votes the winner gets.

Answer: 56

Explanation:
Let's say the number of votes the winner gets is x. Since the winner gets 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes the other candidate gets is 4x.

The total number of votes in the class is 80, so the sum of the votes for both candidates is 80.

So, we can set up the equation:
3x + 4x = 80

Simplifying the equation:
7x = 80

Dividing both sides by 7:
x = 11

Therefore, the winner gets 56 votes (3/4 of 11)."

ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. how many pounds of insects per day for a flock of 10 ducks

Answer:
To determine the number of pounds of insects per day for a flock of 10 ducks, we can use the information provided in the problem.

According to the problem, a duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, this means that a duck needs to eat 0.5 pounds of insects per day (3.5 pounds / 7 days).

So, for a flock of 10 ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day would be 0.5 pounds x 10 ducks = 5 pounds of insects per day."

240	James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?	21	"Answer only. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

Let's start by using the information that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.

We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has 2x candies.

Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 6) = 54

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 6 = 54

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

2x = 48

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 24

So, John has 24 more candies than James."

In one pool, there are 4 cormorants, and in another pool, there are 32 cormorants. The difference in the number of cormorants in the two pools is twice the number of fish in the two pools. If both pools had the same number of fish, how many fish would be in each pool?

Posted by: Shruti 19 Jan, 2023
Answer: 16

Explanation:
Let's assume the number of fish in the first pool is x. Since the difference in the number of cormorants is twice the number of fish, the number of cormorants in the first pool is 2x.

In the second pool, the number of fish is 32 - 4 = 28. Since the number of cormorants is equal to the number of fish, the number of cormorants in the second pool is also 28.

So, the number of fish in each pool is 16."
