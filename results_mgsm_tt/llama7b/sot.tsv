Carla downloads a 200 GB file. Usually she can download 2 GB per minute, but 40% of the download is complete. Windows forces a restart to update, which takes 20 minutes. Now Carla has to start the download from scratch. How long does it take to download the file?

Answer: 240 minutes.

Explanation:
Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the file would take 200 GB / 2 GB = 100 minutes to download. Since Windows forced a restart, Carla has to start the download from scratch, which means she has to spend an additional 100 minutes to download the file. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 100 minutes + 100 minutes = 240 minutes."

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph and turns back when he realizes that he has forgotten something important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends 2 hours in stopped traffic. He spends another half hour driving at 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining 4 hours at 80 mph. How far is he home after 4 hours?

Answer: 100 miles

Explanation:

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

When he turns back, he spends 2 hours in stopped traffic, which means he does not cover any distance during this time.

After getting home, he spends another half hour driving at 30 mph, which means he covers a distance of 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles.

Therefore, the total distance John drives after 4 hours is:

180 + 0 + 15 = 195 miles

So, John is 195 miles away from home after 4 hours."
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works in a week is $10. She also earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza has worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works in a week is $10. She also earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza has worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?

Answer: $570

Explanation:
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, so her regular salary for 40 hours of work is $400 ($10/hour x 40 hours).
For the 5 hours of overtime she worked, she earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $12 ($10 x 1.2).
So, her total salary for the week is $400 + $12 = $412.

Therefore, Eliza's salary this week is $570."

The new app had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many total downloads did the app have in three months?

Answer: 210

Explanation:

In the first month, the app had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the number of downloads in the first month, which is 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, in the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, which is 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads. Therefore, the total number of downloads in three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210 downloads."

Carlos plants a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will produce seven lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each. It costs $3 a year to plant and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts making money from the lemon tree?

Answer: 6 years.

Explanation:

First year: $90 (cost of planting) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $93
Second year: $93 (from year 1) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $96
Third year: $96 (from year 2) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $100
Fourth year: $100 (from year 3) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $103
Fifth year: $103 (from year 4) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $106
Sixth year: $106 (from year 5) + $3 (cost of planting and feeding) = $109

In year 6, Carlos will start making money from the lemon tree ($1.50 x 7 lemons = $10.50)."
13	Melanie is a traveling saleswoman. She sold her third vacuum to the green house, two more to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. If Melanie has any vacuums left, how many did she start with?	18	"Answer only. 
Melanie is a traveling saleswoman. She sold her third vacuum to the green house, two more to the red house, and half of what was left to the orange house. If Melanie has any vacuums left, how many did she start with?

Answer: 3

Explanation:

Melanie sold 3 vacuums to the green house, so she had 3 - 3 = 0 vacuums left to sell there.
She sold 2 more vacuums to the red house, so she had 0 - 2 = 1 vacuum left to sell there.
She sold half of what was left to the orange house, which means she sold 1/2 of 1 = 0.5 vacuums to the orange house.
Since Melanie has 0 vacuums left to sell at the green and red houses, and 0.5 vacuums left to sell at the orange house, she started with 3 vacuums."

20	I have 10 gallons of orange juice two thirds of water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice one third of water. But when I pour it, I'm pouring out one gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 gallons of orange juice two thirds of water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice one third of water. But when I pour it, I'm pouring out one gallon of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 gallons?

Answer: 12 gallons

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the amount of orange juice and water in each container:

Orange juice: 10 gallons (two-thirds of 15 gallons)
Water: 15 gallons (one-third of 15 gallons)

When you pour the orange juice into the pineapple juice, you are pouring out one gallon of orange juice. So, after pouring, you have:

Orange juice: 9 gallons (10 gallons - 1 gallon)
Water: 14 gallons (15 gallons - 1 gallon)

Now, let's calculate the amount of water left in 24 gallons:

Water left: 12 gallons (14 gallons - 2 gallons (since 24 gallons is equal to 2 x 12 gallons))

Therefore, there are 12 gallons of water left in 24 gallons."

Answer: 
John runs at a pace of 20 minutes per mile.

Explanation:
John runs for 60 miles in a week, which means he runs for 60/7 = 8.57 hours per week.

He runs for 3 hours on the first day, which means he runs at a pace of 3/2 = 1.5 hours per hour.
He runs for 2 days, which means he runs for 2 x 1.5 = 3 hours at the same pace.
Therefore, John runs at a pace of 20 minutes per mile."

43	According to nutritional information, a bag of crisps has 250 calories per bag. If a 300-gram bag has 5 nutrients, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already eaten 1800 calories?	48	"Answer only. 
According to nutritional information, a bag of crisps has 250 calories per bag. If a 300-gram bag has 5 nutrients, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie intake is 2000 and you have already eaten 1800 calories?

Answer: 30 grams.

Explanation:

To determine how many grams of a nutrient-dense food you can eat within your daily calorie intake, you need to calculate the number of calories from that food in your remaining daily calorie budget.

In this case, you have already eaten 1800 calories, leaving you with a remaining daily calorie budget of 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a bag of crisps has 250 calories per bag, you can eat 200 / 250 = 30 grams of crisps within your remaining daily calorie budget."

A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5,000 kilograms. A freight truck full of identical boxes, each weighing 15 kilograms, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the unladen truck is 3,755 kilograms. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?

Answer: 333 boxes.

Explanation:

First, find the total weight of the truck and the driver: 3,755 kg.

Next, find the weight of the boxes: 15 kg x 333 boxes = 4,955 kg.

Now, compare the total weight of the truck and driver (3,755 kg) to the weight limit of the bridge (5,000 kg):

5,000 kg - 3,755 kg = 1,245 kg.

Therefore, 333 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge."

The basket contains 25 oranges, one bad, 20% unripe, 2 rotten, and all the rest are good. How many good oranges are there?

Answer: 20

Explanation:
The number of good oranges can be calculated by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and rotten oranges from the total number of oranges in the basket.

Total number of oranges = 25
Bad oranges = 1
Unripe oranges = 4 (20% of 25)
Rotten oranges = 2
Good oranges = 25 - 1 - 4 - 2 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 good oranges in the basket."

If Marcy works for the same firm for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of R50,000 per year. Starting after 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Answer: R35,000.

Explanation:

Marcy works for the same firm for 40 years.
Annual pension = R50,000

After 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
Value of pension after 20 years = R50,000 x 5% = R2,500

After 30 years, she quits and is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
Value of pension after 30 years = R50,000 x 5% = R2,500

Annual pension = R50,000 + R2,500 = R32,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension will be R32,500 after she quits after 30 years."

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and decides to go to bed and read for half an hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer: 16 hours

Explanation:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours per session, and he does this 3 times a week. Therefore, he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours per week watching TV.

He then reads for half an hour per session, and he does this 3 times a week as well. Therefore, he spends 0.5 x 3 = 1.5 hours per week reading.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends 6 x 4 = 24 hours watching TV and 1.5 x 4 = 6 hours reading. Therefore, the total time he spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks is 24 + 6 = 30 hours."

Sheila bought five cell phones for R150 each with a three-month installment. 2% interest will be paid for each unit. How much will Sheila pay per month for three months?

Answer: R270 per month.

Explanation:
Sheila bought 5 cell phones for R150 each with a 3-month installment.
The total cost of the cell phones = R150 x 5 = R750.

Total amount paid by Sheila per month = R750 + R45 = R895.
Therefore, Sheila pays R895 per month for 3 months."

If Raymond makes half as much wash as Sarah, and Sarah makes 4 times as much wash as David, calculate the difference in the amount of wash that Raymond and David make if Sarah makes 400 kilograms of wash.

Raymond makes half as much wash as Sarah, so Raymond makes 400 kilograms / 2 = 200 kilograms of wash.

David makes 4 times as much wash as Sarah, so David makes 400 kilograms x 4 = 1600 kilograms of wash.

84	A soccer team has played 22 games and won 8 times as many as they lost. How many did they win?	15	"Answer only. 
A soccer team has played 22 games and won 8 times as many as they lost. How many did they win?

Answer: 8

Explanation:
Let W be the number of games won by the soccer team. Since the team has played 22 games, we can write:

W + L = 22 (1)

We know that the team won 8 times as many games as they lost, so we can write:

W = 8L (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

8L + L = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

9L = 22

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

L = 3

So the team lost 3 games. Therefore, the team won 8 games."

Let's say Herald sold x copies. Since Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Herald, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold by both artists together is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

10x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11, we get:

x = 8,800

Therefore, Herald sold 8,800 copies."

Christina is planning a birthday party and needs 75 gift bags for each guest, because 1/4 of the guests will not come. She has invited 16 friends. Gift bags cost $2. How much will you spend?

Answer: $350

Explanation:
To determine how much you will spend on gift bags, you need to calculate the total number of gift bags you will need. Since 1/4 of the guests will not come, you will need 75 gift bags for the 16 guests who will attend. The cost of each gift bag is $2, so the total cost will be:

75 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $150

Therefore, you will spend $150 on gift bags for Christina's birthday party."

The hospital accepts 500 people a day. The patient is seen for 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make?

Answer: $150 per patient.

Explanation:
The hospital makes $150 per patient, as it charges patients $200 per hour and doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.

Here's the calculation:

$200 (hourly charge to patient) - $150 (hourly charge to hospital) = $50 (profit per hour)

$50 (profit per hour) x 24 (minutes per patient visit) = $1,200 (profit per patient visit)

$1,200 (profit per patient visit) x 500 (number of patients per day) = $600,000 (daily profit)

So, the hospital makes $600,000 in profit per day."

These are the costs she has. She says that in a week she will make $92. The difference between her income and the cost, then how much profit will Lucas make in a week?

Answer: $70

Explanation:

Kim has 5 customers, and each customer's house will need 2 bottles of bleach and a packet of fabric to be cleaned. Therefore, the total cost of cleaning for all 5 customers is:

2 x 5 = $10

Kim is expecting to make $92 in a week, which is the difference between her income and the cost of cleaning:

$92 = $10 + ($5 x 5)

Substituting the values, we get:

$92 = $10 + ($5 x 5)
$92 = $50

So, Lucas will make a profit of $42 in a week ($92 - $50)."
145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple garden. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can plant his pineapples after every 3 months. How many pineapples can John plant in a year?	4000	"Answer only. 
John has 10 hectares of pineapple garden. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can plant his pineapples after every 3 months. How many pineapples can John plant in a year?

Answer: 3000 pineapples

Explanation:

Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, John has 10 hectares of pineapple garden, which means he has 1000 pineapples in total.

John can plant his pineapples after every 3 months, which means he can plant 4 times in a year.

Therefore, John can plant 4 x 1000 = 4000 pineapples in a year.

However, the question asks how many pineapples John can plant in a year, so the answer is 3000 pineapples."

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three one-hour classes. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has two-hour classes a day. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend in classes?

A) 24 hours
B) 30 hours
C) 36 hours
D) 42 hours




Answer: B) 30 hours

Explanation:

Kimo has three one-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which means she spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours in classes on those days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two-hour classes, which means she spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours in classes on those days.

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 3 + 4 = 7 hours in classes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends a total of 7 x 4 = 28 hours in classes per semester.

So, the answer is (B) 30 hours."

In the room there are different toys: 5 red cars, 3 war toys, and a doll. A doll costs 3 war toys and a red car costs $4. How much do all the toys cost if the war toys cost $5?

Answer: $16

Explanation:

The doll costs 3 war toys, so the doll costs $3 \* 3 = $9.
The red cars cost $4 each, so the 5 red cars cost $4 \* 5 = $20.
The total cost of all the toys is $9 + $20 = $29.
If the war toys cost $5, then the total cost of all the toys is $29 + $5 = $34."

There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is eight years old, what is the total number of these birds?

Answer: 32

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

1. There are four birds in Caboose.
2. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four.
4. Sally Four is the same as Sally Thirtytwo.
5. Sally Thirtytwo is eight years old.

Now, let's use the information to find the total number of birds:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is 3 + 3 = 6 years older than Sally Two.
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Sally Four is 2 x 6 = 12 years younger than Granny Red.
3. Sally Four is the same as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Thirtytwo is 4 years younger than Sally Four.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, so Sally Four is 4 + 8 = 12 years old.

Now, let's find the total number of birds:

Total number of birds = Sally Two + Granny Red + Sally Four + Sally Thirtytwo
= 6 + 6 + 12 + 12
= 32

Therefore, there are 32 birds in Caboose."

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. A gallon of lemons costs $3, and a gallon of sugar costs $2. They sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses a gallon. When they make a profit of $25, how much have they spent on lemons?

Answer: $21

Explanation:

Lemons cost $3 per gallon, so Juan and Carlos spend $3 x 20 = $60 on lemons for 20 glasses of lemonade.

Sugar costs $2 per gallon, so they spend $2 x 20 = $40 on sugar for 20 glasses of lemonade.

Total cost = $60 + $40 = $100.

Profit = $25.

So, they have spent $100 on lemons and sugar to make a profit of $25."

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?

Answer: 10 trees

Explanation:
Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees after 1 year.
He cuts down 2 trees a year, so he has 60 - 2 = 58 trees after 2 years.
He has 58 trees for 3 years, then 30% of the trees die, leaving him with 58 x 0.7 = 39 trees after 4 years.
He has 39 trees for 5 years, then 2 trees die, leaving him with 39 - 2 = 37 trees after 6 years.
He has 37 trees for 7 years, then 2 trees die, leaving him with 37 - 2 = 35 trees after 8 years.
He has 35 trees for 9 years, then 2 trees die, leaving him with 35 - 2 = 33 trees after 10 years.
Therefore, there are 33 trees left after 10 years."

200 kilograms of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a city. Each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many kilograms of carrots are not to be used?

Answer: 160 kilograms

Explanation:

Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 200 kilograms
Number of restaurants to receive carrots = 40
Amount of carrots each restaurant will receive = 2 pounds = 0.9 kilograms

So, the amount of carrots not to be used = Total amount of carrots - Amount of carrots each restaurant will receive = 200 kilograms - (40 x 0.9 kilograms) = 160 kilograms"

Mark is a speech editor. He edits the same number of sentences for two different publishers, each of whom pays him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make per week?

Answer: $50

Explanation:
Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for Publisher A, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes $50 per week from Publisher A.

For Publisher B, Mark edits twice as many sentences, so he edits 2000 sentences per week. Since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, he makes $10 per sentence from Publisher B. Therefore, he makes $2000 per week from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes $500 per week ($50 from Publisher A + $2000 from Publisher B)."

Answer: $1200

If 12 copies cost $200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, then the total cost of purchasing each copy is:

$6,000 - $200 = $5,800

So, the total cost of purchasing each copy is $5,800."

James counts his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 vegetable cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 vegetable cards and buys 14 vegetable cards, what is the probability that the water card will be selected?

Answer: 0.33

Explanation:

Total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 vegetable cards, the number of vegetable cards left = 20 - 8 = 12

Mark parks 12 cars for his company. He sells each car for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on cars and $1,000 registration fee for each car. How much money does he charge?

Mark parks 12 cars for his company. He sells each car for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on cars and $1,000 registration fee for each car. How much money does he charge?

Total revenue = Number of cars x Selling price per car
Total revenue = 12 x $20,000
Total revenue = $240,000

Tax = Total revenue x Tax rate (10%)
Tax = $240,000 x 10%
Tax = $24,000

Total revenue after tax = Total revenue - Tax
Total revenue after tax = $240,000 - $24,000
Total revenue after tax = $216,000

Registration fee = Total revenue after tax x Registration fee per car
Registration fee = $216,000 x $1,000
Registration fee = $216,000

So, Mark charges a total of $216,000 for parking and selling the 12 cars."

Steve can finish eating more tomatoes and planting his cherry tomatoes. He eats more than his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If the garden produces 3 tomatoes a week, how many gardens does he need?

Answer: 2

Explanation:

The hall had 3 doors, A, B, and C, through which they left. If after the meeting 30% of the students left through door A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, and the remaining students left through door C, add up the number of students who left through door C.

Answer: 20

Explanation:

Let the total number of students in the hall be x.

After the meeting, 30% of the students left through door A, so the number of students who left through door A is 0.3x = 30x/100.

3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, so the number of students who left through door B is 3/5 \* (x - 30x/100) = 15x/100.

The remaining students left through door C, so the number of students who left through door C is x - 0.3x - 15x/100 = 14x/100.

Therefore, the total number of students who left through door C is 14x/100."

Each person sends 2 letters a week of 5 pages each. He responds kindly. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours does it take him to write a page a week?

Answer: 1 hour

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Each person sends 2 letters a week of 5 pages each.
* He responds kindly.
* He can write a page in 6 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many hours it takes him to write a page a week:

1 hour = 60 minutes

So, to write 5 pages in a week, he needs to spend:

5 pages x 60 minutes/page = 300 minutes

Therefore, it takes him 300 minutes to write a page a week, which is equal to 5 hours."

Jason has 1,000 phone minutes a month. Every day he calls his boss for 15 minutes, and he had an extra 300 minutes to call other people this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?

Answer: 700 minutes

Explanation:

Jason has 1,000 minutes a month.

He calls his boss for 15 minutes every day, which is 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.

He has an extra 300 minutes to call other people.

So, Jason has 1,000 - 450 = 550 minutes left for other calls.

Since this month has 30 days, Jason has 550 / 30 = 18 minutes left per day."

There are 4 turtles in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the number of turtles in two aquariums is twice the number of fish in two aquariums. When these two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish in each aquarium.

Answer: 8

Explanation:
Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium x.

From the problem, we know that there are 4 turtles in one aquarium and 32 turtles in the other. So, the difference between the number of turtles in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

We also know that the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of turtles. So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 2x.

Since the two aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up the equation:

2x = x + 28

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 fish in each aquarium."

Jean's makeup artist charges R250 per hour. She needs expensive makeup for the film she is starring in and it takes 6 hours to do it every day, and she needs to do it 4 times a week. The film will end after 5 weeks. After the film is over, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount for the work done. How much has Jean hidden?

Answer: R2000

Explanation:

Jean needs makeup for 5 weeks, and she needs to do it 4 times a week. So, she needs makeup for a total of 20 weeks (5 weeks x 4 times a week).

The makeup artist charges R250 per hour, so Jean needs to pay:

R250 x 20 weeks = R5000

After the film is over, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so Jean needs to pay:

R5000 x 0.9 = R4500

Therefore, Jean has hidden R4500."

Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $104

Each person spent half of the total amount spent, so:

Isabelle spent $104 / 2 = $52
Her parents spent $104 / 2 = $52

Therefore, Isabelle spent $52 and her parents spent $52."

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cakes as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cakes as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cakes on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cake has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her sister?

Answer: 1200 calories.

Explanation:
Sue ate 4 times as many cakes as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cakes, and her sister ate 5 cakes.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cakes as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cakes, and her sister ate 13 cakes.
The total number of cakes Sue ate more than her sister is 20 + 26 = 46 cakes.
Since each cake has 200 calories, the total number of calories Sue ate more than her sister is 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.
Therefore, Sue ate 9200 calories more than her sister."
