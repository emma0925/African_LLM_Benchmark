Kylar goes to the store to buy glass for her new house. One glass costs $5, but all the other glasses are 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does she need to tell them?

Answer: $128

Explanation:

To find the price of 16 glasses, we need to calculate 60% of the price of one glass.

60% of $5 = $3

So, the price of 16 glasses is $16 x $3 = $48

Therefore, Kylar needs to tell the store $48 to buy 16 glasses."

John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph and then turned around because he realized that he had forgotten something important about home. He tried to get home at 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours waiting and getting close. He then spent the next half hour driving at 30 mph, only to find that he drove the rest of the 4 hours at 80 mph. How far was he from home at the end of the 4 hours?

Answer: 2 hours

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, which means he traveled 3 x 60 = 180 miles.
* He then turned around and tried to get home, but spent the first 2 hours waiting and getting close. This means he traveled 2 x 60 = 120 miles.
* He then spent the next half hour driving at 30 mph, which means he traveled 0.5 x 60 = 30 miles.
* Finally, he drove the rest of the 4 hours at 80 mph, which means he traveled 4 x 80 = 320 miles.

Adding up all these distances, John was 380 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours."
9	Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She also charged overtime 1.2 times her regular rate. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she make this week?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She also charged overtime 1.2 times her regular rate. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she make this week?

I need help solving this problem. Can you please explain how to approach it?

Answer: $450

Explanation:

To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular hourly rate and then multiply it by the number of hours she worked. Then, we can multiply that total by 1.2 to find her overtime earnings. Finally, we add her regular and overtime earnings together to get her total weekly earnings.

Regular hourly rate: $10/hour x 40 hours = $400
Overtime rate: $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour
Total hours worked: 45 hours
Total earnings: $400 + ($45 x $12) = $450

Therefore, Eliza made $450 this week."

I have 10 gallons of pineapple juice which is two thirds water and I want to pour it into 15 gallons of pineapple juice which is three fifths water. But as I pour it, I leave one gallon of pineapple juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 gallons?

Answer: 6 gallons

Let's first calculate the amount of pineapple juice in the 15 gallons of pineapple juice which is three fifths water.

15 gallons x 3/5 = 7.5 gallons of pineapple juice

Now, let's calculate the amount of water left in the remaining 24 gallons.

24 gallons - 7.5 gallons = 16.5 gallons of water

So, there are 6 gallons of water left in the remaining 24 gallons."

39	Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, but she can jump at a speed half as fast as she can run. If she can fly at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she walk in six hours if she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time?

Answer: 2 miles

Explanation:
Dana can run at a speed twice as fast as she can walk, so she can walk at a speed of half the speed of running. If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 3 miles per hour.

Since she wants to spend one-third of her running time and two-thirds of her walking time, she will spend 2/3 of 6 hours running and 1/3 of 6 hours walking.

The total time she spends walking is 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 miles."

According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips contains 250 calories in one serving. If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories?

Answer: 125g

Explanation:
To determine how many grams of chips you would eat if your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already eaten 1800 calories, we need to calculate how many calories are in one serving of chips (250 calories) and then divide that number by the number of calories you have already eaten (1800 calories).

So, 250 calories / 1800 calories = 0.135 or 13.5% of your daily calorie goal.

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips, you would eat 13.5% of 300g = 39.5g of chips.

Rounding up to the nearest gram, you would eat 40g of chips."
44	Charlie wants to sell a honeycomb. For every pound of gold in a honeycomb, he can get 10 small honeycombs. A pound of honey and honeycomb is $10.00 each. If he sells each honeycomb for $2.00, what is the total profit if he makes and sells 20 honeycombs?	20	"Answer only. 
Charlie wants to sell a honeycomb. For every pound of gold in a honeycomb, he can get 10 small honeycombs. A pound of honey and honeycomb is $10.00 each. If he sells each honeycomb for $2.00, what is the total profit if he makes and sells 20 honeycombs?

Answer: $20.00

Explanation:

To calculate the total profit, we need to first calculate the total value of the honeycombs that Charlie can make and sell. Since each honeycomb weighs 1 pound, and each pound of honey and honeycomb costs $10.00, the total value of 20 honeycombs is:

20 honeycombs x $10.00 per pound = $200.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of making and selling the honeycombs. Since Charlie can make 10 small honeycombs for every pound of gold in a honeycomb, and each small honeycomb costs $2.00 to make, the total cost of making and selling 20 honeycombs is:

20 honeycombs x $2.00 per small honeycomb = $40.00

So, the total profit from selling 20 honeycombs is:

$200.00 - $40.00 = $160.00

Therefore, the total profit is $160.00."

John bought twice as many red teas as the green tea. The red tea was 50% more expensive than the green tea. He spent $200 on the green tea which was $40 each. How much did he spend on the tea?

Answer: $160

Explanation:

John bought twice as many red tea as green tea, so he bought 2 x 200 = 400 red tea bags.

The red tea was 50% more expensive than the green tea, so the cost of 1 red tea bag = $200 / 2 = $100.

Therefore, John spent $100 x 400 = $40,000 on red tea."

Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. As her pet sitter, she has to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food a day for the first 180 days. Then she has to give the puppy 2 cups of dog food a day for the rest of her life. If a dog food bag has 110 cups, how many dog food bags will Cecilia use in the first year?

Answer: 18 bags

Explanation:

In the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day, so she will use 180 cups of dog food (1 cup/day x 180 days). Since a dog food bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will use 7 bags of dog food in the first 180 days (180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 7 bags).

Therefore, Cecilia will use a total of 18 bags of dog food in the first year (7 bags x 180 days + 18 bags)."

A company pays each of its employees $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salary of each of its employees by 10% of the first salary per year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years in the company last October, what is her salary per year after spending three more years on the job?

Answer: $7200

Explanation:
Sylvie's salary per year before spending three more years on the job is $600 x 5 = $3000.
Since the company increases the salary of each of its employees by 10% of the first salary per year, Sylvie's salary after spending three more years on the job will be $3000 x 10% = $300.

Ted is trying to bring a salad bar to a dinner party. He knows that an adult dinner party eats 10 ibs of salad bar while a baby eats half as much as an adult. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the dinner party, how many salad bars does Ted have to bring to the dinner party if he decides to have enough for everyone?

Answer: 10 salad bars

Explanation:

Since an adult dinner party eats 10 ibs of salad bar, and there are 20 adults at the dinner party, Ted needs to bring 20 x 10 = 200 ibs of salad bar.

Since a baby eats half as much as an adult, a baby at the dinner party eats 10/2 = 5 ibs of salad bar. Since there are 5 children at the dinner party, Ted needs to bring 5 x 5 = 25 ibs of salad bar for the children.

In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 ibs of salad bar to the dinner party."

Out of 200 fifth graders, two-fifths are male while two-thirds are female in scouts, how many women are not in scouts?

Answer: 30

Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of women in Scouts.

Two-thirds of the fifth graders are female, so the number of female fifth graders is 2/3 x 200 = 133.

Now, we need to find out how many of these female fifth graders are in Scouts. Two-fifths of the female fifth graders are male, so the number of male fifth graders is 2/5 x 133 = 66.

Therefore, the number of women who are not in Scouts is 133 - 66 = 67."

A few of the cars entered in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, 20 more cars entered in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 of the cars in the line left to enter the traffic jam. If there are 30 cars on the road, how many cars can pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Answer: 10 cars

Explanation:

Let's assume that the traffic jam started at time = 0. In the first 15 minutes, 10 cars entered the traffic jam (since 10 cars entered in the first 15 minutes).

In the last 15 minutes, 20 cars entered the traffic jam (since 20 cars entered in the last 15 minutes).

Since 5 cars left the line, the total number of cars in the line after 15 minutes is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

Therefore, the number of cars that can pass through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 cars."

Clouds rise from the sea to cover the entire city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across the sea to the other side of the country, how many minutes would it take for the cloud to cover the entire city?

Answer: 420 minutes

Explanation:

The cloud covers the entire city in 10 minutes for every 3 miles of the city. So, to cover 42 miles, it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, it will take 14 minutes to cover 42 miles. Therefore, it will take 420 minutes (or 7 hours) for the cloud to cover the entire city."

The boat sails while afloat. The boat drinks two liters of water for every foot when it returns to port. It takes about 16 minutes to cross 20 feet. The port is 64 minutes away. How much water has the boat dragged by the time Julia arrives at the port?

Answer: 10 liters

Explanation:

The boat sails while afloat, so it is not in a state of drinking water.

The boat travels at a rate of 1 foot per 16 minutes, so it takes 20 feet to cross 20 feet.

The distance to the port is 64 minutes away, so the boat travels at a rate of 1 foot per 64 minutes.

Therefore, the boat has dragged 10 liters of water by the time Julia arrives at the port."

A classroom has a whiteboard that is divided among 4 teachers who take turns to use the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is turned off 3 times in each lesson, how many times is the whiteboard turned off during the day?

Answer: 12 times

Explanation:
Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and each lesson has the whiteboard turned off 3 times. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is turned off in a day is 2 x 2 = 4 times. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is turned off in a day is 4 x 4 = 16 times. However, since each teacher uses the whiteboard twice in a day, the total number of times the whiteboard is turned off is actually 12 times."

Jamal's telescope can take 6 times more pictures than Brittany's telescope. Brittany's telescope can take 50 times more pictures than Jamal's bird in the zoo. If Jamal's telescope can take 1800 pictures, how many birds can we see in Jamal's bird in the zoo?

Answer: 180

Explanation:
Jamal's telescope can take 6 times more pictures than Brittany's telescope, so Jamal's telescope can take 6 x 1800 = 10800 pictures.
Brittany's telescope can take 50 times more pictures than Jamal's bird in the zoo, so Brittany's telescope can take 50 x 180 = 900 pictures.
Therefore, the total number of pictures taken by both telescopes is 10800 + 900 = 11700 pictures.
Since Jamal's bird in the zoo can hold 180 birds, we can see 11700 / 180 = 65 birds in Jamal's bird in the zoo."

A hospital sees 500 people a day. The average time it takes to respond to a patient is 24 hours. Doctors make $150 an hour from the hospital, and the hospital makes $200 an hour from the patients. How much money does the hospital make from scans?

A) $150 per scan
B) $200 per scan
C) $250 per scan
D) $300 per scan

Answer: B) $200 per scan.

Explanation:

The hospital makes $200 an hour from each patient, and it takes 24 hours to respond to a patient. So, the hospital makes $200 x 24 = $4800 per patient.

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, the total amount of money the hospital makes per day is $4800 x 500 = $240,000.

Since the hospital performs 10 scans per day, the total amount of money the hospital makes per day from scans is $240,000 x 10 = $240,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $200 per scan."

136	There are only 27 unicorns left in the world. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. How many female Scottish unicorns are there?	6	"Answer only. 
There are only 27 unicorns left in the world. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. How many female Scottish unicorns are there?

Answer: 17

Explanation:
Let X be the number of female Scottish unicorns.
Since two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, the number of female unicorns is 2/3X.
The total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is 1/3X.
We are given that there are only 27 unicorns left in the world, so 1/3X + 2/3X = 27.
Solving for X, we get X = 17.
Therefore, there are 17 female Scottish unicorns."

Shawnda decided that her neighborhood needed a tire repair shop. She decided that the best way to charge for each tire would be 25 cents per tire. On the first day, five people on a bike came to ask for two tires. Three people came to ask for all five of their tires. Finally, one person came to her with a bicycle. How many dollars did she lose that day?

Answer: $1.75.

Explanation:

* Five people on a bike came to ask for two tires, so they needed 10 tires in total.
* Three people came to ask for all five of their tires, so they needed 5 tires in total.
* One person came to her with a bicycle, so they needed 1 tire.

Total number of tires needed that day = 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 tires.

Shawnda charged $0.25 per tire, so the total amount of money Shawnda lost that day = $16 x $0.25 = $4.

Therefore, Shawnda lost $4 that day."

How long will it take billy to finish the knives?

Answer: 
It will take Billy 60 minutes to finish cutting the knives.

Explanation:

To find out how long it will take Billy to finish cutting the knives, we need to multiply the number of knives by the time it takes him to cut one knife. Since it takes Billy about a minute and a half to cut a knife, and he needs to cut 60 knives, it will take him 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes to finish cutting all the knives."

Two candidates are competing for class representation at Sarai School. If the winner receives 3/4 of the votes, out of a total of 80 students in the class, calculate the number of votes the loser received.

Answer: 16

Explanation:
Let the number of votes the winner received be x. Since the winner receives 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes the loser received is equal to 80 - x.

We know that the total number of votes is 80, so we can set up the equation:

x + (80 - x) = 3/4 \* 80

Simplifying the equation:

Mandy owes Benedict $100. They have an agreement that she will get 2% interest every month. If Mandy can pay it after three months, how much should she give Benedict?

Answer: $102

Explanation:

Mandy owes Benedict $100.
Interest for the first month = $100 x 2% = $2
Interest for the second month = $100 x 2% = $2
Interest for the third month = $100 x 2% = $2
Total interest = $6

New amount owed = $100 + $6 = $106
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after three months."
188	A merchant buys a few sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry each sack from the farm to the store, and the merchant makes $400 in total after selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A merchant buys a few sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs $2 to carry each sack from the farm to the store, and the merchant makes $400 in total after selling all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 7 sacks.

Explanation:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find the total cost of carrying all the sacks from the farm to the store. Since it costs $2 to carry each sack, the total cost of carrying all the sacks is:

$2 x number of sacks = $2 x 7 sacks

So, the merchant made $400 in total after selling all the sacks for $30 a sack. Let's use this information to find the number of sacks sold:

Total amount earned = Number of sacks sold x Price per sack
= $400 x $30
= 12 sacks

Since we already know the merchant sold 7 sacks, we can subtract 7 from 12 to find the number of sacks he sold:

12 - 7 = 5 sacks

Therefore, the merchant sold 5 sacks of wheat."

Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in five different colors and is prepared to pay $20 for this purchase. One crayon is $2. How much more will she get?

Answer: $18

Explanation:

Violetta wants to buy new crayons in five different colors. Let's assume the cost of each crayon is $2.

To find out how much more Violetta will get, we need to subtract the cost of the crayons she wants to buy from the amount she is prepared to pay:

$20 - ($2 x 5) = $18

Therefore, Violetta will get $18 more than she expected."

On Good Friday, Rose bought 4 white breads.
On Victory Day, she bought 3 times as many breads, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 white breads.
On Labor Day, she bought 5 times as many breads as she did on Victory Day, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 white breads.
In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 white breads."

Twelve cups sold for $1200 less than six cans sold for $6,000 each. Calculate the price of each cup

A) $50
B) $75
C) $100
D) $150
E) $200

Answer: B) $75

Explanation:

We are given that twelve cups sold for $1200 less than six cans sold for $6000 each.

Let's call the price of each can $x.

Then, the price of twelve cups = $6000 x 12 = $72000.

So, the price of each cup = $72000 / 12 = $6000 / 12 = $500.

Therefore, the answer is (B) $75."

Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Answer: 4

Explanation:
Let's assume the number of red chickens is x.

Since the red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x.

Since the white chickens lay less than 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is less than 5x.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by both red and white chickens is 3x + 5x = 8x = 36 eggs a day.

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is 2x + 2 = 4x.

So, the number of red chickens is x = 4."

Jean was paid $250 an hour by a jean artist. She needed a very expensive cut for the film she was in and it took six hours to make every day and it needed to be made four times a week. The film took five weeks to complete. After the film was made the artist gave Jean a 10% discount for the amount of work done. What did Jean pay?

Answer: $10,800.

Explanation:

Jean was paid $250 per hour for her work as a jean artist. Since the artist needed to make four sets of expensive cuts for the film, it took six hours per day to make each set, for a total of 24 hours per week. Since the film took five weeks to complete, Jean had to make 4 x 24 = 96 hours of expensive cuts.

Since the artist gave Jean a 10% discount for the amount of work done, Jean paid $96 x 0.9 = $87.20 per set of expensive cuts. Since there were four sets of expensive cuts, Jean paid a total of $87.20 x 4 = $348.80 per week.

Since the film took five weeks to complete, Jean paid a total of $348.80 x 5 = $1,744 per film."
