A new app was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but fell by 30% in the third month. How many times was the app downloaded in total during the three months?

Answer: 210

Explanation:

In the first month, the app was downloaded 60 times.
In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the number of downloads in the first month, so the app was downloaded 60 x 3 = 180 times.
In the third month, the number of downloads fell by 30%, so the app was downloaded 180 x 0.7 = 126 times.

Therefore, the app was downloaded a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 216 times during the three months."

A trader wants to make a purchase choice between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will rise to 2.5% while the electronics market will rise to 1.2% within the same month. If the trader wants to have the highest profits by the end of this month by making an option, how much profit will this be?

Answer: $1,300.

Explanation:
The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5% within the same month, which means that the value of the jewelry will increase by $125 (2.5% of $5,000). Therefore, the trader will be able to sell the jewelry for $5,125 ($5,000 + $125) at the end of the month.

On the other hand, the electronics market is expected to rise by 1.2% within the same month, which means that the value of the electronics will increase by $96 (1.2% of $8,000). Therefore, the trader will be able to sell the electronics for $8,996 ($8,000 + $96) at the end of the month.

Since the trader wants to have the highest profits by the end of the month, he will choose to purchase the jewelry, which will result in a profit of $1,300 ($5,125 - $5,000)."

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water and I would prefer to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three thirds water. But when I pour it, I have poured out one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice that is two thirds water and I would prefer to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three thirds water. But when I pour it, I have poured out one liter of orange juice. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Answer: 15 liters

Explanation:

The total volume of orange juice is 10 liters, and it is two thirds water, so the volume of water in the orange juice is 10/3 = 3.33 liters.

The total volume of pineapple juice is 15 liters, and it is three thirds water, so the volume of water in the pineapple juice is 15/3 = 5 liters.

When you mix the orange juice and pineapple juice, the total volume of liquid is 10 + 5 = 15 liters.

Since you poured out one liter of orange juice, the remaining volume of orange juice is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Therefore, the water content in the remaining 24 liters of liquid is 9/24 = 1/3 = 0.33 liters."

27	Cynthia eats one piece of ice cream every night. She buys boxes of ice cream containing 15 pieces at $4.00 each. After 60 days, how much money will she have spent on ice cream?	16	"Answer only. 
Cynthia eats one piece of ice cream every night. She buys boxes of ice cream containing 15 pieces at $4.00 each. After 60 days, how much money will she have spent on ice cream?

Answer: $240.00

Explanation:
Cynthia eats one piece of ice cream every night, so she eats 60 pieces of ice cream in 60 days. Since each box of ice cream contains 15 pieces, Cynthia will have bought 60/15 = 4 boxes of ice cream in 60 days.

The cost of each box of ice cream is $4.00, so Cynthia will have spent $4.00 x 4 = $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days.

Therefore, the total amount of money Cynthia will have spent on ice cream in 60 days is $16.00 x 60 = $960.00."

Therefore, Terry spends a total of $60.00 on milkshakes over a 30-day period (60 milkshakes x $5.00 per 4 milkshakes)."

Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can jump only half as fast. If she can jump three miles an hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends a third of an hour running and two thirds of an hour walking?

Answer: 4.5 miles

Explanation:
Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, so if she can run 4 miles per hour, she can walk 1 mile per hour.

If she jumps 3 miles per hour, she can walk 3 miles per hour.

If she spends a third of an hour running and two thirds of an hour walking, she will run for 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours and walk for 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours.

So, she will travel a total distance of 2 + 4 = 6 miles in 6 hours."

By the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces, there were 14 pieces of cake left over. How many pieces did the guests eat?

40 pieces of cake - 14 pieces left over = 26 pieces eaten by the guests

Therefore, the guests ate 26 pieces of cake."

According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300 - gram bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2,000 and you have already eaten 1,800 calories?




Answer:
You can eat 100 grams of chips.

Explanation:
To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, you need to subtract the number of calories you have already eaten from your daily calorie target. In this case, you have already eaten 1,800 calories, which is more than half of your daily target of 2,000 calories. Therefore, you can eat 200 grams of chips (2,000 - 1,800 = 200). However, since each serving is 50 grams, you can only eat 100 grams of chips in one sitting."

Uriah's book bag becomes too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from the bag. His futon books weigh 1/4 pound each and his dolls weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 futon books, how many dolls does he need to remove?

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. Each futon book weighs 1/4 pound, so removing 30 futon books will remove 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds from the bag. Since each doll weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 dollars from the bag. Therefore, he needs to remove 20 dolls from the bag."

Sophia is considering taking a trip in her own car, and she would like to know how far she can travel on one tank of gasoline. She has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to fill her tank again. Her car's manual says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophia drive on one tank of gasoline?

Answer: 

Miles = (Tank capacity - Amount of gasoline added) / Gasoline consumption per mile

In this case, the tank capacity is 12 gallons, the amount of gasoline added is 4 gallons, and the gasoline consumption per mile is 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 12 gallons / 25 miles per gallon = 480 miles on one tank of gasoline."

Judy teaches 5 dance classes, daily, weekdays and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?

Answer: $12,900.00

Explanation:
Judy teaches 5 classes daily, Monday through Friday, for a total of 25 classes per week (5 x 5).
She teaches 8 classes on Saturdays, for a total of 8 classes per week (8 x 1).
The total number of classes Judy teaches per week is 33 classes (25 + 8).
If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, the total number of students Judy teaches per week is 33 classes x 15 students per class = 495 students per week (33 x 15).
The total amount of money Judy makes in one week is 495 students per week x $15.00 per student = $7,325.00 per week (495 x 15).
Therefore, Judy makes $12,900.00 per week ($7,325.00 x 1.75)."

For the cheesecakes, Tommy sold 23 slices at $4 per slice, so he raised $92 ($23 x $4).
In total, Tommy raised $224 ($132 + $92) from selling the cakes.
Therefore, Tommy donated $224 to the charity."

77	If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David does, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do with Sarah washing 400 pounds of laundry.	100	"Answer only. 
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David does, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do with Sarah washing 400 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah does, so Raymond does 1/2 x 400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
David does less laundry than Raymond, so David does 200 - 400 = -200 pounds of laundry.

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do with Sarah washing 400 pounds of laundry is 200 - 200 = 0 pounds."

88	Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies in all, how many did Harald sell?	8000	"Answer only. 
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies in all, how many did Harald sell?

Answer: 8800

Explanation:

Let's assume that Marilyn sold x copies. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold by both artists is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

Marilyn's copies = 10x
Harald's copies = 88,000 - 10x

Solving for Harald's copies, we get:

Harald's copies = 88,000 - 10x
= 88,000 - 10(8800)
= 88,000 - 8800
= 79,200

Therefore, Harald sold 79,200 copies."

The hospital treats 500 people a day. Each patient is treated for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. How much money does the hospital make from these trips?

Answer: $12,000 per day.

Explanation:

To calculate the amount of money the hospital makes from these trips, we need to multiply the number of patients treated per day by the average time each patient is treated.

500 patients per day x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes per day

Since doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, we can calculate the total amount of money made by the hospital as follows:

12,000 minutes per day x $150 per hour = $180,000 per day

However, the hospital only charges patients $200 per hour, so the actual amount of money made by the hospital is:

$180,000 per day x $200 per hour = $12,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital makes $12,000 per day from these trips."

There are only 27 horses left in the world. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two thirds of French Scots are female. How many Scottish females are there?

Answer: 18

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* There are only 27 horses left in the world.
* One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.
* Two thirds of French Scots are female.

Now, let's use these facts to find the number of Scottish females:

1. One third of 27 horses are in the Scottish Highlands, which means 9 horses are in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Two thirds of French Scots are female, which means 17 French Scots are female.
3. Since French Scots are a subset of Scottish Scots, the number of Scottish females is equal to the number of French Scots who are female.

Therefore, there are 18 Scottish females."

141	There are 700 bees in a hive. The number of worker bees is twice that of the queen bee, and the number of queen bees is three times that of the queen bee. How many worker bees are there?	400	"Answer only. 
There are 700 bees in a hive. The number of worker bees is twice that of the queen bee, and the number of queen bees is three times that of the queen bee. How many worker bees are there?

Answer: 1400

Explanation:
Let the number of queen bees be Q.
Since the number of queen bees is three times that of the queen bee, the number of worker bees is twice that of the queen bee.
So, the number of worker bees is 2Q.

According to the problem, the number of bees in the hive is 700.
So, the number of worker bees is 2Q = 2(700) = 1400.

Therefore, there are 1400 worker bees in the hive."
142	Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. He also has a part-time job that pays $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games working?	140	"Answer only. 
Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. He also has a part-time job that pays $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games working?

Answer: $35

To find out how much money Jordan would make in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends playing video games by the amount he earns per hour. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, which means he spends 14 hours playing video games per week (7 days x 2 hours/day). If he earns $10 per hour working his part-time job, then he would make $140 per week (14 hours/week x $10/hour). Therefore, Jordan would make $140 + $35 = $175 per week if he spent his time playing video games working."

John buys the milk for $2, the eggs for $3, the incandescent bulbs for $3, the cups for $3, and the bug traps for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, what was the total cost?

Total cost = $

Answer: $16

Explanation:

John buys the following items:

* Milk: $2

$16 x 10% = $1.60

Total cost = $16 + $1.60 = $17.60"

The profit is the difference between total revenue and total utility costs, so how much profit, in dollars, will Kim make per week?

Answer: $60.

Explanation:
Total revenue = $92 (from 3 customers) + $92 (from 5 additional customers) = $184
Total utility costs = $2 x 2 = $4 (chlorine for 3 customers) + $5 x 5 = $25 (cloths for 5 customers) = $79
Profit = $184 - $79 = $105
Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $105 per week."

162	If the price of a marble bag is $20 and that price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, what will the price of the marble bag be after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If the price of a marble bag is $20 and that price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, what will the price of the marble bag be after 36 months?

Price of marble bag = $20

Price increase = 20% of original price

Price increase after 2 months = $20 x 20% = $4

Price of marble bag after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Price increase after 4 months = $24 x 20% = $4.8

Price of marble bag after 4 months = $24 + $4.8 = $28.8

Price increase after 6 months = $28.8 x 20% = $5.76

Price of marble bag after 6 months = $28.8 + $5.76 = $34.56

Price increase after 8 months = $34.56 x 20% = $6.91

Price of marble bag after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Price increase after 10 months = $41.47 x 20% = $8.29

Price of marble bag after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $50.76

Price increase after 12 months = $50.76 x 20% = $10.15

Price of marble bag after 12 months = $50.76 + $10.15 = $60.91

Therefore, the price of the marble bag after 36 months will be $60.91."

Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay off each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300 a month, her credit cards have a minimum payment of $200 a month, and her mortgage has a minimum payment of $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay off in a year?

Jessica pays $300 per month on her student loans, $200 per month on her credit cards, and $500 per month on her mortgage. To find out how much she pays off in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12.

Total monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000
Total annual payment = $1000 x 12 = $12,000

Therefore, Jessica pays off $12,000 in a year by paying 50% more than the minimum payments on her student loans, credit cards, and mortgage."

180	Two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai School. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students voting in the class was 80, count the number of votes the loser got.	20	"Answer only. 
Two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai School. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students voting in the class was 80, count the number of votes the loser got.

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let the number of votes the loser got be x.

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes the winner got is 3/4 x.

We know that the total number of votes cast was 80, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3/4 x = 80

Simplifying the equation:

5/4 x = 80

Dividing both sides by 5/4:

x = 20

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes."

Using this information, which team with the fastest run will win by how many seconds?

Answer:
The team with the fastest run will win by 20 seconds.

Explanation:
The team with the best runners will run their 400-meter course in 55 seconds per runner, for a total time of 220 seconds (55 x 4).

The other team's first runner will run their 400-meter course in 60 seconds, and each of the next three runners will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, so their total time will be:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 262 seconds

Therefore, the team with the fastest run will win by 20 seconds (262 - 220)."

Answer: 13 bags.

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the total cost of transporting all the bags from the field to the warehouse:

$2 x 13 bags = $26

Now, let's calculate the profit made by the seller after selling all the bags:

$400 - $26 = $374

So, the seller made a profit of $374 after selling 13 bags. Therefore, the number of bags sold is 13."

192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he also cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year he also cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?

Answer:
After 10 years, Tom has 35 trees left.

Explanation:

Tom starts with 50 trees.

Year 1: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees.

Year 2: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 60 - 2 = 58 trees.

Year 3: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 58 + 10 = 68 trees.

Year 4: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 68 - 2 = 66 trees.

Year 5: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 66 + 10 = 76 trees.

Year 6: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 76 - 2 = 74 trees.

Year 7: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 74 + 10 = 84 trees.

Year 8: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 84 - 2 = 82 trees.

Year 9: Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 82 + 10 = 92 trees.

Year 10: Tom cuts down 2 trees, so he has 92 - 2 = 90 trees.

After 10 years, Tom has 90 trees left.

So, Tom has 35 trees left after 10 years."

Two hundred pounds of carrots is enough to distribute to 40 restaurants in a city. Each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 190 pounds

Explanation:
Let's first calculate the total amount of carrots needed to distribute to all 40 restaurants:
40 restaurants x 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds
Now, we know that 200 pounds of carrots are available, so the amount of carrots that will not be used is:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds
Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."

If Sara already had a $10 savings before she started checking on the neighbor's kids, how many times will she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: 8 times

Explanation:
Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $40. In total, she wants to spend $70.

Since Sara earns $5 each time she checks on her neighbor's kids, she will need to check on them 14 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. ($70 - $10 = $60 / $5 = 14 times)

Therefore, Sara will need to mow the lawn 8 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."

Callie solves a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Callie can usually add 4 pieces in a minute. Her mother can basically do half of what Callie can do in a minute. How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?

240	James has 6 more sweets than Robert. John has twice as many sweets as Robert. If John has 54 sweets, how many sweets does John have more than James?	21	"Answer only. 
James has 6 more sweets than Robert. John has twice as many sweets as Robert. If John has 54 sweets, how many sweets does John have more than James?

Answer: 24

Explanation:

Let's first find out how many sweets James has. Since James has 6 more sweets than Robert, James has 6 + 2 = 8 more sweets than Robert.

So, Robert has 54 - 8 = 46 sweets.

Now, we know that John has twice as many sweets as Robert, so John has 2 x 46 = 92 sweets.

Finally, we subtract the number of sweets James has from the number of sweets John has to find out how many sweets John has more than James: 92 - 46 = 24.

Therefore, John has 24 more sweets than James."

Since Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, he can write 5 pages in 30 minutes (6 minutes per page x 5 pages). Therefore, he spends 30 minutes writing letters each week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Mike spends 10 hours (30 minutes x 7 days) writing letters each week."
