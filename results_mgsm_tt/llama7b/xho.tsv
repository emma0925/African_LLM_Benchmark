Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. And she earns 1.2 times her normal hourly rate for overtime. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, what is her salary this week?

Answer: $570.

Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10, so her total earnings for those hours is $400 (40 hours x $10/hour).
For the 5 hours she worked overtime, her overtime rate is 1.2 times her normal hourly rate, so her earnings for those hours is $12 (5 hours x $10/hour x 1.2).
So, her total salary for the week is $400 + $12 = $512."

The new system had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month but was reduced by 30% in the third month. How many things were downloaded from the system in three months?

Answer: 210

Explanation:

In the first month, 60 downloads occurred, so in the second month, the number of downloads was 60 x 3 = 180. However, in the third month, 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads occurred, so the total number of downloads over three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210."

The trader wants to make a purchase choice between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% while the electronics market will increase by 1.5% in one month. If the trader is looking to increase profits by the end of the month by making a choice, how profitable will this be?

Answer:
The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5% in one month, which means that the value of the jewelry will be $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,025.
The electronics market is expected to increase by 1.5% in one month, which means that the value of the electronics will be $8,000 x 1.015 = $8,160.
If the trader chooses to buy the jewelry, they will make a profit of $5,025 - $5,000 = $25.
If the trader chooses to buy the electronics, they will make a profit of $8,160 - $8,000 = $160.
Therefore, the trader will make a profit of $25 if they choose to buy the jewelry, and $160 if they choose to buy the electronics."

I have 10 liters of orange juice two-thirds of the water and I want to add them to 15 liters of pineapple juice three-fifths of the water. But when I drink it, I've wasted 1 liter of orange juice. How much water is left in 24 liters?

Answer: 12 liters

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the amount of orange juice and pineapple juice needed to make 24 liters of mixed juice:

Orange juice: 2/3 x 10 = 6.67 liters
Pineapple juice: 3/5 x 15 = 9 liters

So, the total amount of juice needed is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water left after mixing the juices:

Water left: 24 - 15.67 = 8.33 liters

Therefore, there are 12 liters of water left after mixing the juices."

Marie ordered one chicken dish for $12.5 milk packs for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. Marie paid $50 in total. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box cost $8.50?

Answer: $8.50

Explanation:
Let's break down the cost of the items Marie ordered:

* Chicken dish: $12.50
* Milk packs: $3 x 4 = $12
* Apples: $1.50 x 4 = $6
* Pizza: $8.50 x ? = ?

Total cost = $12.50 + $12 + $6 + $8.50 = $50

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can divide the total cost by the cost of each box:

$50 / $8.50 = 6 boxes

Therefore, Marie ordered 6 boxes of pizza."

According to its nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams would you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?

Total answer: 400g

Explanation:
To determine how many grams of chips you would eat, you need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target after consuming 1800 calories. In this case, 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories are left in your target.

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips, you would eat 200 / 5 = 40 grams of chips.

So, the answer is 400g."
44	Charlie wants to sell honeycomb candles. With each pound of honeycomb candles, he can make 10 extinguished candles. One pound of elevators and cables costs $10.00 each. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?	20	"Answer only. 
Charlie wants to sell honeycomb candles. With each pound of honeycomb candles, he can make 10 extinguished candles. One pound of elevators and cables costs $10.00 each. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Answer: $14.00

Explanation:

To calculate Charlie's profit, we need to subtract the cost of making the candles from the revenue generated by selling them.

Cost of making 20 candles:

* 10 extinguished candles x $10.00 each = $100.00
* 10 pounds of elevators and cables x $10.00 each = $100.00

Total cost of making 20 candles = $200.00

Revenue from selling 20 candles:

* 20 candles x $2.00 each = $40.00

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00

Therefore, Charlie's profit is -$160.00 if he makes and sells 20 candles."

Uriah's bag of books is becoming too heavy for him. He has to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh a quarter of a pound each and his toys a half pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he have to remove?

Answer: 40 toys

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the total weight of Uriah's bag of books:

Total weight = 15 pounds

Now, let's find out how much each comic book weighs:

Weight of 1 comic book = 1/4 pound

So, the weight of 30 comic books is:

Weight of 30 comic books = 30 x 1/4 pound = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how much Uriah has to remove from his bag to bring the weight down to 15 pounds. Since the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, we need to remove:

Remaining weight = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that each toy weighs half a pound, so the weight of the toys in the bag is:

Weight of toys = 7.5 pounds / 0.5 pound = 15 toys

Therefore, Uriah has to remove 40 toys from his bag to bring the weight down to 15 pounds."

Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He usually gets a ticket for $7 and a snack for $7. If he has $40 a week, how many times can he go to the movies?

Answer: 6 times.

Explanation:

Peter has $40 to spend on movies. The cost of a ticket is $7, and the cost of a snack is also $7. To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we divide the amount of money he has by the cost of one trip:

$40 / $7 = 6 trips

So, Peter can go to the movies 6 times with the $40 he has."

A basket has 25 oranges of which 1 is bad, 20% is unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many are good oranges?

Answer: 10

Explanation:

* 1 orange is bad, so there are 24 good oranges.
* 20% of the oranges are unripe, so there are 24/5 = 4.8 unripe oranges (rounded up to 5).
* 2 oranges are sour, so there are 24 - 2 = 22 good oranges.

Therefore, there are 10 good oranges in the basket."

65	Jim spends two hours watching TV and then ends up going to bed and reading a long half hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?	36	"Answer only. 
Jim spends two hours watching TV and then ends up going to bed and reading a long half hour. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer: 16 hours

Explanation:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time he goes to bed, which is 3 times a week. Therefore, he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week.

Since he does this 4 weeks in a row, he spends 6 x 4 = 24 hours watching TV in total.

Similarly, he spends 30 minutes reading each night, which is also 3 times a week. Therefore, he spends 30 x 3 = 90 minutes reading per week.

Again, since he does this 4 weeks in a row, he spends 90 x 4 = 360 minutes reading in total.

So, Jim spends 24 hours watching TV and 360 minutes reading in 4 weeks."

A treasure hunter found a treasure chest filled with precious stones. There were 175 diamonds, 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond, and twice as many emeralds as rubles. How many precious stones were in the case?

Answer: 210

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* 175 diamonds
* 35 rubles/stones less than a diamond
* Twice as many emeralds as rubles

Now, let's use the information to find the total number of precious stones in the chest:

* Diamonds: 175
* Rubles: 35 (since 35 are less than a diamond)
* Emeralds: 2 \* 35 = 70

So, the total number of precious stones in the chest is 175 + 35 + 70 = 280.

Therefore, the answer is 280 precious stones in the treasure chest."

Judy teaches 5 dance classes daily, weekdays, and 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and you charge $15.00 per student, how much do you make in one week?

Answer: $4,500

Explanation:

Judy teaches 5 dance classes daily, which means she teaches 5 x 7 = 35 classes weekly.

Since Judy teaches weekdays and Saturdays, she teaches a total of 35 + 8 = 43 classes in a week.

If each class has 15 students and Judy charges $15.00 per student, then the total number of students she teaches in a week is 43 x 15 = 645 students.

Therefore, Judy makes $645 x $15.00 = $4,500 in one week."

Answer: $124

Explanation:

To find out how much Tommy raised, we need to multiply the number of brownies and cheesecakes sold by their respective prices.

Brownies: 43 slices x $3 per slice = $129
Cheesecakes: 23 slices x $4 per slice = $92
Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raised $221."
73	Sheila bought five phones for $150 each for 3 months' payment. 2% interest on each unit will be charged. How much will Sheila pay each month for 3 months?	255	"Answer only. 
Sheila bought five phones for $150 each for 3 months' payment. 2% interest on each unit will be charged. How much will Sheila pay each month for 3 months?

Answer: $180

Explanation:

To find out how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of each phone and then multiply it by the number of months she will be paying for it.

The total cost of each phone is:

$150 x 3 months = $450

So, Sheila will pay $450 x 2% interest = $9 per phone, per month.

Since Sheila bought 5 phones, she will pay $9 x 5 = $45 per month for all 5 phones."

Cecilia has recently bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, the puppy should be fed 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then the puppy should be fed 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Please help me solve this problem. I'm not sure how to approach it.

Answer: 
Cecilia will use 18 bags of dog food in the first year.

Explanation:

To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she will need and divide it by the number of cups in each bag.

The veterinarian recommends feeding the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days, which is equal to 180 cups. Then, the puppy should be fed 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is equal to 2 x 365 = 730 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use 18 bags of dog food in the first year:

180 cups / 110 cups per bag = 1.63 bags

Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 18 bags."

Explanation:
If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400 pounds of laundry / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 400 pounds of laundry / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry."

The football team has played 22 games. They have won 8 more than they have not won. How many have not won?

Answer: 14

Explanation:

Let's say the football team has won x games. Since they have won 8 more than they have not won, the number of games they have not won is x - 8.

We know that the total number of games they have played is 22, so the number of games they have not won is:

x - 8 = 22

Solving for x, we get:

x = 14

So, the football team has not won 14 games."

Jamali's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo. If Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamali's photo in the zoo?

Answer: 30

Explanation:
Let's assume Brittany's phone can hold x photos. Since Jamali's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, Jamali's phone can hold 6x photos.

The problem states that the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo. So, the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo is 50x/6x = 8 times less than the number of photos Brittany's phone can hold.

Since Jamali's phone holds 1800 photos, the number of birds in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo is 1800 / 8 = 225 birds. Therefore, there are 225 ducks in Jamali's photo of ducks in the zoo."

Uriah's backpack is too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic book weighs 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes his 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?

Answer: 30

Explanation:
To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we need to subtract the weight of his comic books from the total weight of his backpack.

Total weight of backpack = 15 pounds
Weight of comic books = 1/4 pound each x 30 comic books = 7.5 pounds

So, the remaining weight of the backpack = Total weight of backpack - Weight of comic books = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 30 toys from his backpack to make it lighter by 7.5 pounds."

129	The hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and the hospital $200 per hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from visits?	10000	"Answer only. 
The hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour for the hospital and the hospital $200 per hour for the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from visits?

Answer: $10,800

Explanation:
The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. This means that the hospital has 500 patients per day x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes of patient care per day.

The doctors charge $150 per hour for their services, and the hospital charges $200 per hour for the patients. So, the total cost of patient care per day is 12,000 minutes x $150 per hour = $180,000, and the total revenue from patient care per day is 12,000 minutes x $200 per hour = $240,000.

The profit from visits per day is calculated as follows:
Profit = Revenue - Cost = $240,000 - $180,000 = $60,000 per day.

To calculate the profit from visits over a year, we need to multiply the daily profit by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so the annual profit from visits is:
Profit from visits per year = Daily profit x Number of days in a year = $60,000 per day x 365 days = $21,900,000 per year.

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $21,900,000 per year from visits."

In a candy machine, there are 22 pinks, four times as many as in the sky. If there are 19 pinks, how many pink ones are there?

Answer: 78.

Explanation:

Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of pink candies in the machine:

* There are 4 times as many pinks in the machine as in the sky.
* In the sky, there are 19 pinks.
* So, in the machine, there are 4 × 19 = 76 pinks.

Since there are 22 pinks in the machine, and 76 pinks × 2 = 152, there are 78 pink candies in the machine."

Kim has started her own business as a housekeeper and calculates the profit she will make from her clients. She already has three clients, but she is talking to 5 other potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in her calculations. Each client's household will need 2 bottles of detergent and a pack of cleaning cloths. The detergent bottles will cost $2 each and the pack of cleaning cloths will cost $5 each. These are her costs. Calculate her total weekly salary to be $92. The profit is only the difference between the total salary and the total costs, so what is the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make per week?

Answer: $26.67

Explanation:
Kim's total weekly salary is calculated as follows:
Total salary = Number of clients x Cost per client
Total salary = 8 clients x $20 per client
Total salary = $160

Now, let's calculate the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make:
Profit per week = Total salary - Total costs
Profit per week = $160 - ($2 x 2 bottles per client + $5 x 1 pack per client)
Profit per week = $160 - $40 - $5 = $26.67

Therefore, the profit per week, per dollar, that Lucas will make is $26.67."

Answer: 1500

Explanation:

Johnny threw a box of 500 pieces of Lego on the floor. He also threw a box with three times as many pieces, which is 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Additionally, he threw a box with a quarter of the number of pieces, which is 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces. Therefore, Johnny picked up a total of 500 + 1500 + 125 = 1525 pieces of Lego."

Steve and Tim decide to see who will be the fastest to get from school to home. Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles away from school and pedals 440 times a minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school. If Tim can skate 264 times a minute, how long will the winner wait at his home before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: 50 minutes

Explanation:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how long it will take Steve to complete the race. Since Steve is allowed to ride his bike, we can assume that he will cover a distance of 3 miles in 1 minute.

So, the number of times Steve will pedal in 1 minute is:

440 times/minute = 440 revolutions/minute

Now, let's find out how long it will take Steve to complete the race. Since he lives 3 miles away from school, it will take him:

3 miles / 440 revolutions/minute = 6.8 minutes to complete the race

Now, let's find out how long the winner will wait at his home before the loser finishes the race. Since Tim lives 2 miles away from school and can skate 264 times a minute, it will take him:

2 miles / 264 times/minute = 7.5 minutes to complete the race

Since Steve completed the race in 6.8 minutes, the winner will wait at his home for:

7.5 minutes - 6.8 minutes = 0.75 minutes

Therefore, the winner will wait at his home for 0.75 minutes before the loser finishes the race."

Answer: 14

Explanation:

Dave ate 14 french fries before the sea otter ate the bag in his hand. The sea otter ate half of the remaining fries, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Then, the penguins ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries. The raccoon stole a quarter of the remaining fries, which is 14 / 4 = 3 fries. Finally, the ants carried off the last fries, leaving 0 fries. Therefore, the original package had 14 fries."

On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, college student Kimo has three classes a day. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two-hour classes a day. In one semester there are 16 school weeks. In the other semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?

Answer: 60 hours

Explanation:

In the first semester, Kimo has 3 classes/day x 3 days/week = 9 classes/week.
In the second semester, Kimo has 2 classes/day x 2 days/week = 4 classes/week.
Total number of classes in one semester = 9 + 4 = 13 classes.
Total hours spent attending classes in one semester = 13 classes x 2 hours/class = 26 hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends 60 hours attending classes in one semester."

Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 bagels every day. Each roll is four inches long, each croissant is six inches long, and each bagel is one foot long. If Bill puts all the baked treats from the beginning to the end, how long will it take him to prepare them?

Answer: 
The length of time it would take Bill to prepare the baked treats can be calculated as follows:

Rolls: 300 x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
Chocolate croissants: 120 x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
Bagels: 60 x 12 inches/bagel = 720 inches
Total length: 1940 inches

Therefore, it would take Bill approximately 1940 inches, or 16.5 feet, to prepare all the baked treats from the beginning to the end."

The water tank is 17 feet deep on Monday. On the second, the tank has an additional 17 feet of water. On the third, the water is two-thirds as deep as it was on the second. How deep is the water on the third.

Answer: 11 feet

Explanation:

On Monday, the water tank is 17 feet deep.
On Tuesday, the tank has an additional 17 feet of water, so it is now 34 feet deep (17 + 17 = 34).
On Wednesday, the water is two-thirds as deep as it was on Tuesday, so it is now 22 feet deep (34 / 2 = 22).
Therefore, the water is 11 feet deep on Wednesday (22 - 17 = 11)."

Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's unfinished order. Sandra has ordered Ne as many roses as white roses. She has also ordered pink roses, which were five times the number of white roses. Sandra has threatened her customers to drop off the roses at five o'clock. To save Sandra's business, how many roses does Fred have to send?

Answer: 20 roses.

Explanation:

Sandra has ordered Ne as many roses as white roses, which means she has ordered Ne - 1 white roses. Since pink roses are 5 times the number of white roses, Sandra has ordered 5(Ne - 1) = 5N - 5 roses.

Since Sandra has threatened to drop off the roses at 5 pm, Fred has to send N - 5 roses to save Sandra's business. Therefore, the answer is 20 roses."

Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, what is it like (expressed as a percentage) if you rotate a number greater than this

Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, what is it like (expressed as a percentage) if you rotate a number greater than this?

Answer:
If Jerry rotates the decimal axis 6, and he rotates a number greater than 6, then the number will appear to be a smaller percentage of its original value. This is because the decimal axis has been rotated 6 places to the right, which means that the number has been multiplied by 10^6, or 1,000,000. As a result, the number will appear to be a smaller percentage of its original value. For example, if Jerry originally had the number 100, and he rotated the decimal axis 6 places to the right, the number would appear to be 0.000001% of its original value."

187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed that it would have an interest rate of 2 percent. If Mandy had been able to pay after 3 months, how much should Benedict have given?	106	"Answer only. 
Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed that it would have an interest rate of 2 percent. If Mandy had been able to pay after 3 months, how much should Benedict have given?

Answer: $102

Explanation:

The amount owed by Mandy to Benedict is $100.
The interest rate is 2 percent, which means that for every $100 owed, $2 is added as interest.
If Mandy had been able to pay after 3 months, the amount owed would be:

$100 + ($2 x 3/12) = $102

Therefore, Benedict should have given $102 to Mandy."

John collects peaches for 3 hours.He can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute.How many peaches does he collect?

Answer: 6 peaches

Explanation:

If John collects peaches for 3 hours, he collects peaches for a total of 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Since he can collect 2 peaches in 1 minute, he collects a total of 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours."
191	A three-pound duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?	5	"Answer only. 
A three-pound duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?

Answer: 35 pounds

Explanation:

To determine how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we can use the information provided in the problem. If each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks in the flock, then the total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds x 10 ducks = 35 pounds per week.

Since there are seven days in a week, we can divide the total amount of insects needed per week by seven to find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day."
192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die. How many trees does he leave?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die. How many trees does he leave?

Tom plants 10 trees a year. He cuts down 2 trees a year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, an average of 30 percent of the trees die. How many trees does he leave?

Answer:
Tom leaves 20 trees after 10 years.

Explanation:

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees per year, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees after 1 year.

He cuts down 2 trees per year, so he has 60 - 2 = 58 trees after 2 years.

He has 58 - 30% of 58 = 39 trees after 3 years (since an average of 30% of the trees die each year).

He has 39 - 2 = 37 trees after 4 years.

He has 37 - 30% of 37 = 26 trees after 5 years.

He has 26 - 2 = 24 trees after 6 years.

He has 24 - 30% of 24 = 16 trees after 7 years.

He has 16 - 2 = 14 trees after 8 years.

He has 14 - 30% of 14 = 9 trees after 9 years.

He has 9 - 2 = 7 trees after 10 years.

Therefore, Tom leaves 7 trees after 10 years."

Sue lives in a funny neighborhood. One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue. On Friday morning they put 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned a quarter of the flamingos, painted them white, and put the newly painted Flamingos back in Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they would add more pink plastic flamingos to the collection of 18.
What is the probability that Sue will notice the flamingos in her front yard on Sunday morning?

Answer: 1/3

Explanation:

The probability of Sue noticing the flamingos in her front yard on Sunday morning is 2/3.

On Friday morning, the neighbors put 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. Since Sue lives in a funny neighborhood, it's possible that she might not notice the flamingos right away or might not think much of them.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors returned a quarter of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back in Sue's front yard. This means that the number of flamingos in Sue's front yard increased from 18 to 21 (18 original + 3 returned + 1 newly painted). However, since Sue is still in the same state of mind as on Friday (i.e., she might not have noticed the flamingos yet or might not think much of them), the probability of her noticing the flamingos on Sunday morning is still 2/3.

Therefore, the probability that Sue will notice the flamingos in her front yard on Sunday morning is 1/3."

Pounds of carrots are distributed to 40 restaurants in one city. How many pounds of carrots are not used?

Answer: 10 pounds

Explanation:
Let's assume the total weight of carrots distributed to 40 restaurants is 400 pounds.

If 10 pounds of carrots are not used, then the remaining amount used by the restaurants is:

400 pounds - 10 pounds = 390 pounds

Therefore, 10 pounds of carrots are not used."

At the end of the month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected at least 20 more cards than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined. How many cards does she now have in total?

Answer: 180

Explanation:

In the first month, she collected 3x = 3 x 30 = 90 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 more cards, so she now has 90 + 20 = 110 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined, which is 110 x 2 = 220 cards.

Therefore, she now has a total of 90 + 110 + 220 = 180 cards."

Josie grows grapes on 10 acre farms. One Acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and produces 2 barrels of pressed grapes. How many barrels of pressed grapes does he produce per year on his farm?

Answer: 50 barrels.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Josie grows grapes on 10 acre farms.
* One acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
* 2 barrels of pressed grapes are produced from 1 ton of grapes.

Now, let's apply these values to find the total number of barrels of pressed grapes produced by Josie's farm per year:

10 acres x 5 tons/acre/year = 50 tons of grapes per year
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of pressed grapes per year

Therefore, Josie produces 100 barrels of pressed grapes per year on his farm."

211	Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?	4	"Answer only. 
Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If you have two chickens instead of red chickens, how many red chickens do you have?

Answer: 2

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of red chickens is x.

From the problem statement, we know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x.

We also know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs collected is 42 + 3x.

Since the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs per day.

Now, we can set up the equation:

42 + 3x = 10 + 5(2)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2

So, Jerry has 2 red chickens."

$64 / $8 = 8 hours

Therefore, Lori will have to work 8 hours before she can buy the shoes and belt."

Kalinda works on a 360-piece puzzle with her mother. Kalinda can usually put 4 pieces in one minute. Her mother can put half as many pieces in one minute as Kalinda. How many minutes would it take them to finish the puzzle?

Answer: 72 minutes.

Explanation:
Kalinda can put 4 pieces in one minute, so she can do 4 x 360 = 1440 pieces in one hour.
Her mother can do half as many pieces in one minute as Kalinda, so her rate is 1440 / 2 = 720 pieces in one hour.
Therefore, it will take them 72 minutes to finish the puzzle, since they have to complete 360 - 72 = 288 pieces."

Steve decides to start eating tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week how many vineyards does he need?

Steve decides to start eating tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 a day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes a week, how many vineyards does he need?

Answer: 2 vineyards.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, which means he eats 42 tomatoes per week (6 x 7).

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs 14 vineyards to produce all the tomatoes he needs (42 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per week = 14 vineyards)."

There are 4 alligators in one aquarium and 32 in the other aquarium. The difference between the number of alligators is twice that of the fish in both aquariums. If the aquariums have the same number of alligators in them, how many alligators are in each aquarium?

Answer: 8

Explanation:
Let's say the number of alligators in the first aquarium is x. Then, the number of alligators in the second aquarium is 32 - x.

We know that the difference between the number of alligators in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write:

2(x - 4) = 32

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 8 = 32

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, there are 8 alligators in each aquarium."

Jean's repairman costs $250 an hour. He needs the most expensive mics for the movie he's in and it takes six hours to make a day and he needs to make a week. The movie takes five weeks to finish. After the movie is finished the repairman gives Jean a 10 percent discount for the average amount of work done. How much did Jean pay?

Answer: $3,750

Explanation:

* The repairman costs $250 an hour, so for 6 hours of work, Jean pays $1,500.
* For a week of work, Jean pays $1,500 x 7 = $10,500.
* For the entire 5-week movie shoot, Jean pays $10,500 x 5 = $52,500.
* After the movie is finished, the repairman gives Jean a 10% discount on the average amount of work done. The average amount of work done is $52,500 / 5 weeks = $10,500. Jean pays $10,500 x 10% = $1,050.
* Therefore, Jean pays a total of $52,500 + $1,050 = $3,750."
