Every day Wendi feeds three cups of raw chicken feed, containing seeds, protein and vegetables for good health. She feeds the chickens three times. In the morning she feeds a flock of chickens 15 cups. In the afternoon she feeds her chickens 25 cups. How many cups of food does it take to feed her chickens at the end of the day if Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Please answer in the format of:
Cups of food per chicken = x

Answer:
Cups of food per chicken = 3

Explanation:
Wendi feeds 3 times a day, and she feeds 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. To find out how many cups of food it takes to feed her chickens at the end of the day, we need to divide the total amount of food she feeds by the number of chickens she has. In this case, Wendi has 20 chickens, so we divide 15 + 25 by 20:
Cups of food per chicken = 3

Therefore, it takes 3 cups of food to feed each of Wendi's 20 chickens at the end of the day."

9	Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She was also paid 1.2 times her hourly wage if she worked as a waitress. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of her work week was $10. She was also paid 1.2 times her hourly wage if she worked as a waitress. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, how much did she earn this week?

Answer: $570.

Explanation:

First, calculate Eliza's hourly wage for the first 40 hours of her work week:

$10/hour x 40 hours = $400

Next, calculate her hourly wage for the additional 5 hours she worked:

$10/hour x 5 hours = $50

Now, calculate her total earnings for the week:

$400 + $50 = $450

Finally, multiply her total earnings by 1.2 to find her weekly earnings:

$450 x 1.2 = $570

Therefore, Eliza earned $570 this week."

A new program received 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month, but then it dropped by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did this program get in total in three months?

Answer: 210

Explanation:

In the first month, the program received 60 downloads.
In the second month, the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, so it received 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.
In the third month, the number of downloads dropped by 30%, so it received 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads.

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the program in three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 210."

Carlos planted a lemon tree. It would cost $90 for a lemon. Each year he would produce 7 lemons, each of which he could sell for $1.5. Water and fertilizer for the tree cost $3 a year. How long would it take for him to start making money from the lemon tree?

Answer: 5 years.

Explanation:

Carlos would make $11 (7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon) per year from selling the lemons. His total revenue would be $11 per year.

His costs would be $3 per year for water and fertilizer.

So, he would be making a profit of $8 per year ($11 - $3).

It would take 5 years for Carlos to make $40 ($8 per year x 5 years) in profits. Therefore, it would take 5 years for him to start making money from the lemon tree."

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what would her annual salary be?	57500	"Answer only. 
If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what would her annual salary be?

Answer: $40,000

Explanation:
To calculate the annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked in a year.

For the teacher, she worked 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
For the coach, she worked 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

So, the total number of hours worked per year is 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours/year

If she is paid $40/hour, her annual salary would be:
$40/hour x 2500 hours/year = $100,000/year"
18	Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast. How many dozen can she eat in 4 weeks?	7	"Answer only. 
Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast. How many dozen can she eat in 4 weeks?

Answer: 12 dozen

Explanation:
Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning, so she eats 3 x 21 = 63 omelets in one week.
To find out how many dozen she can eat in 4 weeks, divide the total number of omelets by 12: 63 / 12 = 5.25 dozen. Since you can't eat a fraction of a dozen, round up to the nearest whole number: 5.25 → 6 dozen. Therefore, Claire can eat 6 dozen egg omelets in 4 weeks."
19	It takes Marissa an hour to walk the first four miles [12 km], then an hour to walk the next two. If she wants her average speed to be four miles per hour, how much more speed would she need to travel the rest of the way?	6	"Answer only. 
It takes Marissa an hour to walk the first four miles [12 km], then an hour to walk the next two. If she wants her average speed to be four miles per hour, how much more speed would she need to travel the rest of the way?

Answer: 1.5 hours

Explanation:

Marissa's total distance to walk is 20 miles (32 km).

She has already walked the first 4 miles (12 km) in 1 hour, so her average speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles/hour.

For the next 2 miles (3.2 km), she walks for 1 hour, so her average speed for the last 2 miles is also 4 miles/hour.

To find out how much more speed Marissa needs to travel the rest of the way, we subtract the average speed for the last 2 miles from the total distance to walk:

Rest of the distance = Total distance - (Last 2 miles / Last 2 miles' average speed)
= 20 miles - (3.2 km / 4 miles/hour)
= 16.8 miles / 4 miles/hour
= 4.2 hours

Therefore, Marissa needs an additional 1.5 hours (4.2 hours - 1 hour) to complete her journey at an average speed of 4 miles/hour."
20	I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. But when I pour out one liter of orange juice, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds of the water, and I want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-fifths of the water. But when I pour out one liter of orange juice, how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

Answer: 15 liters

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the total volume of juice we have:

10 liters of orange juice + 15 liters of pineapple juice = 25 liters of juice

Now, let's find out how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters:

24 liters - 1 liter (of orange juice poured out) = 23 liters of water

Therefore, there are 15 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters of juice."

Cynthia drinks ice cream every night. She buys boxes of ice cream with 15 kinds of ice cream in each box for $4.00 per box. After 60 days how much will she spend on ice cream?

Answer: $240.00

Explanation:
Cynthia buys boxes of ice cream with 15 kinds of ice cream in each box for $4.00 per box.
If she drinks ice cream every night, she will consume one box of ice cream per night.
After 60 days, she will have consumed 60 boxes of ice cream, which is equal to $60 x 60 = $3600.00.
Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days is $3600.00."

44	Charlie wants to sell wax candles. From each pile of wax, he can make 10 candles. A whole pile of wax and candles cost $10.00 in inventory. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what would be his profit if he sold 20 candles?	20	"Answer only. 
Charlie wants to sell wax candles. From each pile of wax, he can make 10 candles. A whole pile of wax and candles cost $10.00 in inventory. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what would be his profit if he sold 20 candles?

Answer: $160.00

Explanation:

Charlie has 5 piles of wax, each containing enough wax to make 10 candles. If he sells each candle for $2.00, he will make $20.00 from each pile of wax (10 candles x $2.00 per candle = $20.00). Since he has 5 piles of wax, he will make a total of $100.00 from selling candles (5 piles x $20.00 per pile = $100.00).

To find Charlie's profit, we subtract the cost of the inventory from the revenue he generated. In this case, the cost of the inventory is $10.00 per pile, so the profit is $90.00 ($100.00 - $10.00). Since Charlie sold 20 candles, his profit per candle is $4.50 ($90.00 / 20 candles = $4.50 per candle)."

50	Lloyd owned a chicken farm. His chicken farm produced 252 eggs a day and he sold them for $2 a dozen. How much did Lloyd make on eggs per week?	294	"Answer only. 
Lloyd owned a chicken farm. His chicken farm produced 252 eggs a day and he sold them for $2 a dozen. How much did Lloyd make on eggs per week?

Answer: $504.

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from eggs, we need to multiply the number of eggs produced per day by the number of days in a week.

252 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sold each egg for $2, his weekly earnings from eggs would be:

1,764 eggs/week x $2/egg = $3,528/week

Therefore, Lloyd made $3,528 per week from his chicken farm."

Uriah's book bag was heavy. He had to remove 15 pounds of it. His comic books weighed a quarter of a pound each and his toys weighed a half pound each. If he collected 30 comic books, how many children's toys did he need to remove?

Answer: 30

Explanation:
Uriah's book bag was heavy, so he had to remove some of the contents. Let's say the total weight of the contents in the book bag is W pounds.

We know that the comic books weigh a quarter of a pound each, so the weight of 30 comic books is 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

We also know that the toys weigh a half pound each, so the weight of 30 toys is 30 x 0.5 = 15 pounds.

So, the total weight of the contents in the book bag after removing the comic books is W - 7.5 = 12.5 pounds.

Since the book bag was originally heavy, we know that W > 12.5 pounds. Therefore, the number of children's toys that Uriah needed to remove to make the book bag light enough to carry is:

Number of toys = W - 12.5
= 12.5
= 30

Therefore, Uriah needed to remove 30 children's toys from his book bag to make it light enough to carry."

A mechanic charges different fees for repairing truck tires and trailers. For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic charges $60 and for each small car tire repaired, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 trailers. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailers tires and did not repair any truck tires. How much extra income did the mechanic earn that day to get the extra work done?

Answer: $640.

To find out how much extra income the mechanic earned on Friday, we need to subtract the amount the mechanic charged for repairing truck tires on Thursday from the amount the mechanic charged for repairing trailer tires on Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and charged $60 per tire, so the total amount earned from repairing truck tires on Thursday was $60 x 6 = $360.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 trailer tires and charged $40 per tire, so the total amount earned from repairing trailer tires on Friday was $40 x 12 = $480.

Therefore, the mechanic earned an extra $480 on Friday compared to Thursday."

Peter is planning to go to the theater this week. He always gets tickets for $7 and tickets for $7. If he has $42 a week, how often can he go to the theater?

Answer: 6 times

Explanation:

Let's assume Peter has $42 to spend on theater tickets. Since he always buys tickets for $7, he can buy 6 tickets with his budget of $42.

6 tickets = $42

Therefore, Peter can go to the theater 6 times with the $42 he has."

The average weight of the driver and the truck if there is no one inside is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge?	83	"Answer only. 
A wooden bridge can hold no more than 5000 pounds. A truck loaded with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The average weight of the driver and the truck if there is no one inside is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge?

Answer: 33 boxes.

Explanation:

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck without exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight of the bridge.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Weight of the truck and driver = 3755 pounds

Total weight = 5000 + 3755 = 8755 pounds

Now, we can divide the total weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight / Weight of each box
= 8755 pounds / 15 pounds per box
= 588 boxes

However, we cannot load more than 33 boxes onto a truck because the truck itself weighs 3755 pounds, which is greater than the maximum weight of the bridge. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck while not exceeding the maximum capacity of the bridge is 33 boxes."

60	A basket contains 25 oranges, 1 of which is bad, 20 percent is green, 2 are juicy, and the rest are good.	17	"Answer only. 
A basket contains 25 oranges, 1 of which is bad, 20 percent is green, 2 are juicy, and the rest are good.
What is the probability that an orange picked at random from the basket is good?

Probability = (Number of good oranges / Total number of oranges) x 100

So, the answer is:

Probability = (25 - 1) / 25 x 100 = 92%

Explanation:

In this problem, we are given that the basket contains 25 oranges, and 1 of them is bad. This means that there are 24 good oranges in the basket.

We are also told that 20% of the oranges are green. This means that 5 oranges (20% of 25) are green.

Additionally, we are told that 2 oranges are juicy. This means that there are 23 oranges that are not juicy.

So, the total number of oranges in the basket is 25, and the number of good oranges is 24. The probability of picking a good orange at random from the basket is:

Probability = (24 / 25) x 100 = 92%

Therefore, the answer is 92%."

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to lie down and read for half of the time he spends watching. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Answer: 16 hours

Explanation:
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to read for half of the time. So, he spends 2/2 = 1 hour reading.
He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 1 hour reading per week.
In 4 weeks, he spends 1 hour/week x 4 weeks = 4 hours reading.
Add the 4 hours of reading to the 2 hours of watching TV, Jim spends 6 hours per week on these activities.
In 4 weeks, he spends 6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours watching TV and reading."

Vincent can buy flowers in a 3-pack for $2.50 or in a 2-pack for $1. How much discount would he get by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price?

Answer: $14.40

Explanation:

To find the discount, we need to find the difference between the price of 3 packs and the price of 2 packs.

Price of 3 packs = $2.50 x 3 = $7.50
Price of 2 packs = $1 x 2 = $2

Discount = $7.50 - $2 = $5.50

So, Vincent would get a discount of $5.50 by buying 18 flowers at a reasonable price."

One company pays each employee $600 a month. The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of the starting salary annually for those who have stayed with the company for five years. If Sylvie completed 5 years with the company last December, what is her annual salary after three additional years of service?

Salary = $600 x (1 + 0.10) x (1 + 0.10) x (1 + 0.10)
Salary = $600 x 1.10 x 1.20 x 1.30 = $780

Christina is planning a birthday party and needs .75 free bags for the invited guest, because 1/4 of the attendees are not coming out. She invited 16 friends. Free bags $2 each. How much will it cost?

Answer: $1.75

Explanation:

To calculate the cost of free bags for the invited guests, we need to first calculate the number of guests who are coming to the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees are not coming out, the number of guests coming to the party is 3/4 of 16, which is 12 guests.

So, the number of free bags needed is 12 x 2 = 24 free bags.

Therefore, the cost of free bags will be $2 x 24 = $1.75."

103	If the city is 26 miles [42 km] from the coast, how many minutes would it take for the fog to cover the entire city?	140	"Answer only. 
If the city is 26 miles [42 km] from the coast, how many minutes would it take for the fog to cover the entire city?

Answer: 10 minutes

Explanation:

To calculate the time it would take for the fog to cover the entire city, we need to know the speed of the fog. Since the fog is 26 miles (42 km) from the coast, we can assume that it is moving at a constant speed of 26 miles (42 km) per hour.

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so we can calculate the time it would take for the fog to cover the entire city as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 26 miles / 26 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it would take the fog 1 hour (or 60 minutes) to cover the entire city."

Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today he took another test with 100 questions similar to his time yesterday. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he have left to complete?

Answer: 30 questions

Explanation:
Mark completed the first test in 8 hours, so he completed 8/5 = 1.6 questions per hour.
He completed the second test in 6 hours, so he completed 6/5 = 1.2 questions per hour.
Since he had 75 questions on the first test and 100 questions on the second test, he had 75 - 1.6 = 73.4 questions left to complete on the second test, and he had 100 - 1.2 = 98.8 questions left to complete on the second test.
Therefore, Mark had 30 questions left to complete on the second test."

142	Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day and has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?	140	"Answer only. 
Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day and has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money could Jordan make in a week if he spent his time playing video games instead of working?

Answer: $35

Explanation:

If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, that means he plays for a total of 14 hours a week (2 hours/day x 7 days/week).

If he makes $10/hour at his part-time job, then he makes a total of $140/week (14 hours/week x $10/hour).

So, if Jordan spent his time playing video games instead of working, he could make $35/week ( $140/week - $100/week)."

Answer: 1500.

Explanation:

Johnny threw a box of 500 legos on the floor, which means he picked up 500 legos.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the college student Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he had two hours of lessons a day. In one semester, there were 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours did Kimo spend attending classes?

Answer: 240 hours.

Explanation:

* On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo had 1 hour classes three times a day, so he spent 3 hours per day in class.
* On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo had 2 hours of lessons a day, so he spent 4 hours per day in class.
* In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so Kimo spent a total of:
	+ 3 hours/day x 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
	+ 4 hours/day x 2 days/week = 8 hours/week
	Total hours per semester = 9 hours/week x 16 weeks = 144 hours/semester

Therefore, Kimo spent a total of 240 hours (144 hours/semester x 2 semesters) attending classes in one semester."

The parade organizers ordered new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a cap that costs US$25, a jacket that costs three times as much as a suit, and trousers that cost an average of a suit and jacket. How much is the total cost of each uniform?

Answer: $150

Explanation:

Let's break down the cost of each component of the uniform:

* Cap: $25
* Jacket: $3x$25 = $75
* Trousers: $x + $25 = $150

Since the total cost of each uniform is $150, we can set up the equation:

$25 + $75 + $x = $150

Solving for x, we get:

x = $75

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon and sugar for $2 a gallon; they sell a glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses for a gallon; if they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemon?

Answer: $15

Explanation:

Juan and Carlos sell a glass of lemon juice for $0.50, so they make $0.50 x 20 glasses = $10 from lemon juice.
Since they sell lemon juice for $3 a gallon, they make $3 x 20 glasses = $60 from lemon juice.
Since they sell sugar for $2 a gallon, they make $2 x 20 gallons = $40 from sugar.
So their total profit is $60 + $40 = $100.
Therefore, they spent $100 / $25 = $15 on lemon juice."

A merchant buys sacks of wheat from a farmer for $20 each. If each sack of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each, how many sacks did he sell?

Answer: 13 sacks

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The merchant buys sacks of wheat from the farmer for $20 each.
* It costs $2 to transport each sack of wheat from the farm to the warehouse.
* The merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks for $30 each.

Now, let's use the information to find the number of sacks the merchant sold:

Profit = Price per sack x Number of sacks sold
= $30 x Number of sacks sold

We know that the merchant made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation:

$30 x Number of sacks sold = $400

Now, we can solve for the number of sacks sold:

Number of sacks sold = $400 / $30
= 13 sacks

Therefore, the merchant sold 13 sacks of wheat."

Answer: $12.07

Explanation:

Total amount spent = $20.25 + $4.50 + $33 + $33 = $99.75

Number of friends = 3

Each friend's share = $99.75 / 3 = $33.25

191	Pigeons need to eat an average of 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there is a flock of ten pigeons, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?	5	"Answer only. 
Pigeons need to eat an average of 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there is a flock of ten pigeons, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?

Answer: 35 pounds

Explanation:
To determine how many pounds of insects the pigeons need per day, we can use the information provided in the problem that they need to eat an average of 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the weekly amount by 7 to find the daily amount:

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, the pigeons in the flock of ten need to eat 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."

There are 4 flowers in the flower pot. There are 7 more dahlias than there are flowers in the flower pot. How many flowers are there in the whole flower pot?

Answer: 35

Explanation:

Let's assume the number of flowers in the flower pot is x.

We know that there are 4 flowers in the flower pot.

So, the number of dahlias is 7 more than the number of flowers in the flower pot.

Dahlias = 7 + x

We are also given that there are 4 flowers in the flower pot.

So, the number of dahlias is 7 + 4 = 11.

Therefore, the number of flowers in the flower pot is x - 4 = 35."

242	Mike had five pen pals, but he ended the correspondence with two of them. Each of them sent two five-page e-mails a week. He responded respectfully. He could write one page every six minutes. How many hours did he spend writing a week?	3	"Answer only. 
Mike had five pen pals, but he ended the correspondence with two of them. Each of them sent two five-page e-mails a week. He responded respectfully. He could write one page every six minutes. How many hours did he spend writing a week?

Answer: 10 hours.

To calculate the hours Mike spent writing a week, we need to multiply the number of e-mails he received from each pen pal by the number of pages in each e-mail. Since each pen pal sent two five-page e-mails per week, Mike received a total of 10 pages from each pen pal per week (2 x 5 pages = 10 pages).

Since Mike could write one page every six minutes, he spent 6 minutes writing each page. Therefore, he spent 60 minutes writing per week (10 pages x 6 minutes per page = 60 minutes).

Finally, to convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60. Therefore, Mike spent 10 hours writing per week (60 minutes / 60 = 10 hours)."

Ginger gives Griffin one handful of her french fries, then Colby takes 3 less than Griffin's 3 and the same number of french fries that Kyle took. If in the end Griffin has 27, how many fries does Ginger give Griffin?

Answer: 4

Explanation:

* Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 24.
* Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy takes 10 fries from Griffin.
* Ginger gives Griffin one handful of fries, which is 4 fries.
* Colby takes 3 less than Griffin's remaining fries, which is 2 fries.
* In the end, Griffin has 27 fries, so Ginger gave Griffin 4 fries."
245	There are 4 sea turtles in one aquarium and 32 sea turtles in another. The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums. If all the turtles have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are in each aquarium?	7	"Answer only. 
There are 4 sea turtles in one aquarium and 32 sea turtles in another. The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums. If all the turtles have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are in each aquarium?

Answer: 128

Explanation:
Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium x.

In the first aquarium, there are 4 sea turtles, so the total number of turtles is 4x.
In the second aquarium, there are 32 sea turtles, so the total number of turtles is 32x.

The difference between the number of sea turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in all the aquariums, so we can write:
4x - 32x = 2(x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 64

So, there are 32 fish in each aquarium."

The film takes 5 weeks to complete. After the film is finished the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much does Jean pay?

Answer: $250 x 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = $15,000
