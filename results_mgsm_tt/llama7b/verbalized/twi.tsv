12	Carlos is planting a tree. The cost of planting a tree is $90 per year, while planting 7 trees can cost $1.5 each. He spends $3 per year watering the tree. How many years will it take to get the money?	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos is planting a tree. The cost of planting a tree is $90 per year, while planting 7 trees can cost $1.5 each. He spends $3 per year watering the tree. How many years will it take to get the money?

Answer: 

$90/year

Explanation:

Carlos spends $90 per year to plant a single tree. If he plants 7 trees, he will spend $700 ($90 x 7) in the first year.

If he plants 7 trees, the cost of planting each tree is $1.5, so the total cost of planting 7 trees is $10.5 ($1.5 x 7).

In the first year, Carlos spends $700 to plant the 7 trees and $3 to water each tree, for a total of $703.

To calculate how many years it will take to get the money, we can divide the total cost by the annual cost of planting a tree:

$703 / $90 = 7.8 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 7.8 years to get the money he spends on planting the tree."	7

A seller offers to buy two items: jewelry for $5,000 and electrical equipment for $8,000. His financial advisor expects the jewelry market to grow 2.5% and the electrical equipment market to grow 1.2% in the same month. If the seller offers to make a profit at the end of the month, what is the profit?

Answer: $3,250

Explanation:

The seller offers to buy the jewelry for $5,000 and the electrical equipment for $8,000. If the jewelry market grows 2.5% and the electrical equipment market grows 1.2% in the same month, the value of the jewelry and electrical equipment will increase by $125 and $96, respectively.

The seller can then sell the jewelry for $5,125 and the electrical equipment for $8,896, resulting in a profit of $3,250 ($8,896 - $5,125)."	5125

17	Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 an hour to train athletes. If she works fifty weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her salary for the entire year?	57500	"Answer only. 
Jill is paid $20 an hour to teach and $30 an hour to train athletes. If she works fifty weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what is her salary for the entire year?

Answer: $57,000

Explanation:

To calculate Jill's salary for the entire year, we need to multiply her weekly hours by the number of weeks she works in a year. As a teacher, Jill works 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $1,750/week. As a coach, Jill works 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $750/week.

Then, we add up Jill's salary from both teaching and coaching to get her total salary for the year: $1,750/week x 50 weeks = $87,500/year from teaching, and $750/week x 50 weeks = $37,500/year from coaching. Therefore, Jill's total salary for the year is $87,500 + $37,500 = $57,500."	57500

23	A candle has a rate of 2 meters-per-hour of illumination. What is the average length of each candle if it is illuminated from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm?	8	"Answer only. 
A candle has a rate of 2 meters-per-hour of illumination. What is the average length of each candle if it is illuminated from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm?

Answer: 4 meters

Explanation:

The rate of illumination of a candle is 2 meters-per-hour, which means that the candle will illuminate a distance of 2 meters in 1 hour.

If the candle is illuminated from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, the time period is 4 hours.

So, the average length of each candle illuminated during this time period is:

2 meters/hour x 4 hours = 8 meters

Therefore, the average length of each candle is 8 meters."	8

Marie ordered one chicken for $12, 5 boxes of milk for $3 each, five boxes for $1.50 each, and several boxes of pizza. All together Marie paid $50. What boxes of pizza did Marie buy for $8.50 each?

Answer: 6 boxes

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the cost of each item that Marie bought:

* 1 chicken = $12
* 5 boxes of milk = $3 x 5 = $15
* 5 boxes of milk = $1.50 x 5 = $7.50
* Several boxes of pizza = $8.50 x x = $8.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of everything Marie bought:

$12 + $15 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $50

Since Marie paid a total of $50, and she bought 5 boxes of pizza for $8.50 each, she must have bought 5 x $8.50 = $42.50 worth of pizza.

Therefore, Marie bought 6 boxes of pizza for $8.50 each."	8

43	In nutrition terms, each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If 300g of chips has 5 calories per serving, how many grams can you eat per day if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per serving?	48	"Answer only. 
In nutrition terms, each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If 300g of chips has 5 calories per serving, how many grams can you eat per day if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per serving?

Answer: 300g 

Explanation: To determine how many grams of chips you can eat per day, you need to divide the total calories you want to consume by the number of calories in each serving of chips. In this case, if your food energy goal is 2000 calories per day and each bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, you can eat 2000 / 250 = 8 bags of chips per day. Since each bag is 300g, you can eat 8 x 300g = 2400g of chips per day."	2400
44	Christie wants to sell a pair of pencils. For each pound of pencils, she can make 10 films. Each pound of pencils and the book is $10.00. If she sells each pencil for $2.00, how much profit will she make if she sells 20 pencils?	20	"Answer only. 
Christie wants to sell a pair of pencils. For each pound of pencils, she can make 10 films. Each pound of pencils and the book is $10.00. If she sells each pencil for $2.00, how much profit will she make if she sells 20 pencils?

Answer: $40.00

Explanation:
To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from the revenue.

Cost of 20 pencils = 20 x $2.00 = $40.00

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $40.00 = $0.00

Therefore, Christie will not make any profit if she sells 20 pencils."	20

47	John bought two red rings for twice the price of two rings. The price of the red rings was two percent less than the price of the two rings, which was $40 each. How much money did he spend on the ring?	800	"Answer only. 
John bought two red rings for twice the price of two rings. The price of the red rings was two percent less than the price of the two rings, which was $40 each. How much money did he spend on the ring?

Answer: $32.

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The price of two red rings is $20 each.
* The price of two rings is $40 each.
* The price of the red rings is two percent less than the price of the two rings.

Now, let's use the information to find out how much money John spent on the rings:

The price of two red rings = $20 x 2 = $40
The price of two rings = $40 x 2 = $80

Since the price of the red rings is two percent less than the price of the two rings, we can deduce that:

$40 (price of red rings) = $80 - 2%

Solving for $40, we get:

$40 = $80 - 2%
$40 = $80 / 100
$40 = $0.80

So, John spent $0.80 on each red ring, which means he spent a total of $1.60 on the two red rings.

Therefore, the answer is $1.60."	1

Uriah's sack contained ten birds. He must have taken 15 pounds from it. Each of his sacks weighed 1⁄4 pound and each of his sacks was 1⁄2 pound. If he took 30 sacks, would he have taken any more sacks?

Answer: No, he would not have taken any more sacks.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Uriah's sack contained ten birds.
* He must have taken 15 pounds from it.
* Each of his sacks weighed 1/4 pound.
* Each of his sacks was 1/2 pound.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the sacks Uriah took:

Total weight of sacks = Number of sacks x Weight of each sack
= 30 sacks x 1/4 pound
= 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah took 15 pounds from his sack, he must have taken 7.5 pounds of sacks. Therefore, he did not take any more sacks."	7

A wooden bridge can carry more than 5000 pounds of cargo. The most important thing to do is to ask the locals to wrap boxes of equal weight of 15 pounds each on the bridge. If you add the box and the empty box, the total weight is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding the capacity of the bridge?

Answer: 250 boxes.

Explanation:
To find out the number of boxes that can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding its capacity, we need to divide the bridge's capacity by the weight of a single box. The capacity of the bridge is 5000 pounds, and the weight of a single box is 15 pounds, so we can divide 5000 by 15 to get the number of boxes that can be loaded:

5000 ÷ 15 = 333 boxes

Therefore, 250 boxes can be loaded on the bridge without exceeding its capacity."	250

There's a piece of paper that weighs 25 pounds that's one-tenth as much, one-twentieth as much, two-tenths as much, and the rest is fine. How much is fine?

Answer: 25 pounds.

Explanation:

The piece of paper weighs 25 pounds, so one-tenth of that is 2.5 pounds (25 x 0.1 = 2.5).
One-twentieth of that is 2.5 pounds (25 x 0.2 = 5).
Two-tenths of that is 5 pounds (25 x 0.2 = 5).
So, the rest is 25 - 2.5 - 5 = 17 pounds."	17

Yesterday, he was listed among the producers of a film for which he was paid $140 a month. If the film company took a 10% interest in the first half of the year and he took a 10% interest in the second half of the year, find out how much he paid the film company for the entire year.

(a) $1400
(b) $14000
(c) $140000
(d) $1400000

Answer: (b) $14000.

Explanation:

Let's break down the calculation:

1. In the first half of the year, the film company took a 10% interest in the film, which means they received 10% of the total production budget of $1400. So, the film company received $140 (10% of $1400).
2. In the second half of the year, the producer took a 10% interest in the film, which means they received 10% of the total production budget of $1400. So, the producer received $140 (10% of $1400).
3. Therefore, the total amount paid to the film company and the producer for the entire year is:

$1400 (first half) + $140 (second half) = $14000.

So, the answer is (b) $14000."	14000

65	Jim watches TV for 2 hours before he plans to go to bed and reads books for two and a half hours. That's three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in a week?	36	"Answer only. 
Jim watches TV for 2 hours before he plans to go to bed and reads books for two and a half hours. That's three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in a week?

Answer: 6 hours.

Explanation:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours before bed, which means he watches TV for 2 hours x 3 times a week = 6 hours per week.
Similarly, he reads books for 2.5 hours x 3 times a week = 7.5 hours per week.
Therefore, Jim spends a total of 6 + 7.5 = 13.5 hours per week watching TV and reading."	13

The treasure-seeker finds a treasure chest full of precious stones. It is 175 cubits long, and the precious stones are less than 35 cubits and twice as many as the diamonds. What are the precious stones in the chest?

Answer: Diamonds.

Explanation:

Let the number of diamonds be x.

Since the precious stones are twice as many as the diamonds, the number of precious stones is 2x.

The total length of the treasure chest is 175 cubits.

The length of the chest is equal to the sum of the lengths of all the stones inside it, so we can write:

175 = x + 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 175

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 58

So, there are 58 diamonds in the chest."	58
68	There are twice as many men as women at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 men and 50 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?	36	"Answer only. 
There are twice as many men as women at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 men and 50 students for every teacher, how many teachers are there?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students at Dr. Wertz's school is x.

Since there are twice as many men as women, the number of men is 2x.

The number of women is x/2.

According to the problem, there are 60 men and 50 students for every teacher, so the number of teachers is 60x/50.

Now, we can use the equation we set up to solve for x, the total number of students at Dr. Wertz's school:

2x = 60
x = 30

So, there are 30 students at Dr. Wertz's school.

Since there are 50 students for every teacher, there are 50/2 = 25 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

Therefore, the answer is 12."	12

Judy teaches 5 classes a day, Monday through Friday, and has taught 8 classes on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students and she earns $15 per student, how much money does she make in a week?

Answer: $12,900

Explanation:
Judy teaches 5 classes a day, Monday through Friday, for a total of 25 classes per week (5 x 5 = 25).

If Judy earns $15 per student, then her total weekly earnings are 375 x $15 = $5,625.
Therefore, Judy makes $5,625 per week."	5625

He asked Morisette and Kael to bring fruit. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, and Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morisette brought. How many fruits do they have?

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so Morisette has a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette brought, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half as many oranges as Morisette brought, so Kael brought 50 - 8 = 42 oranges.

Therefore, Morisette has 13 fruits and Kael has 10 + 42 = 52 fruits."	52

Jennie helps out at her mother's place of work. She has 60 blank sheets, and a third of the blank sheets are blank. If there are 30 blank sheets now, why were they there before Jennie started?

Answer: 20

Explanation:

Let's use a simple equation to solve this problem:

Number of blank sheets before Jennie started = Number of blank sheets after Jennie started - Number of blank sheets Jennie helped with

We know that 30 blank sheets are left after Jennie started, so the number of blank sheets before Jennie started is:

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 blank sheets before Jennie started helping at her mother's place of work."	10

One hospital sees five hundred patients a day. One patient is seen every forty minutes. The doctor charges $150 an hour for the hospital and the hospital charges the patient $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital get from these visits?

Answer: $9,000

Explanation:

Let's assume that the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient takes 40 minutes to see the doctor. This means that the hospital sees 500 patients x 40 minutes/patient = 20,000 minutes of doctor time per day.

Since the doctor charges $150 per hour, the total cost of doctor time for the hospital is: 20,000 minutes/day x $150/hour = $300,000 per day.

The hospital charges the patient $200 per hour, so the revenue from doctor time is: 20,000 minutes/day x $200/hour = $400,000 per day.

The profit from these visits is: $400,000 - $300,000 = $100,000 per day.

Since the hospital sees 500 patients per day, the profit per patient is: $100,000 / 500 patients = $200 per patient."	200

Jospeh's budget in Kotonima was $500. In Ayeyohomommo, his budget was a modest $60. How much budget did he make in those two months?

Answer: $560.

Explanation:

Jospeh's budget in Kotonima was $500, and he stayed there for 2 months, so his total budget for those 2 months was $500 x 2 = $1000.

In Ayeyohomommo, his budget was a modest $60, and he stayed there for 1 month, so his total budget for that month was $60.

Therefore, Jospeh's total budget for the 2 months he spent in Kotonima and Ayeyohomommo was $1000 + $60 = $1060."	1060

There are only twenty-seven gates left in the world. One-fifth of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of the gates in Scotland are female. How many female gates are there?

Answer: 17

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the number of gates left in the world: 27.

Then, we know that one-fifth of the gates are in the Scottish Highlands, which is 5 gates.

So, the number of gates in Scotland is 27 - 5 = 22.

Since two-thirds of the gates in Scotland are female, the number of female gates in Scotland is 22 x 2/3 = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 female gates in the Scottish Highlands."	17

Mark did a test with 75 questions, and he completed 5 questions in one hour on the test. Today, he did another test with 100 questions in one hour. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions would he have missed?""

Answer: 20 questions.

Explanation:

To find out how many questions Mark missed, we need to subtract the number of questions he completed from the total number of questions on the test.

On the first test, Mark completed 5 questions in one hour, so he missed 70 questions (75 - 5).

On the second test, Mark completed 10 questions in one hour, so he missed 90 questions (100 - 10).

Therefore, Mark missed a total of 20 questions on both tests."	20

She estimates her weekly income to be $92. The profit is the difference between total income and total expenditure, so how much profit would Lucas, in dollars, make per week?

Answer: $39

Explanation:
Kim's total income from her 5 clients is $92 (2 bottles of bleach x $2 per bottle + 1 trash bag x $5 per bag).
Her total expenditure is $2 x 10 bottles of bleach = $20, and $5 x 5 trash bags = $25.
So, her profit is $92 - $20 - $25 = $39 per week."	39

Steve lives two miles away from the school, and he cycles at a speed of about 440 feet per minute. Tim lives two miles away from the school. If Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser completes the race?

Answer: 12 minutes

Explanation:
Let's assume that Steve and Tim are racing each other to school. Since Steve cycles at a speed of 440 feet per minute, and Tim skateboards at a speed of 264 feet per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to cover a mile.

Steve's time to cover a mile = distance / speed = 2 miles / 440 feet/minute = 4.5 minutes

Tim's time to cover a mile = distance / speed = 2 miles / 264 feet/minute = 7.5 minutes

Since Steve is ahead of Tim, he will reach the school first. Tim will take 7.5 minutes to cover the remaining distance, so the winner will wait at home for 7.5 minutes before the loser completes the race. Therefore, the answer is 12 minutes."	12

If the price of a bag of jewelry is $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then what is the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months?

Answer: $48

Explanation:

The original price of the bag of jewelry is $20.

After two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which is $4 (20% of $20).

So, the new price of the bag of jewelry is $24 ($20 + $4).

Repeat this process for thirty months:

$24 + (20% of $24) = $32 + $8 = $40

Therefore, the price of the bag of jewelry after thirty months is $40."	40

Answer: $65

Explanation:

If Jackie pays her own bills, she will lose $35/hour in unpaid wages. Since she works 3 hours, she will lose $105.

If she hires an accountant, she will save $90.

So, the total amount of money Jackie will make is:

$65 (savings from hiring an accountant) - $105 (lost wages from paying her own bills) = $65

Therefore, the answer is $65."	65

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $3 and sugar for $2. They sell each bottle for $0.50 and get 20 bottles for each bottle. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on the lemonade?

Answer: $15

Explanation:
Juan and Carlos sell lemonade for $3 and sugar for $2, so they make $5 per sale. Since they sell 20 bottles for each sale, they make $100 in revenue per sale. To find out how much they spent on lemonade, we can use the formula:

Profit = Revenue - Cost

In this case, the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$25 = $100 - x

Where x is the cost of the lemonade.

Solving for x, we get:

$25 = $100 - $15

So, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemonade."	15

In one race involving 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese and the rest were Chinese. If there were 60 men on the Chinese team, how many women were on the Chinese team?

Answer: 40

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of women on the Chinese team is x.

From the problem, we know that the total number of Chinese participants is 80 - 60 = 20.

So, the number of men on the Chinese team is 60 - x.

We are given that the total number of Asians is 240.

So, the number of women on the Chinese team is 20 + (60 - x) = 20 + 40 = 60.

Therefore, there are 40 women on the Chinese team."	40

There are two candidates running to represent the standards in the Sarai school. If the winner receives four-thirds of the votes, and there are eighty voting students in the class, count the number of votes the loser received.

Answer: 56

Explanation:
Let's assume the number of votes the winner receives is x.

According to the problem, the winner receives four-thirds of the votes, which means they receive 4/3 x votes.

So, the number of votes the loser receives is 80 - (4/3 x).

We can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by 3, since there are three candidates in total:

3(80 - (4/3 x)) = 3x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 80 from both sides:

24 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

182	Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five and a half years older than Jan. If Jan is thirty, how old is Jean?	23	"Answer only. 
Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five and a half years older than Jan. If Jan is thirty, how old is Jean?

Answer: 35

Explanation:

Let Mark's current age be M.

Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2.

At that time, Jan's age was 30 - 5.5 = 24.5 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is M + 2 = 35 years old."	35

Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agree to give her two percent of her monthly salary. If Mandy can pay her after three months, how much should Benedict pay?

Answer: $2.40

Explanation:
Mandy's monthly salary is $1000. Two percent of her monthly salary is $20. So, Benedict should pay $20 x 3 = $60. Since Mandy can pay her after three months, Benedict should pay $60 x 3 = $180. Therefore, Benedict should pay $180 to Mandy."	180
188	A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?	50	"Answer only. 
A merchant buys a sack of beans from a farmer for $20 a sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to the market, and the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack, how many sacks does he sell?

Answer:
The merchant sells 75 sacks of beans.

Explanation:
To find the number of sacks the merchant sells, we need to set up and solve an equation based on the information given in the problem. Let's start by using the information that the merchant makes a profit of $400 when he sells all the sacks for $30 a sack.

Profit = Number of sacks x $30 per sack

Since the merchant makes a profit of $400, and the cost of transporting each sack is $2, we can set up the equation:

$400 = Number of sacks x $30 + $2 x Number of sacks

Now we can solve for the number of sacks the merchant sells:

$400 / ($30 + $2) = Number of sacks

$400 / $32 = Number of sacks

Number of sacks = $400 / $32
Number of sacks = 75

Therefore, the merchant sells 75 sacks of beans."	75

Two hundred pounds of vegetables should be distributed to forty restaurants in a city. Each restaurant should have two pounds of vegetables. How many pounds of vegetables are not used?

Answer: 160 pounds.

Explanation:

Total amount of vegetables = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40
Amount of vegetables each restaurant receives = 2 pounds

To find the amount of vegetables not used, subtract the amount used by each restaurant from the total amount of vegetables:
160 pounds (not used) = 200 pounds - (40 restaurants x 2 pounds/restaurant)

Therefore, 160 pounds of vegetables are not used."	160

Elaine has 20 Pokemon cards at the beginning. After one month, she collects three times that amount. In two months, she collects 20 smaller cards that she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collects twice as many pokemon cards as she collected in the first and second months. How many Pokemon cards does she have now?

Answer: 120

Explanation:

In the first month, Elaine collects 3 times the number of cards she had at the beginning, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collects 20 smaller cards, which brings the total to 80 cards (60 + 20).

In the third month, she collects twice as many cards as in the first and second months, which is 2 x (60 + 20) = 120 cards.

Twenty of the twelve cups cost $1200, and a dozen of the small cups cost $6000. Imagine how much each cup would cost.

Answer: $50

Explanation:

Let's call the cost of one cup of the large cups ""x"". Since 20 of the large cups cost $1200, we can set up the equation:

20x = 1200

Now, let's find the cost of one cup of the small cups. Since a dozen of the small cups cost $6000, we can set up the equation:

12x = 6000

Now, we can solve both equations simultaneously:

20x = 1200
12x = 6000

x = $50

So, each cup of either size would cost $50."	50

Lori wants to buy $320.00 shoes and $32.00 matching belts. She works part-time and pays $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work to buy them?

Answer:
Lori has to work 40 hours to buy the shoes and belts.

Explanation:
To find out how many hours Lori has to work to buy the shoes and belts, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage.

Cost of shoes = $320.00
Cost of belts = $32.00
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00
Hourly wage = $8.00

To find out how many hours Lori has to work to buy the items, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

40 hours = $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = $44.00

Therefore, Lori has to work 40 hours to buy the shoes and belts."	40

You have 4 flowers on a blue flower. There are 7 more dahlias on the flower than on the blue flower. How many flowers are there on the blue flower?

Answer: 4

Explanation:

Let's assume the number of flowers on the blue flower is x.

Since there are 7 more dahlias on the blue flower than on the blue flower, the number of dahlias on the blue flower is x + 7.

We know that the total number of flowers on both flowers is 4 + 4 = 8.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 7 = 8

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:

2x = 1

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 1/2

Therefore, there are 4 flowers on the blue flower."	4

Jason has a 1,000-minute standing-on-the-street-to-talk schedule every month. He spends fifteen minutes a day calling his boss, and this month he spends 300 minutes calling other people. If this month has thirty days, how many minutes does Jason have left?
