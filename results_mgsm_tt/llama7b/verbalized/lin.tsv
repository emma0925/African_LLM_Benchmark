Carla is uploading a 200 GB file. She can upload at a rate of 2 GB per minute but at 40% of the upload, Windows commands a restart to set updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla should start uploading from the beginning. How long does it take to upload the file?

Answer: 40 minutes.

Explanation:
Carla can upload the file at a rate of 2 GB per minute, so it will take 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes to upload the file. However, Windows will require a restart after 40% of the upload, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to upload the file is 100 minutes - 20 minutes = 40 minutes."	40

9	For the first 40 hours of a week's work, Elisa's hourly rate is $10 per hour. For higher hours, she earns 1.2 times the hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours a week, what would her salary be?	460	"Answer only. 
For the first 40 hours of a week's work, Elisa's hourly rate is $10 per hour. For higher hours, she earns 1.2 times the hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours a week, what would her salary be?

Answer: $580

Explanation:
Elisa's hourly rate for the first 40 hours of work is $10 per hour, so her total earnings for those hours is $400 ($10 per hour x 40 hours).
For the remaining 5 hours (45 hours - 40 hours), her hourly rate is 1.2 times the hourly rate, which is $12 ($10 x 1.2). So her total earnings for those 5 hours is $60 ($12 per hour x 5 hours).
Adding her total earnings for the first 40 hours and the additional 5 hours, her total salary for the week is $580 ($400 + $60)."	60

Carlos wants to plant a Lilala tree. The cost of planting is 90$. per year, the tree can grow from 7 apples which will be sold for 1.5$ each. Watering the tree costs 3$ per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start earning money from his Lilala tree?

Answer: 5 years.

Explanation:

Carlos needs to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for 5 years to determine when he will start earning money from it.

Total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for 5 years = ($90/year x 5 years) + ($3/year x 5 years)
Total cost = $450 + $15 = $465

Since the tree can grow 7 apples per year, and each apple sells for $1.50, Carlos will earn $10.50 per year from the apples alone ($1.50 x 7 apples/year).

Therefore, it will take Carlos 465/10.50 = 44 years to start earning money from his Lilala tree.

So, the answer is 5 years."	5

Melanie works as a door-to-door salesperson. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, then sold two to the red house, then finally sold the rest to the orange house. If Melanie is left with 5 vacuum cleaners, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?

Answer: 15

Explanation:
Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, which is 15 (since 1/3 of 15 is 5). Then, she sold 2 to the red house, leaving her with 13 (since 2 is less than 15). Finally, she sold the rest (5) to the orange house, leaving her with 15 (since 5 + 13 = 18, and 18 - 5 = 15). Therefore, Melanie had 15 vacuum cleaners at the beginning."	15
14	In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?	60	"Answer only. 
In the dance class there are 20 students, 20% of them have made their name in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of hip-hop dance students?

20% of the students have made their name in contemporary dance, which means that 80% of the students have not made their name in contemporary dance.

25% of the students have made their name in jazz dance, which means that 75% of the students have not made their name in jazz dance.

So, the percentage of students who have made their name in hip-hop dance is:

75% - 80% - 25% = 50%

Therefore, 50% of the students in the dance class make their name in hip-hop dance."	50

Answer: 230 km.

I have 10 liters of apple juice made from 2 liters of water. I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made from 4 liters of water, with a soup. One liter of apple juice. How much water is in 24 liters of water?

Answer: 10 liters

Explanation:

To find the amount of water in 24 liters of mixture, we need to subtract the amount of water used to make the apple juice from the total amount of mixture.

The apple juice was made from 2 liters of water, so the amount of water in the apple juice is 2 liters.

The pineapple juice was made from 4 liters of water, so the amount of water in the pineapple juice is 4 liters.

The total amount of mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of water in the mixture is:

2 liters (apple juice) + 4 liters (pineapple juice) = 6 liters (water)

Therefore, there are 6 liters of water in 24 liters of mixture."	24

Gunter tries to count the candies in his mouth. He asks his friends to guess the number. One of them answers 80. Another says 20 more than half of the previous one. The third says 25% more than the previous one. What is their average guess?

Answer: 115

Explanation:
Gunter has 100 candies in his mouth.

Friend 1 guesses 80. So, the average guess is 80 + 80 = 160.

Friend 2 guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is 20 + 40 = 60. So, the average guess is 160 + 60 = 220.

Friend 3 guesses 25% more than 220, which is 220 x 1.25 = 275. So, the average guess is 220 + 275 = 495.

Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 495."	495

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5. How much money is lost on yogurt in 30 days?

Answer: $15

Explanation:
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.
Since they sell them for the price of 4 yogurts for $5, Terry pays $5 x 4 = $20 for 60 yogurts.
Therefore, Terry loses $20 x 30 = $600 on yogurt in 30 days."	30

jean wants to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. he made 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. in total, he bought 8 video games for $20 each, which left him with $5. how many Lego sets did he have left?

Answer: 3

Explanation:

Jean sold 13 Lego sets for a total of $15 x 13 = $195.

He then used the $195 to buy 8 video games for $20 x 8 = $160.

So, he had $195 - $160 = $35 left over.

Since he had 13 Lego sets initially, and he sold 13 of them, he must have had 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets left."	0
38	jean runs 60km every week. he runs six days a week. the first day he runs at 3 o'clock and then he runs twice a week to two different countries. what is his typing speed?	10	"Answer only. 
jean runs 60km every week. he runs six days a week. the first day he runs at 3 o'clock and then he runs twice a week to two different countries. what is his typing speed?

Answer: 100wpm

Explanation:
Jean runs 60km every week, which means he covers a distance of 60km in 1 week. Since he runs 6 days a week, his average speed can be calculated as follows:

Average speed = Total distance / Number of days
= 60km / 6 days
= 10km/day

Since Jean runs twice a week to two different countries, he spends 2 days of the week traveling. Therefore, his total time spent running per week is:

Total time = Number of days running + Number of days traveling
= 6 days + 2 days
= 8 days

Now, we need to calculate Jean's typing speed. Since he runs 8 days a week, he has 8 x 24 hours = 192 hours to spend on typing. Therefore, his typing speed can be calculated as follows:

Typing speed = Total time / Number of hours available for typing
= 192 hours / 8 days
= 24 hours/day

So, Jean's typing speed is 24 hours/day."	24
39	Dana will run four times faster than her normal walking pace, but will run twice as fast as her normal walking pace. If she runs at 3 miles per hour, how many miles has she run in six hours, given that she spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana will run four times faster than her normal walking pace, but will run twice as fast as her normal walking pace. If she runs at 3 miles per hour, how many miles has she run in six hours, given that she spent 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?

Answer: 21 miles

Explanation:
Dana runs 4 times faster than her normal walking pace, so she runs at a pace of 4 x 3 = 12 miles per hour.
She spends 1/3 of the time running, so she runs for 1/3 x 6 = 4 hours.
In the remaining 2/3 of the time, she walks at her normal pace of 3 miles per hour.
So, she walks for 2/3 x 6 = 4 hours.
In total, she has run 4 hours x 12 miles/hour = 48 miles.
Plus, she has walked 4 hours x 3 miles/hour = 12 miles.
Therefore, the total distance she has covered in 6 hours is 48 + 12 = 60 miles."	60

charlie wants to sell some beeswax candles. each pound of beeswax will allow him to make 10 candles. one pound of beeswax PE if it sells for 10,00$. silk a sali PE sold 20 candles, what is his total profit? let's say one candle sold for 2,00$

Answer:
Total profit = (Number of candles sold x Price of one candle) - Cost of one pound of beeswax
= (20 candles x $2,000) - ($10,000 / 10 candles)
= $40,000 - $1,000
= $39,000

Explanation:
Charlie sold 20 candles, which means he made $2,000 in revenue from those candles. However, he also had to pay $10,000 for each pound of beeswax he used to make those candles. Since he used 10 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles, he paid $10,000 / 10 candles = $1,000 for each pound of beeswax. Therefore, his total profit from selling those 20 candles is $2,000 - $1,000 = $39,000."	39000

Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes articles on health-related topics and sends them to clients every day. An article on her blog takes an average of 4 hours of work, depending on the search to write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times as many articles on Tuesday. Wednesday wrote twice as many articles as if she hadn't written on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the past three days.

Total number of hours = x

Where x = 4 hours (the average time spent on each article) x (the number of articles written on each day)

Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours = 20 hours
Tuesday: 2/5 x 4 hours = 2 hours
Wednesday: 2 x 4 hours = 8 hours

Total number of hours = 20 + 2 + 8 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the past three days is 30 hours."	30

Richard lives in one of the apartments in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 apartments. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, what is the total number of vacant apartments in the building?

Tom's boat is traveling at 10 miles per hour. It will sail from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., and make its way back at 6 miles per hour. How long does it take him to get back?

Answer: 2 hours

Explanation:

Tom's boat travels at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means it covers a distance of 30 miles (10 miles/hour x 3 hours).

When it turns around and heads back, it travels at 6 miles per hour for 2 hours, which means it covers a distance of 24 miles (6 miles/hour x 2 hours).

In total, it takes Tom's boat 30 + 24 = 54 miles to get back."	54

If Marcy works for a company for 40 years, she earns $50,000 per year. After 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that annual salary. Assuming she retires after 30 years of work, what would her annual salary be?

Answer: $150,000

Explanation:
Marcy's annual salary for the first 20 years of work is $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000.
After 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of her annual salary, which is $1,000,000 x 5% = $50,000.
Therefore, her total salary for the first 20 years of work is $1,000,000 + $50,000 = $1,050,000.
After 30 years of work, her annual salary would be $1,050,000 / 30 = $35,000."	35000

A treasure hunter dug up a chest full of gems. It contained 175 diamonds, 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds, and twice as many emeralds as rubies. How many gems were in the chest?

Answer: 175 diamonds

Explanation:

Let the number of rubies be x.

From the problem, we know that the number of diamonds is 175, so we can write:

175 = 35 + 2x

Subtracting 35 from both sides gives us:

140 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

70 = x

Therefore, there are 70 rubies in the chest. Since each chest contains twice as many emeralds as rubies, there are 70 x 2 = 140 emeralds in the chest."	140

Cecilia has just bought a new puppy. according to the veterinarian, she should give 1 tablespoon of food EVERY day to feed the dog EVERY day for the first 180 days. then she should give 2 bags of food EVERY day until the end of her life. If one bag of food is 110 bags, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Answer: 190 bags

Explanation:

* In the first 180 days, Cecilia should give 1 tablespoon of food EVERY day, which is equal to 190 bags of food (1 tablespoon / 110 bags = 1.73 bags/day x 180 days = 190 bags).
* After the first 180 days, Cecilia should give 2 bags of food EVERY day until the end of her dog's life, which is equal to 365 bags of food in the first year (2 bags/day x 365 days = 730 bags).

Therefore, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 190 + 730 = 920 bags."	920

Dan has planted 3 roses. One rose has 25 roses and one rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there in total?

Answer: 35

Ted the tyrannosaur is supposed to bring a turkey salad to a dinosaur picnic. He knows he needs 10 pounds for a dinosaur and a half for a baby. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of turkey salad does Ted have to bring because I expect to feed everyone?

Answer: 15 pounds

Explanation:
To determine how many pounds of turkey salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total number of dinosaurs and half-dinosaurs at the picnic. There are 20 adult dinosaurs, each needing 10 pounds of turkey salad, so that's 20 x 10 = 200 pounds. Then, there are 5 half-dinosaurs, each needing 1/2 x 10 = 5 pounds of turkey salad. Therefore, the total amount of turkey salad Ted needs to bring is 200 + 5 = 205 pounds."	205

500 hours \* $150/hour = $75,000

Now, the hospital charges $200 per hour for after-hours consultations. If 100 patients are seen after hours, the total number of hours of after-hours consultation is 100 hours.

So, the total amount charged by the hospital for after-hours consultations is:

100 hours \* $200/hour = $20,000

Therefore, the total interest charged by the hospital for these consultations is:

$75,000 + $20,000 = $35,000

So, the answer is $35,000."	35000

Yesterday, Marc took a test of 75 questions. He did it in the form of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions in the same way. If Marc took 8 hours to do the first test and 6 hours for the second, how many questions remain unanswered?

Answer: 25 questions

Explanation:
Marc took 75 questions in 8 hours, so he answered 75/8 = 9.375 questions per hour.
Marc took 100 questions in 6 hours, so he answered 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour.
The difference between the number of questions Marc answered in the two tests is:
16.67 - 9.375 = 7.30 questions.
Therefore, 75 - 7.30 = 67.70 questions remain unanswered."	67

In a candy machine, there are 22 times as many blue gummy bears as there are four times as many pink gummy bears. If there are 12 blue gummy bears, how many are pink?

Answer: 32

Explanation:

Let's say there are x pink gummy bears in the machine. Since there are 4 times as many pink gummy bears as blue gummy bears, the number of blue gummy bears is 22x.

We know that there are 12 blue gummy bears, so we can set up the equation:

22x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 32

Therefore, there are 32 pink gummy bears in the machine."	32

Johnny picked up the remaining toys in his bedroom. He dropped a 500-piece Lego set, one with 3 times the number of pieces, and the last one with 1/4 of the number of pieces. How many of the pieces did Johnny pick up?

Answer: 500

Explanation:
Johnny dropped the 500-piece Lego set, which means he did not pick it up. He also picked up a set with 3 times the number of pieces, which means he picked up 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Finally, he picked up a set with 1/4 of the number of pieces, which means he picked up 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces. Therefore, Johnny picked up a total of 1500 + 125 = 1625 pieces."	1625

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and skips at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the rider to reach him before the rider finishes the race?	4	"Answer only. 
Steve and Tim decided to see which of them would be the fastest back to school. Steve lives farther away than Tim and is able to use his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and skips at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the rider to reach him before the rider finishes the race?

Please help me understand how to solve this problem. I am having trouble figuring out how to use the information given in the problem to determine the time it will take Tim to reach Steve.

Answer: 15 minutes

Explanation:

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and skis at 440 feet per minute, which means he covers a distance of 3 miles x 440 feet/min = 1320 feet per minute.

Tim lives 2 miles from the school and skateboards at 264 feet per minute, which means he covers a distance of 2 miles x 264 feet/min = 528 feet per minute.

Since Steve is farther away from the school than Tim, it will take Steve longer to reach the school than it will take Tim. Therefore, the time it will take Steve to reach the school is longer than the time it will take Tim to reach Steve.

To find the time it will take Steve to reach the school, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get:

time = 1320 feet / 440 feet/min = 3 minutes

Therefore, it will take Steve 3 minutes to reach the school.

Since Tim is closer to the school than Steve, it will take Tim less time to reach the school than it will take Steve. To find the time it will take Tim to reach Steve, we can use the same formula:

time = distance / speed

Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get:

time = 528 feet / 264 feet/min = 2 minutes

Therefore, it will take Tim 2 minutes to reach Steve.

Since Steve and Tim are racing to the school"	2

162	If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of bills costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two days, how much will a bag of bills cost in 36 months?

Answer: $100

Explanation:

In 36 months, the starting price of a bag of bills will increase by 20% every 2 days, which means the price will increase by 20% x 2 = 40% in 1 month.

So, the price of a bag of bills after 1 month will be: $20 x 1.4 = $28

In 2 months, the price will increase by 20% again, which means the price will be: $28 x 1.2 = $33.60

In 3 months, the price will increase by 20% again, which means the price will be: $33.60 x 1.2 = $39.92

And so on...

After 36 months, the price of a bag of bills will be: $39.92 x 1.2 = $47.90

Therefore, the cost of a bag of bills in 36 months will be $47.90."	47

Answer: 5 times.

Explanation:
To make Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. To make 15 cream cakes, she needs 15 x 3 = 45 eggs. Since she already has 9 eggs from her neighbor, she needs 45 - 9 = 36 eggs more. So, she has to take care of a child 36 times to make 15 cream cakes to save her school fees."	15

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on ice cream and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on ice cream?

Answer: $21

Explanation:

Juan and Carlos sell 20 glasses of lemonade, which means they made $10 (20 glasses x $0.50 per glass). They spent $3 on ice cream for every gallon of lemonade they sold, so they spent $60 ($3 x 20 gallons). They also spent $2 on sugar, so their total cost is $60 + $2 = $62. Since they made a profit of $25, their revenue is $10 + $25 = $35. Dividing their revenue by their cost gives us the amount they spent on ice cream: $35 / $62 = $21."	21

Zaid spends 1/4 of his rent, 1/3 for his car fuel and gives the rest of the money to charity. He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly meals and $700 to his wife for household food. If Zaid earns $6,000 a month, how much money will he have left after spending and donating?

Answer: $1,300

Explanation:

Zaid spends 1/4 of his rent, which is $1,500.
He spends 1/3 of his car fuel, which is $200.
He gives the rest of the money to charity, which is $2,000.

Total amount spent = $1,500 + $200 + $2,000 = $3,700

Now, let's check how much money Zaid has left after spending and donating:

$6,000 (monthly income) - $3,700 (amount spent) = $2,300

Therefore, Zaid will have $2,300 left after spending and donating."	2300

One of the two teams is stronger and its runners will run the 400 meters in 55 seconds. The other team is weaker. The first runner runs the 400 meters in 60 seconds, and the next runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first. Based on this information, by how many seconds will the fastest team win?

Answer: 15 seconds.

Explanation:
The stronger team's first runner ran the 400 meters in 55 seconds, which means the second runner can run it in 45 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first runner).
The weaker team's first runner ran it in 60 seconds, and the second runner can run it in 45 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first runner).
Therefore, the difference in time between the two teams is 15 seconds (55 - 45 = 10).
So, the fastest team will win by 15 seconds."	15

There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. There is also a rabbit yard where they divide 20 parts of grass. No grass is used outside the store. If 160 parts of grass are divided into smaller parts, how many mice are in each house?

Answer: 16

Explanation:

Russell works in the organ house and divides the grass into organs. Let's assume he divides 100 parts of grass into organs.

The mice divide the 3 parts of the house into a set of equal size and each mouse gets 6 parts of grass. So, there are 3 x 6 = 18 mice in each house.

There are 10 houses of hamsters. One of them is alone in his house and gets 5 parts of grass. So, there are 9 houses with 18 mice each = 162 mice in total.

There is also a rabbit yard where they divide 20 parts of grass. Since no grass is used outside the store, there are 20 parts of grass divided among 0 mice, which means there are no mice in the rabbit yard.

Therefore, there are 16 mice in each house."	16

Tom plants 10 seeds a year. He cuts PE 2 seeds a year. He starts with 50 seeds. After 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead. How many seeds are left?

Answer: 20 seeds

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the number of seeds Tom has after 10 years:

10 years x 10 seeds/year = 100 seeds

Now, let's calculate the number of seeds Tom cuts each year:

2 seeds/year x 10 years = 20 seeds

So, after 10 years, 30% of the seeds are dead, which means Tom has:

100 seeds - 30% of 100 seeds = 70 seeds left

Therefore, Tom has 20 seeds left."	20

200 pounds of carrots should be distributed to 40 restaurants in Fulani Town. If each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 192 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Explanation:

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots that each restaurant will receive from the total amount of carrots that are available.

In this case, 40 restaurants will receive 2 pounds of carrots each, for a total of 80 pounds of carrots. This means that 200 - 80 = 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."	120

In the middle of March, he collected twice as many cards as he collected in the first two months. How many pokemon cards does he have now?

Answer: 120

Explanation:

In the beginning, Elain had 20 pokemon cards.

He collected three times as many cards by the end of the month, so he collected 20 x 3 = 60 cards.

In the middle of February, he collected 20 cards less than he collected in the first month, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the middle of March, he collected twice as many cards as he collected in the first two months, so he collected 40 x 2 = 80 cards.

Therefore, Elain has 80 pokemon cards now."	80

Jerry is a chicken farmer. A brown hen will lay 3 eggs a day, and a white hen will lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry will lay 42 eggs a day. If there are two more white chickens than red ones, how many brown chickens are there?

Answer: 16

Explanation:
Let's assume the total number of chickens is x. Since Jerry lays 42 eggs a day, the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens is x + 42.

From the problem statement, we know that the brown hens lay 3 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by the brown chickens is 3x.

The white hens lay 5 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs.

Since there are two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of brown chickens is 16 (since 2 more white chickens means there are 2 fewer brown chickens).

So, the total number of chickens is x = 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, there are 16 brown chickens."	16

215	Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320,000 and a belt for $32.00 if her part-time job earns her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can buy the one she wants?	44	"Answer only. 
Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320,000 and a belt for $32.00 if her part-time job earns her $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she have to work before she can buy the one she wants?

Answer: 40 hours

Explanation:
To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and belt, we need to divide the cost of the items by her hourly wage.

Cost of shoes: $320,000 / $8.00 = 40 hours
Cost of belt: $32.00 / $8.00 = 4 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 40 hours to buy the shoes and 4 hours to buy the belt."	4

218	Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so he is half as old as Zack. Calculate the average age of all three in three years' time, if Harriet is now 21 times older.	45	"Answer only. 
Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so he is half as old as Zack. Calculate the average age of all three in three years' time, if Harriet is now 21 times older.

Adrian is 3 times older than Harriet, so Adrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.

Zack is half as old as Adrian, so Zack is 63/2 = 31.5 years old.

In three years' time, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.

So the average age of all three in three years' time is 66 + 24 = 90 years old."	90

It takes Carmen 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete the southwest grid. During the week, she has completed 3 crossword puzzles and 8 southwest grids. How many hours does she spend playing these games?

Answer: 5 hours

Explanation:
Carmen takes 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle, so she spends 10 minutes x 3 = 30 minutes on crossword puzzles.
She takes 5 minutes to complete the southwest grid, so she spends 5 minutes x 8 = 40 minutes on southwest grids.
In total, Carmen spends 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games.
Therefore, she spends 70/60 = 5 hours playing these games during the week."	5

Marc has purchased a fleet of 12 cars for his company. One car will be sold for $20,000. He will pay 10% of the car tax, plus an additional $1,000 for the registration of each car. How much will he spend in total?

Answer: $236,000

Explanation:

* The cost of each car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000
* Tax on each car = $20,000 x 10% = $20,000
* Registration fee for each car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000
* Total cost = $240,000 + $20,000 + $240,000 = $500,000

Therefore, Marc will spend a total of $500,000 on the fleet of 12 cars."	12

There are 36 penguins bathing in the sun and snow. A third of them are diving and swimming in the sea. Another third will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches. How many penguins continue to bathe in the sun?

Answer: 18

Explanation:

From the problem statement, we know that a third of the penguins are diving and swimming in the sea. This means that 3/10 = 30 penguins are diving and swimming in the sea.

We also know that another third of the penguins will go into a cave to eat their sandwiches. This means that 3/10 = 24 penguins will go into the cave to eat their sandwiches.

So, the number of penguins that continue to bathe in the sun is 10 - (30 + 24) = 18."	18

Jason has a monthly phone bill of 1,000 minutes. Every day, he will talk to his boss for 15 minutes and this month, he has made 300 minutes of additional calls to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?

Answer: 700 minutes

Explanation:
Jason has a monthly phone bill of 1,000 minutes, which means he has 1,000 minutes available to use for the month.

He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, which is 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.

So, the total number of minutes used by Jason is 1,000 - 450 = 550 minutes.

Since this month has 30 days, Jason has 550 / 30 = 18 minutes left for the rest of the month.

Therefore, Jason has 700 minutes left for the month."	700

There are 4 carcasses in one aquarium and 32 in the other. The difference between the carcasses in two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish in two aquariums. If two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium x.

In the first aquarium, there are 4 carcasses, so the total number of living organisms is 4 + x.

In the second aquarium, there are 32 fish, so the total number of living organisms is 32 + x.

The difference between the two aquariums is equal to twice the increase in fish, so:

4 + x - 32 + x = 2(x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 50

x = 25

So, there are 25 fish in the first aquarium and 32 fish in the second aquarium."	32
