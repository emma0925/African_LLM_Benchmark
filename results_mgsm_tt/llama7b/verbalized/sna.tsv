5	Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new home. A pair of glasses cost $5 but buying a second pair cost 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for these glasses?	64	"Answer only. 
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for her new home. A pair of glasses cost $5 but buying a second pair cost 60% of the original price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should she pay for these glasses?

Answer: $80.

Explanation:

To find the cost of 16 glasses, we need to calculate 60% of the cost of one glass.

60% of $5 = $3

So, the cost of 16 glasses is $3 x 16 = $48.

Since each glass costs $5, the total cost of 16 glasses is $48 + (16 x $5) = $80."	80

John drives for 3 hours at 60mph and returns home after remembering that he forgot something at home. He tries to get home by 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop. He then spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, before he can drive the remaining 4 hours at 80mph. How far would he be from home by the end of 4 hours?

Answer: 2 hours

Explanation:

John spends the first 2 hours waiting for traffic to stop, which means he covers a distance of 2 hours x 60mph = 120 miles.

He then spends the middle part of the hour running at 30mph, which means he covers a distance of 1 hour x 30mph = 30 miles.

Therefore, by the end of 4 hours, John has covered a total distance of 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles from home."	150
9	Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?	460	"Answer only. 
Eliza earns $10 an hour for the first 40 hours, and if she continues to work above her work rate, she will earn more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount. If Eliza works 45 hours this week, how much will she earn?

Answer: $490

Explanation:

Eliza works for 45 hours this week, and her hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours. Therefore, she earns $400 for the first 40 hours ($10/hour x 40 hours).

For the remaining 5 hours, she earns more than $10 an hour and 1.2 times that amount, which is $12. So, she earns an additional $60 for the remaining 5 hours ($12/hour x 5 hours).

Therefore, Eliza earns a total of $490 this week ($400 + $60)."	60

12	Carlos has planted a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant, yields seven lemons a year that he sells for $1.50 each, and costs $3 to water and feed the insects.	13	"Answer only. 
Carlos has planted a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant, yields seven lemons a year that he sells for $1.50 each, and costs $3 to water and feed the insects.

What is the total revenue generated by Carlos' lemon tree each year?

Answer: $105

Explanation:
The total revenue generated by Carlos' lemon tree each year can be calculated by multiplying the number of lemons produced per year by the selling price per lemon.

Number of lemons produced per year = 7 lemons/year
Selling price per lemon = $1.50/lemon
Total revenue generated per year = Number of lemons produced per year x Selling price per lemon
Total revenue generated per year = 7 lemons/year x $1.50/lemon = $105/year"	105

14	In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?	60	"Answer only. 
In a classroom where 20 kids are learning to dance, 20% of the kids are learning modern dance, 25% of the rest are learning jazz, the rest are learning hip-hop. What percentage of the kids are hip-hop dancers?

Answer: 50%

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* 20% of the kids are learning modern dance.
* 25% of the rest are learning jazz.
* The rest are learning hip-hop.

So, the total percentage of kids learning different types of dance is:

20% + 25% + 100% = 155%

Since the total percentage is more than 100%, some kids are learning more than one type of dance. To find out the percentage of kids learning hip-hop, we can divide the number of kids learning hip-hop by the total number of kids in the classroom:

50% (kids learning hip-hop) / 155% (total percentage of kids learning different types of dance) = 50%

Therefore, 50% of the kids in the classroom are hip-hop dancers."	50

17	If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?	57500	"Answer only. 
If she worked 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a cheerleader, how much money would she make in a year?

Answer:
$30,000

Explanation:
To calculate the total hours worked in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked by the number of hours worked per week.

For teaching, she worked 50 weeks x 35 hours/week = 1750 hours
For cheerleading, she worked 15 weeks x 15 hours/week = 225 hours

Total hours worked in a year = 1750 + 225 = 2075 hours

To calculate her annual salary, we need to multiply the total hours worked by her hourly wage.

Her hourly wage for teaching is $30/hour
Her hourly wage for cheerleading is $15/hour

Annual salary = Total hours worked x Hourly wage
Annual salary = 2075 hours x $30/hour = $62,250

Therefore, she would make $62,250 in a year."	62250

Claire cooks a 3 egg omelet in the morning at breakfast. How many dozen eggs does she eat in 4 weeks?

Answer: 12 eggs

Explanation:
Claire cooks a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, which means she eats 3 eggs per day. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Claire eats 3 x 4 = 12 eggs in a month. Therefore, she eats 12 x 4 = 48 eggs in 4 weeks."	4

20	I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and I plan to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water. But when pouring, I drop one liter of orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?	15	"Answer only. 
I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and I plan to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water. But when pouring, I drop one liter of orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

Answer: 12 liters

Explanation:

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the original orange juice:

2/3 x 10 liters = 6.67 liters (water in orange juice)

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple juice:

3/5 x 15 liters = 9 liters (water in pineapple juice)

Total amount of water in the mixture:
6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters (water in mixture)

Now, let's subtract the amount of water that was dropped during pouring:

1 liter = 0.01 cubic meters

0.01 cubic meters x 24 liters = 0.24 cubic meters (water dropped)

Now, let's calculate the amount of water left in the remaining mixture:

15.67 liters - 0.24 cubic meters = 15.43 liters (water left in mixture)

Therefore, there are 12 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."	24

Cytnthia eats a portion of ice cream every night. She buys ice cream cartons. with 15 portions of ice cream per carton for $4.00 per carton. After 60 days, how much will she have spent on ice cream?

Answer: $240.00

Explanation:
Cytnthia eats a portion of ice cream every night, so she consumes 15 portions of ice cream per month (60 days). The cost of one portion of ice cream is $4.00, so the total cost of ice cream consumed by Cytnthia in one month is:

15 portions x $4.00 per portion = $60.00

Since Cytnthia consumes ice cream every night, she will have consumed a total of 60 days x 15 portions per month = 900 portions of ice cream in 60 days. The cost of 900 portions of ice cream at $4.00 per portion is:

900 portions x $4.00 per portion = $3600.00

Therefore, Cytnthia will have spent $3600.00 on ice cream in 60 days."	60

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes he scored 4 goals. In the next 20 minutes he scored 25% more goals. How many goals did Mike score in total?

Answer: 70

Explanation:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 goals, so he scored a total of 4 x 20 = 80 goals in the first half.

In the next 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more goals, which is 25% of 80 = 20 goals. So, in the second half, Mike scored a total of 80 + 20 = 100 goals.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 100 goals in the entire 40 minutes."	40
36	Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently he is making $5 for 4 yogurts. How much does he buy yogurts for 30 days?.	75	"Answer only. 
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently he is making $5 for 4 yogurts. How much does he buy yogurts for 30 days?.

Answer: $150

Explanation:
Terry currently makes $5 for 4 yogurts, so he makes $5 x 4 = $20 per day. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, he spends $20 / 2 = $10 per day on yogurt.

To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt for 30 days, we multiply the daily cost by 30: $10 x 30 = $300.

Therefore, Terry spends $300 on yogurt for 30 days."	30

39	Dana can run twice as fast as she can walk but jumps the rope at a moderate speed. If she jumps 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she walk in six hours if she walks one third of the time she runs and two thirds of the time she walks?	18	"Answer only. 
Dana can run twice as fast as she can walk but jumps the rope at a moderate speed. If she jumps 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she walk in six hours if she walks one third of the time she runs and two thirds of the time she walks?

Answer: 4.8 miles

Explanation:

Let's first determine how fast Dana runs. Since she can run twice as fast as she can walk, if she runs at a speed of x miles per hour, she can walk at a speed of 2x miles per hour.

We know that Dana jumps the rope at a moderate speed of 3 miles per hour.

We are also given that Dana walks one-third of the time she runs and two-thirds of the time she walks. This means that she runs for a total of 6 hours, and walks for a total of 4 hours (since 6 hours is the total time she spends running and walking).

So, the total distance she walks is:

Distance walked = (1/3) x (2x miles/hour) x 4 hours = 4.8 miles

Therefore, the answer is 4.8 miles."	4

Tracy used a four-foot-long piece of wire to secure the tomato stems in her garden. This wire was cut into pieces six inches long. How many pieces did they find on the wire?

Answer: 7

Explanation:
Tracy used a four-foot-long piece of wire to secure the tomato stems in her garden. This wire was cut into pieces six inches long, which means that the total length of the pieces is 6 x 6 = 36 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can divide 36 by 12 to find the number of pieces: 36 ÷ 12 = 3. Therefore, Tracy found 3 pieces of wire on the wire."	3
49	Richard lives in a 15-story building with eight rooms on each floor, three-quarters of which are now occupied.	30	"Answer only. 
Richard lives in a 15-story building with eight rooms on each floor, three-quarters of which are now occupied.
The building has 12 elevators, each of which can accommodate 6 people.
How many people can enter the building through the elevators in 10 minutes?

Answer: 720 people.

Explanation:

To find out how many people can enter the building through the elevators in 10 minutes, we need to calculate the number of elevators available and the number of people who can use each elevator in one minute.

There are 12 elevators in the building.
Each elevator can accommodate 6 people, so the total number of people who can use each elevator in one minute is 6.

Now, we need to calculate the number of minutes it takes for 10 people to enter the building through the elevators.

10 people x 6 elevators = 60 people per minute

So, in 10 minutes, 600 people can enter the building through the elevators (60 people per minute x 10 minutes).

Therefore, the answer is 720 people (600 people per minute x 10 minutes)."	10

52	Uriah's book bag has become too heavy for him. He has to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh a quarter of a pound each and his toys weigh a half pound each. If he removes the comic books, how many toys must he remove?	15	"Answer only. 
Uriah's book bag has become too heavy for him. He has to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh a quarter of a pound each and his toys weigh a half pound each. If he removes the comic books, how many toys must he remove?

Answer: 6

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the total weight of Uriah's book bag:

15 pounds = 15 x 16 ounces (since 1 pound = 16 ounces)

Now, let's find out how much each comic book weighs:

1 comic book = 1/4 pound = 4 ounces

So, the total weight of the comic books is:

4 ounces x number of comic books = 4 ounces x 5 (since there are 5 comic books) = 20 ounces

Now, let's find out how much each toy weighs:

1 toy = 1/2 pound = 8 ounces

So, the total weight of the toys is:

8 ounces x number of toys = 8 ounces x 6 (since there are 6 toys) = 48 ounces

Now, let's find out how many toys Uriah must remove to reduce the weight of his book bag by 15 pounds:

48 ounces - 20 ounces = 28 ounces

Since 28 ounces is equal to 1 pound, Uriah must remove 1 pound of toys from his book bag to reduce its weight by 15 pounds. Therefore, he must remove 6 toys from his book bag."	6

Fourth, a mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Fifth, a mechanic fixed 12 car tires but no truck tires. How much money did he make on the day he earned the most money in his career?

Answer: $240.

Explanation:

The mechanic charged $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. Since he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, he earned a total of $60 x 6 = $360 for truck tires and $40 x 4 = $160 for car tires. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned on the day he earned the most money in his career is $360 + $160 = $520."	520

John keeps a dog. He takes it to a dog groomer for $100. The dog groomer gives him a 30% commission for attracting his new customer. How much does it cost to groom a dog?

Answer: $70

Explanation:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John keeps a dog and takes it to a dog groomer for $100.
2. The dog groomer gives John a 30% commission for attracting his new customer.
3. To find out how much it costs to groom a dog, we need to subtract the commission from the original price.

So, the cost of grooming a dog is:

$100 - (30% of $100) = $100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, it costs $70 to groom a dog."	70

The company pays each employee $600 per month. The company has a policy to increase the salaries of each employee by 10% of the starting salary for those employees who have been in the job for five years.

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles in two seconds when Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet and increased his speed by 10%. If Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, say, how many seconds would Gerald run the 400-meter hurdles, as his diet was increased?

Answer: 34 seconds.

Explanation:
Let's assume that Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles was x seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles in two seconds less than Gerald, Lee's time was x - 2 seconds.

According to the problem, Gerald increased his speed by 10%, which means that his new time for the 400-meter hurdles would be x + 10% of x.

So, Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles would be:

x + (10% of x) = 38 seconds

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 3.8x = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 34 seconds

Therefore, Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles in 34 seconds after increasing his speed by 10%."	10

In the community, domestic rabbits are 12 less than dogs and cats combined. If there are two cats for every dog, there are 60 dogs. How many animals are kept for entertainment in the community?

Answer: 180

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Domestic rabbits are 12 less than dogs and cats combined.
* There are 60 dogs in the community.
* There are two cats for every dog.

Now, let's use the information to find the number of cats in the community:

Dogs = 60
Cats = 60 x 2 = 120

Now, we know that the total number of animals kept for entertainment in the community is 120 + 60 = 180.

Therefore, the answer is 180 animals are kept for entertainment in the community."	180
95	Of the 200 fifth graders, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?	40	"Answer only. 
Of the 200 fifth graders, 2/5 of the boys and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not in Girl Scouts?

Answer: 40

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying the number of boys and girls in Girl Scouts.

2/5 of the boys are Girl Scouts, so the number of boys in Girl Scouts is 2/5 x 100 = 40 boys.

2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts, so the number of girls in Girl Scouts is 2/3 x 100 = 67 girls.

Therefore, the number of girls who are not in Girl Scouts is 100 - 67 = 33 girls."	33

Jennie is helping in her mother's office. She has a stack of 60 letters that need to be stamped, and a stack of letters that have already been stamped. She stamps one-third of the letters that need to be stamped. If there are 30 letters in the stack that need to be stamped, how many were in the stack before Jennie started?

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of letters in the stack that need to be stamped before Jennie started. Then, we know that 1/3 of the letters in the stack were stamped by Jennie, so the number of letters stamped by Jennie is 3x.

We are also given that there are 30 letters in the stack that need to be stamped, so the total number of letters in the stack is x + 30.

Now, we can set up an equation using these values:

x + 30 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 - 30

x = -10

So, there were 10 letters in the stack before Jennie started stamping."	10

Explanation:

To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from patient visits. The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of patients seen per day by the charge per patient visit.

Total revenue = Number of patients seen per day x Charge per patient visit
= 500 patients/day x $200/hour
= $100,000/day

Next, we need to subtract the total cost of providing these services. The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of patients seen per day by the cost per patient visit.

Total cost = Number of patients seen per day x Cost per patient visit
= 500 patients/day x $150/hour
= $75,000/day

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $100,000/day - $75,000/day
= $25,000/day

Therefore, the hospital makes $25,000 in profit per day from patient visits."	25000

Nissa hires 60 workers each season to work as carpenters in her local Santa shop. A third of the carpenters leave work by vomiting, the remaining 10 carpenters leave work by hiding in the pot. How many carpenters are left?

Answer: 30

Explanation:

A third of the carpenters leave work by vomiting, which means 20 carpenters vomit (2/3 x 60 = 40).
The remaining 10 carpenters leave work by hiding in the pot.
So, the total number of carpenters left is 30 (40 - 10)."	10
131	Joseph's expenditures in May were $500, and in June they dropped to $60.	940	"Answer only. 
Joseph's expenditures in May were $500, and in June they dropped to $60.
What was Joseph's average monthly expenditure for the two months?

Average monthly expenditure = Total expenditure / Number of months

In this case, the total expenditure for the two months is:

$500 + $60 = $560

And the number of months is:

2 months

So, Joseph's average monthly expenditure for the two months is:

$560 / 2 months = $280

Therefore, Joseph's average monthly expenditure for the two months was $280."	280

John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and antiseptic for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, how much are all his purchases worth?

Answer: $22.30

Explanation:

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3
* Cups: $3
* Antiseptic: $4

Total cost without tax: $15

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $15 = $1.50

Total cost with tax: $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

Therefore, John's purchases are worth $22.30 ($16.50 + 10% tax)."	10

145	John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every three months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?	4000	"Answer only. 
John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every three months. How many pineapples can John harvest in a year?

Answer: 1000 pineapples

Explanation:

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares John has. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, John can harvest 100 x 10 = 1000 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, he can harvest 1000 x 10 = 10,000 pineapples in a year."	10000

Steve and Tim decide to see who is the fastest to get home. Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to use his bike, Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can ride his bike 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, how long will it take the winner to finish the race from his home?

Answer: 7 minutes

Explanation:

Steve lives 3 miles from the school, which means he has to cover a distance of 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet. Since he can ride his bike 440 feet per minute, it will take him 15840 / 440 = 35.5 minutes to reach his home.

Since Tim lives 2 miles from the school, he has to cover a distance of 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet. Since he rides his skateboard 264 feet per minute, it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40.5 minutes to reach his home.

Since Steve is allowed to use his bike, he will finish the race in 35.5 minutes, which is the fastest time."	35

Answer: 20.

Explanation:

Dave ate 14 French fries before being snatched by the seagull. The seagull ate half as many as Dave, which is 7 French fries. Then, three cockroaches came and ate 3 French fries each, which is 9 French fries. Finally, a raccoon stole one-third of the remaining potatoes, which is 5 French fries.

In total, there were 14 + 7 + 9 + 5 = 35 French fries eaten or stolen. Since Dave bought a large bag of French fries, there must have been 20 French fries in the bag."	20

162	If a bag of marble costs $20 and its price increases by 20 percent every two months, how much will a bag of marble be worth after 36 months?	92	"Answer only. 
If a bag of marble costs $20 and its price increases by 20 percent every two months, how much will a bag of marble be worth after 36 months?

A) $40
B) $60
C) $80
D) $100

Answer: B) $60.

Explanation:

After 2 months, the price of the bag of marble will increase by 20 percent, so it will cost $24 (20 x 1.2).

After 4 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $28.80 (24 x 1.2).

After 6 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $33.60 (28.80 x 1.2).

After 8 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $39.20 (33.60 x 1.2).

After 10 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $45.92 (39.20 x 1.2).

After 12 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $53.72 (45.92 x 1.2).

After 14 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $61.64 (53.72 x 1.2).

After 16 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $69.64 (61.64 x 1.2).

After 18 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $77.72 (69.64 x 1.2).

After 20 months, the price will increase again by 20 percent, so it will cost $86.04 (77.72 x 1.2).

Therefore, after 36 months, the price of a bag of marble will be $8"	8

Jessica is trying to figure out how to pay off all her bills each month. Her student loans are at least $300 a month, her credit card is at least $200 a month, and her mortgage is at least $500 a month. If Jessica is willing to pay 50% more than the mortgage, how much does she pay per year?

Answer: $600

Explanation:
To find out how much Jessica pays per year, we need to calculate how much she pays per month and then multiply that by 12.

Jessica pays at least $300 per month on her student loans, $200 per month on her credit card, and $500 per month on her mortgage. If she is willing to pay 50% more than the mortgage, that means she pays $500 x 1.5 = $750 per month on her mortgage.

Therefore, Jessica pays a total of $300 + $200 + $750 = $1250 per month.

If she pays $1250 per month, she pays $1250 x 12 = $15,000 per year."	15000

How long does it take Billy to finish making a potato?

Answer: 
Minutes

Explanation:

To find out how long it takes Billy to finish making a potato, we need to multiply the number of potatoes he has to make (60) by the time it takes him to beat one potato (1 minute and 30 seconds).

60 x 1 minute and 30 seconds = 60 minutes

So, it takes Billy 60 minutes to finish making a potato salad for the family barbecue."	60

Two candidates are competing to represent a class at a school in Sarai. If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes which the total number of schoolchildren who voted in the class was 80, find the number of votes the loser got.

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let the number of votes the loser got be x.

From the problem, we know that the total number of votes in the class is 80.

So, the number of votes the winner got is 3/4 of 80 = 60.

We also know that the number of votes the loser got is less than 60, since the winner got 60 more votes than the loser.

So, the number of votes the loser got is 60 - x.

We are also given that the number of votes the loser got is less than 80, since the total number of votes in the class is 80.

So, we can set up the equation: 60 - x < 80.

Solving for x, we get: x < 20.

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."	20

187	Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agree to a 2% monthly interest rate on the loan. If Mandy is able to pay it off in 3 months, how much should she give Benedict?	106	"Answer only. 
Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agree to a 2% monthly interest rate on the loan. If Mandy is able to pay it off in 3 months, how much should she give Benedict?

Answer: $104

Explanation:

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which means the interest owed each month is 2% of the original amount owed. In this case, the original amount owed is $100, so the monthly interest is $2 (2% of $100).

To find the total amount owed after 3 months, we multiply the original amount owed by the monthly interest rate: $100 x 2% = $2. So, the total amount owed after 3 months is $100 + $2 = $102.

Since Mandy is able to pay off the loan in 3 months, she will give Benedict $102."	102

191	A duck needs about two pounds [3.5 kg] of rice per week to survive. If there are ten ducks, how many pounds of rice do they need per day?	5	"Answer only. 
A duck needs about two pounds [3.5 kg] of rice per week to survive. If there are ten ducks, how many pounds of rice do they need per day?

Rice is the staple food for ducks. They eat about 25% of their body weight in rice every day. So, a duck that weighs two pounds (0.9 kg) needs about half a pound (0.25 kg) of rice per day.

Therefore, ten ducks that weigh a total of 20 pounds (9 kg) need about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of rice per day."	4
192	Tom plants 10 trees a year. Each year he also cuts down two trees a year. He starts with 50 trees, after 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?	91	"Answer only. 
Tom plants 10 trees a year. Each year he also cuts down two trees a year. He starts with 50 trees, after 10 years 30% of the trees die. How many trees are left?

Answer: 20 trees

Explanation:
Tom plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years he has 100 trees (10 x 10 = 100).
He cuts down 2 trees a year, so after 10 years he has cut down 20 trees (2 x 10 = 20).
After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, so he has 70 trees left (100 - 30 = 70).
Therefore, there are 20 trees left."	20

196	Carrots weighing 200 pounds are distributed to 40 convenience stores, each store receiving two pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots are left unused?	120	"Answer only. 
Carrots weighing 200 pounds are distributed to 40 convenience stores, each store receiving two pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots are left unused?

Answer: 198 pounds

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Carrots weighing 200 pounds are distributed to 40 convenience stores.
* Each store receives two pounds of carrots.

To find the total amount of carrots distributed, we can multiply the number of stores by the amount of carrots each store receives:

200 pounds / 40 stores = 5 pounds per store

So, 40 stores receive 5 pounds of carrots each, for a total of 200 pounds.

Now, we are asked how many pounds of carrots are left unused. To find this, we subtract the amount of carrots distributed from the total weight of carrots:

200 pounds - 200 pounds = 0 pounds

There are no pounds of carrots left unused. All 200 pounds are distributed to the convenience stores."	200

Eklaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards. A month later, he has collected three times that number. In the second month, he has collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. In the third month, he has collected twice the number of Pokémon cards he collected in the first and second months combined. How many Pokémon cards has he now collected altogether?

Answer: 100

Explanation:

In the first month, Eklaine collected 20 Pokémon cards, so he had 20 + 20 = 40 cards in total.

In the second month, he collected 3 times 40 = 120 cards. So, he had 40 + 120 = 160 cards in total.

In the third month, he collected 2 times (160 - 20) = 140 cards. So, he had 160 + 140 = 300 cards in total.

Therefore, Eklaine has collected 300 Pokémon cards altogether."	300

John won a prize at work. The prize consists of a one-time payment of $5000 and a 5% increase in his salary. If he earns 2000 a week, a week off a year and he earned a salary on the first day of the year, how much does he make in a year?

Answer: $104,000

Explanation:

John's salary before the prize was $2000 a week, or $104,000 a year.

The prize consists of a one-time payment of $5000, which is added to his salary.

So, John's new salary after the prize is:

$104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

Since John also gets a 5% increase in his salary, his new salary is:

$109,000 x 1.05 = $114,450

Therefore, John makes $114,450 a year after winning the prize."	114450

Jerry has his chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Each day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Answer: 3

Explanation:
Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, Jerry collects 3x eggs per day.
Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:
3x = 42

Now, we know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so the number of white chickens is x + 2. Since the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, Jerry collects 5(x + 2) eggs per day.

Now we have two equations:
3x = 42
5(x + 2) = 42

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 3
So Jerry has 3 red chickens."	3

Lori wants to buy a pair of $320 shoes and a matching belt for $32.00 shoes. Her salary is $8.00 an hour. How many hours does she want to work before she can afford to buy?

Answer: 40 hours

Explanation:
To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then divide it by her hourly wage.

Total cost = $320 + $32 = $352

Hourly wage = $8.00

Number of hours worked = $352 / $8.00 = 45 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 45 hours to afford the shoes and belt."	45

If she were to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over during those 12 months?

Janet is planning to pay $165 a month for 12 months to buy a computer that costs $1,995. How much money will Janet have left over during those 12 months?

Answer: $1,830

Explanation:

To find out how much money Janet will have left over during the 12 months, we need to subtract the total amount she will pay ($1,995 x 12 = $23,940) from the amount she will pay each month ($165 x 12 = $1,990).

Therefore, Janet will have $1,830 left over during the 12 months ($23,940 - $1,990 = $1,830)."	1830

Mike used to correspond with 5 people. He stopped associating with 2 of them. Each of them wrote 2 letters a week of 5 pages. He responds freely. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Answer: 14 hours

Explanation:

Mike used to correspond with 5 people. He stopped associating with 2 of them, so now he corresponds with 3 people.

Each of the 3 people writes 2 letters a week, each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds freely.

Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, so it takes him 6 minutes to write one page.

To calculate the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to multiply the number of letters he receives by the number of pages in each letter and the time it takes him to write one page.

Number of letters he receives = 3 people x 2 letters per person per week = 6 letters per week
Number of pages in each letter = 5 pages per letter
Time it takes Mike to write one page = 6 minutes

Total time Mike spends writing a week = Number of letters he receives x Number of pages in each letter x Time it takes him to write one page
= 6 letters per week x 5 pages per letter x 6 minutes per page
= 14 hours per week

Therefore, Mike spends 14 hours per week writing letters."	14

There are 4 reefs in the aquarium and 32 in the aquarium, The difference in the number of reefs in the two areas is twice the number of fish in the two areas. If the aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each area?

Answer: 16

Explanation:
Let's call the number of fish in the area with 4 reefs x. Since the difference in the number of reefs is twice the number of fish, we can write:

x + 4 - 2x = 32

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 32

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in each area."	16

On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her brother; on Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies; her brother ate five cookies on Monday and 13 the next day; if one cookie contained 200 calories, how much more did Sue eat?

Answer: 800 calories.

Explanation:

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her brother, so she ate 4 x 13 = 52 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her brother, so she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.
Her brother ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so he ate a total of 9 cookies.

Since one cookie contains 200 calories, Sue ate a total of 52 + 26 = 78 cookies, which is 800 calories more than her brother."	800
