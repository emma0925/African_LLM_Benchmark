Janet's parents are celebrating on Sunday, November 16th. In the morning, they eat three cookies and use the rest to make muffins for their friends. The rest, she sells the next day for her chicken soup that she purchased 2 pounds of a new chicken. How much (in dollars) will she make the next day for her chicken soup?

Answer: $4.50.

Explanation:
Janet's parents ate 3 cookies in the morning, and they used the rest to make muffins for their friends. Let's assume that each cookie costs $0.50 and each muffin costs $1.50. So, they made $3 in muffins.

The next day, they sold the rest of the cookies and muffins, which is $3. They also sold the chicken they purchased for $2 per pound, so they made $4 for the chicken soup.

Therefore, Janet made a total of $4.50 for her chicken soup the next day ($3 + $4)."	4
1	one piece of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric and half the amount of white fabric. how many layers of fabric do we need for the whole piece of clothing	3	"Answer only. 
one piece of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric and half the amount of white fabric. how many layers of fabric do we need for the whole piece of clothing

Answer:
We need half the amount of white fabric for the whole piece of clothing.

Explanation:

The problem statement says that one layer of clothing requires two layers of thin fabric and half the amount of white fabric. To find the total amount of fabric needed for the whole piece of clothing, we need to apply this proportion to the whole piece of clothing.

So, the total amount of fabric needed for the whole piece of clothing is half the amount of white fabric."	-1

Josh owns a home improvement business. He buys an 80,000-square-foot house and then invests $50,000 into the food business. The sale of the house increased the business by 150%. How much did the business benefit?

Answer: $75,000

Explanation:

First, find the original value of the business before Josh invested $50,000:

Original value = 80,000 square feet x $150% increase = $120,000

Next, find the new value of the business after Josh invested $50,000:

New value = $120,000 + $50,000 = $170,000

Therefore, the business benefited by $75,000 ($170,000 - $120,000)."	120000

10	A new procedure is repeated 60 times in the first month. The number of repetitions in the second month is three times more than in the previous month. Then the calculation is repeated for the remaining 30% in the third month. After all, how many times do we repeat the procedure in three months?	366	"Answer only. 
A new procedure is repeated 60 times in the first month. The number of repetitions in the second month is three times more than in the previous month. Then the calculation is repeated for the remaining 30% in the third month. After all, how many times do we repeat the procedure in three months?

Answer: 60 x 3 = 180

Explanation:

In the first month, the procedure is repeated 60 times.

In the second month, the number of repetitions is three times more than in the previous month, so it is 60 x 3 = 180.

In the third month, the remaining 30% of the procedure is repeated 30/100 = 9 times.

Therefore, the total number of times the procedure is repeated in three months is 60 + 180 + 9 = 259."	259

carlos wants to plant a single lemon tree. the average annual yield is 90 f. a year a tree will produce about 7 lemons that we will harvest if it costs 1.5 f per ton. the life expectancy of the tree is 3 f years. how many years does carlos have to wait for his lemon tree to be able to generate income.

Answer: 
Carlos has to wait for 3 years for his lemon tree to generate income.

Explanation:

The life expectancy of the tree is 3 years, which means that it will take 3 years for the tree to reach its full potential and start producing lemons.

In the first year, the tree will not produce any lemons as it is still in the growing phase. In the second year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, but since it is the first year of production, Carlos will not be able to harvest any lemons. In the third year, the tree will produce 7 lemons again, and Carlos will be able to harvest them.

Therefore, Carlos has to wait for 3 years for his lemon tree to be able to generate income."	3

15	A seller chooses between two options: buy a piece of furniture that costs $5000 or buy a piece of furniture that costs $8000. if the seller calculates a financial gain of 2.5% on the sale of a piece of furniture as well as 1.2% on the sale of a piece of furniture in a month, if the seller makes a decision to increase the price of a piece of furniture to make money in the next month, how much will his profit increase?	125	"Answer only. 
A seller chooses between two options: buy a piece of furniture that costs $5000 or buy a piece of furniture that costs $8000. if the seller calculates a financial gain of 2.5% on the sale of a piece of furniture as well as 1.2% on the sale of a piece of furniture in a month, if the seller makes a decision to increase the price of a piece of furniture to make money in the next month, how much will his profit increase?

Answer: $1200.

Explanation:
The financial gain on the sale of a piece of furniture is calculated as follows:

Financial gain = Cost of furniture x Percentage gain

For the piece of furniture that costs $5000, the financial gain would be:

Financial gain = $5000 x 2.5% = $125

For the piece of furniture that costs $8000, the financial gain would be:

Financial gain = $8000 x 1.2% = $96

If the seller increases the price of a piece of furniture by $1000, the new price would be:

New price = Old price + Percentage increase

New price = $5000 + 20% = $6000

The profit on the sale of the piece of furniture would be:

Profit = New price - Cost of furniture

Profit = $6000 - $5000 = $1000

Therefore, the seller's profit would increase by $1000 if they increase the price of a piece of furniture by $1000."	1000
16	Two buses travel to San Rafael in one hour. We continue to drive to the end of the tunnel and then they both run about 80 miles. The next day, they travel to the end of the tunnel for about 150 miles. What is the distance between the buses that ran those two days?	230	"Answer only. 
Two buses travel to San Rafael in one hour. We continue to drive to the end of the tunnel and then they both run about 80 miles. The next day, they travel to the end of the tunnel for about 150 miles. What is the distance between the buses that ran those two days?

Answer: 75 miles.

Explanation:

On the first day, the buses traveled to San Rafael in one hour, which means they traveled at a rate of 60 miles per hour. Since they traveled for 80 miles, they must have started 20 miles away from San Rafael.

On the second day, the buses traveled to the end of the tunnel for about 150 miles. Since they started from the same location as the previous day, the distance between the buses is 75 miles."	75
17	Jill's tuition is $20 an hour, and Bud's tuition is $30 an hour. If she works 35 hours a week teaching and 15 hours a week caring for the kids, how much does she make a year?	57500	"Answer only. 
Jill's tuition is $20 an hour, and Bud's tuition is $30 an hour. If she works 35 hours a week teaching and 15 hours a week caring for the kids, how much does she make a year?

Answer: $35,700.

To calculate Jill's annual income, you can multiply her weekly hours worked by her hourly rate:

35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week
15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week

Total weekly income: $1,150

To calculate her annual income, you can multiply her total weekly income by 52 weeks in a year:

$1,150/week x 52 weeks/year = $60,100/year

So, Jill makes $60,100 per year."	60100

one of the drill holes has collapsed to a depth of about 2 centimeters per hour. how many centimeters does the drill hole miss when measured from 13H to 17H?

Answer: 4 centimeters.

Explanation:

The drill hole collapses at a rate of about 2 centimeters per hour, so over a period of 5 hours (from 13H to 17H), the drill hole has collapsed by a total of:

2 cm/h x 5 h = 10 cm

Therefore, the drill hole misses 4 cm (10 cm - 6 cm) from 13H to 17H."	17

The other says he gave half as much as the one who gave 20. The third says he gave 25% more than the one who gave? What is the number of half as much as they gave?

Answer: 40.

Explanation:

Let the number of holes in each hole be x.

Gunter asked his friends to calculate the number of holes in the hole.

One of them said 80, which means they gave 2x as much as Gunter.

The other said they gave half as much as the one who gave 20, which means they gave 2x/2 = x/2 as much as Gunter.

The third said they gave 25% more than the one who gave 20, which means they gave (20/100)x = 4x as much as Gunter.

So, the number of holes in each hole is 40."	40

Jean wanted to sell all the furniture and then used the money to buy video games, including 13 lego games, which she sold for $15 each. Finally, she bought 8 video games that sold for $20 each, which sold for $5 each. How many lego games are there?

Answer: 13

Explanation:

Jean sold 13 Lego games for $15 each, which means she made $195 from those games. Then, she bought 8 video games that sold for $20 each, which means she spent $160 on those games. So, she had $35 left over. Since each of the 8 video games sold for $20, she sold 8 x $20 = $160 worth of video games, leaving her with $35 - $160 = -$125.

Therefore, there are 13 Lego games."	13
38	Jean runs 60 miles a day every week. She runs 3 times a week. The first day she ran for 3 hours, the other two times she ran twice as little. Is Lann her doctor?	10	"Answer only. 
Jean runs 60 miles a day every week. She runs 3 times a week. The first day she ran for 3 hours, the other two times she ran twice as little. Is Lann her doctor?

Answer: No.

Explanation:
Jean runs 60 miles a day every week, which means she runs a total of 60 x 7 = 420 miles per week.
Since she runs 3 times a week, she runs a total of 420 / 3 = 140 miles per day.

On the first day, she ran for 3 hours, which means she ran for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.
On the other two days, she ran for 140 / 2 = 70 minutes each day.

So, Lann is not Jean's doctor."	70

Charlie wants to sell his meat-packing boxes. A hundred meat-packing boxes will make him make 10 brown meat-packing boxes. A book of meat-packing boxes costs $10. Since he makes and sells 20 meat-packing boxes, how many people know that a meat-packing bowl costs $2.00?

Answer: 5

Explanation:

Charlie makes and sells 20 meat-packing boxes, which means he earns $200 in total. Since each meat-packing box costs $10, Charlie spends $200 / $10 = 20 boxes of meat-packing boxes to make and sell.

Since a hundred meat-packing boxes will make him make 10 brown meat-packing boxes, Charlie has 200 - 10 = 190 meat-packing boxes left.

Since a book of meat-packing boxes costs $10, Charlie has 190 / $10 = 19 books of meat-packing boxes left.

Since 20 meat-packing boxes are sold, 20 / 19 = 1 person knows that a meat-packing bowl costs $2.00."	2

* Jean bought the red carpets for twice the price of the red carpets, which means she paid $2x for the red carpets.
* The red carpets were 50% more expensive than the red carpets, which means the price of the red carpets was $2x/2 = $1x.
* Jean bought the red carpets for $200, which means she paid $1x for the red carpets.
* Jean bought the red carpets for $40 each, which means she bought a total of $40x = $400 worth of red carpets.

Therefore, Jean bought a total of $400 worth of red carpets."	400

A large luggage carrier is preparing to sell a luxury car that costs less than 5000 livres. A large carrier made of identical boilers whose design costs 15 livres each. If you add the driver's design and the empty carrier together, it costs 3755 livres. How many boilers can we make a large car that does not exceed its capacity?

Answer: 15

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The luxury car costs less than 5000 livres.
* The large luggage carrier is made of identical boilers whose design costs 15 livres each.
* The driver's design and the empty carrier together cost 3755 livres.

Now, let's solve the problem:

We want to make a large car that does not exceed its capacity, so we need to find the number of boilers that can be made without exceeding 5000 livres.

The cost of each boiler is 15 livres, so the total cost of n boilers is 15n.

We know that the driver's design and the empty carrier together cost 3755 livres, which is less than the capacity of the car (5000 livres).

So, we can set up the following equation:

15n < 3755

Now, we can solve for n:

15n < 3755
n < 250

Therefore, we can make 15 boilers without exceeding the capacity of the car."	15

Stéphane buys a piece of fruit from a vending machine. His bill for all the lime he buys is $40.00 . but in order to convince him to stay, he increases the price of our bill by 25% so he increases the price by $3.00 that same year. Stéphane may raise the price by $4.00 that same year. If we calculate the price of everything, how much did Stéphane save?

Price of a piece of fruit = $40.00
Price of a piece of fruit after 25% increase = $40.00 x 1.25 = $50.00
Price of a piece of fruit after 25% increase and additional $4.00 increase = $50.00 x 1.25 = $60.00

Stéphane saved = $60.00 - $40.00 = $20.00"	20

A jeweler opened a jewelry box. The box contained 175 diamond rings, 35 rubies more than twice the size of diamonds and emeralds more than twice the size of rubies. How many jewelry boxes were there?

Answer: 35

Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* The jeweler opened a jewelry box. (This means there are multiple jewelry boxes.)
* The box contained 175 diamond rings. (This means there are 175 jewelry boxes in total.)
* The number of rubies in each jewelry box is more than twice the number of diamonds. (This means the total number of rubies in all jewelry boxes is 35 + 2 \* 175 = 35 + 350 = 385.)
* The number of emeralds in each jewelry box is more than twice the number of rubies. (This means the total number of emeralds in all jewelry boxes is 35 + 2 \* 385 = 35 + 770 = 805.)

So, there are 175 jewelry boxes in total."	175

If in one area, the number of households exceeds the number of households of twelve if you add the number of dogs to the number of cats. if in one area there are two cats and sixty dogs, how many households are there in the area?

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the answer to the question:

There are 68 households in the area.

Explanation:
If there are 2 cats and 60 dogs, then the total number of pets is 62 (2 + 60). If the number of households exceeds the number of dogs by 12, then there must be 12 households in total. Therefore, the number of households in the area is 68 (12 + 56)."	56

Jean has 3 boyets. One boyet is 5×6×4. The sides are 1 inch wide. How many boyets can three boyets make together?

Answer: 12

Explanation:
To find out how many boyets three boyets can make together, we need to find the total volume of all three boyets.

The first boyet has a volume of 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches.
The second boyet has a volume of 6 x 7 x 4 = 140 cubic inches.
The third boyet has a volume of 8 x 9 x 4 = 120 cubic inches.

So, the total volume of all three boyets is: 120 + 140 + 120 = 480 cubic inches.

Since the sides of each boyet are 1 inch wide, the total volume of all three boyets in cubic inches is: 480 / 12 = 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, three boyets can make 40 cubic inches of volume."	40

Julia's boat sank and she found herself in the river. The boat began to sink 2 liters of water that flowed ten feet towards the shore. It took eleven minutes for the boat to sink. The shore was 64 feet deep, how many liters of water did the boat sink?

Answer: 136 liters

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. The boat sank and Julia found herself in the river.
2. The boat began to sink 2 liters of water that flowed ten feet towards the shore.
3. It took eleven minutes for the boat to sink.
4. The shore was 64 feet deep.

Now, let's use the information to find the answer:

1. The boat sank 11 minutes, so it sank 11 x 60 = 660 feet.
2. Since the boat sank 2 liters of water per minute, it sank 2 x 660 = 1320 liters of water.
3. Since the shore was 64 feet deep, the boat sank to a depth of 64 feet + 1320 liters = 1984 feet.

Therefore, the boat sank 1984 liters of water."	1984

In a heat exchanger, there are more than twenty-two times the number of shallow cylinders and four times the number of shallow cylinders. If there are twelve shallow cylinders, how many shallow cylinders are there?

A) 22
B) 4
C) 12
D) 24

Answer: C) 12

Explanation:

Let's say the number of shallow cylinders is x.

From the problem, we know that there are more than 22 times the number of shallow cylinders, so:

x > 22x

We also know that there are four times the number of shallow cylinders, so:

x > 4x

Now, we can solve the system of inequalities:

x > 22x
x > 4x

x = 12

So, there are 12 shallow cylinders in the heat exchanger."	12

Billy cooks and cuts potatoes for his brother's big barbecue. As an important event, he has 60 potatoes to cook. The potatoes are quick enough, so the time to cook them and cut them is the same. Billy needs about the same amount of chicken and shrimp to cook the potato, but 5 pieces of chicken to cut it. How much time does Billy need to make the potato?

Time = Distance / Speed

Distance = 60 potatoes x 0.5 kg = 30 kg

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. So each of us spends $3 on mangoes and $2 on sugar. We have 20 months of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 each month. If we make a bond of $25, how much will it cost to buy the mangoes?

Answer: $25 / 20 = $1.25 per month

Explanation:
Juan and Carlos sell lemonade for $0.50 each month. They have 20 months of lemonade.
To make the mangoes, they spend $3 each. So, they spend $3 x 20 = $60 on mangoes.
They also spend $2 on sugar. So, their total cost for mangoes and sugar is $60 + $2 = $62.
Since they make a bond of $25, the cost of buying mangoes is $25 / 20 = $1.25 per month."	1

In a rally that gathered 240 Asians, 80 of them were shepherds, and the rest were Chinese. If the number of men in the Chinese group was 60, how many women were in that group?

Answer: 20

Explanation:

Let's assume that the number of men in the Chinese group is x.

From the problem statement, we know that the number of men in the Chinese group is 60.

So, the number of women in the Chinese group is x - 60.

Since there are 80 Chinese people in total, the number of women in the Chinese group is 80 - (x - 60) = 20.

Therefore, there were 20 women in the Chinese group."	20

Zaid used 1/4 of his salary to pay for his apartment, 1/3 to pay for his wife and then gave it to his favorite charity fundraiser. He gave $200 to his daughter for her weekly medical expenses, and then $700 to his wife for toiletries and other household items. Since Zaid earns $6,000 a month, would you ask him to pay for the wedding and then give him all of that and everything else?

Answer: No, Zaid would not be able to pay for the wedding and everything else.

Explanation:

Zaid used 1/4 of his salary to pay for his apartment, which means he has $1500 left after paying for his apartment. Then, he gave $200 to his daughter for her weekly medical expenses, which means he has $1300 left. Finally, he gave $700 to his wife for toiletries and other household items, which means he has $630 left.

Adding up all of these amounts, Zaid has a total of $2530 left after paying for his apartment, his daughter's medical expenses, and his wife's toiletries and household items. This is still less than the $6000 that he earns per month, which means he would not be able to pay for the wedding and everything else."	6000

Sandra, who is shaking a piece of paper next to her, is very upset by the incompleteness of the paper that Fred has unrolled. Sandra has unrolled more than 4 times on red paper than on white paper. She has also unrolled 200 lists of colors, which is five times the amount of white paper. Sandra threatens to leave the seller if the seller doesn't return her with 17 hours of red paper left. While Sandra is at her clinic, which of the red papers does Sadra have to unroll before 17 hours?

Answer: 12 hours

Explanation:
Sandra has unrolled more than 4 times on red paper than on white paper, so she has unrolled 4 x 12 = 48 red papers. Since she has also unrolled 200 lists of colors, which is five times the amount of white paper, she has unrolled 5 x 12 = 60 white papers. Therefore, Sandra has to unroll 48 - 60 = -12 red papers before 17 hours. However, since Sandra cannot unroll negative red papers, she has to unroll 12 hours of red paper to reach 17 hours."	17

a salesman buys bags from a farmer for $20 each. If you take a bag from the farm to the store for $2, and all the bags are sold for $30 each to get a bonus of $400, how many bags do you sell?

Answer: 40 bags.

Explanation:

The salesman buys bags from the farmer for $20 each, so he spends a total of $20 x 10 = $200 on the bags.

If he takes a bag from the farm to the store for $2, then he has $200 - $2 = $198 left.

If he sells each bag for $30, he will make a profit of $30 x 10 = $300. So, his total profit is $198 + $300 = $498.

Since he sold 10 bags, his bonus is $498 / 10 = $49.8 per bag."	49

197	The population of the village of Soda is 23786, of which 8 417 are men and 9092 are women. The rest are children. How many children does Soda have?	6277	"Answer only. 
The population of the village of Soda is 23786, of which 8 417 are men and 9092 are women. The rest are children. How many children does Soda have?

Population of Soda = 23786
Men in Soda = 8417
Women in Soda = 9092

To find the number of children in Soda, we can subtract the number of men and women from the total population:

Children in Soda = 23786 - 8417 - 9092 = 15287

Therefore, Soda has 15287 children."	15287

Finally, during the third month, she collected twice as many as she had in the first two months. How many Pokemon cards have you collected now?

Answer: 40

Explanation:

In the first month, Elaine had 20 cards, so she collected more than 3 times that amount = 20 x 3 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected more than 20 cards than she had in the first month = 60 + 20 = 80 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice as many as she had in the first two months = 80 x 2 = 160 cards.

She went to another store and bought there 5 times more than she bought cakes. So, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cakes in the third store.
In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 86 cakes in 3 days."	3

Jerry hunts a tiger. Red tigers hunt three tigers a day, white tigers hunt five a day. Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day. If the number of white tigers is more than the number of red tigers, how many red tigers are there?

Answer: 21

Explanation:

Let the number of red tigers be x.

According to the problem, the number of white tigers is 5x.

Jerry hunts 42 tigers a day, so the total number of tigers hunted is 5x + 42.

Since the number of white tigers is more than the number of red tigers, we can say that x < 21.

So, the number of red tigers is 21."	21

Janet owed $2,000 and then promised to pay back 10% of what she owed. If she owed $165 a month for 12 months, how much money would Janet have left over?
