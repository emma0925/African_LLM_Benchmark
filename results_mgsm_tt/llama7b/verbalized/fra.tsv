1	A dress requires two rolls of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.	3	"Answer only. 
A dress requires two rolls of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.
A suit requires three times as much white fiber as a dress.
A blouse requires twice as much white fiber as a dress.
How much white fiber will be required for a suit and a blouse?

Answer:
Suits require 3 times as much white fiber as dresses, so the white fiber required for a suit is 3 x 2 = 6 times the amount of white fiber required for a dress.
Blouses require twice as much white fiber as dresses, so the white fiber required for a blouse is 2 x 6 = 12 times the amount of white fiber required for a dress."	12

Kylar goes to the store in order to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but each second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay to buy them?

Answer: $128

Explanation:
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and each glass costs $5. So, the total cost of the 16 glasses is:

16 glasses x $5/glass = $80

However, each second glass costs only 60% of the price, so the cost of the second glass is:

$5/glass x 60% = $3

So, the total cost of the 16 glasses is:

$80 + (16 x $3) = $128

Therefore, Kylar will have to pay $128 to buy the 16 glasses."	16

For the first 40 hours of work a week, Elisa's hourly rate is $10. For her overtime hours, she also receives 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. If Elisa worked 45 hours this week, what will her weekly wage be?

A new program was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times that of the first month. It then decreased by 30 percent in the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded in those three months?

Answer: 180

Explanation:

In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times.
In the second month, the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, so it was 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.
In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30 percent, so it was 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads.
In total, the program was downloaded 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 times in those three months."	366

Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The cost of planting is 90 dollars. Each year, the tree will produce seven lemons that will be sold for $1.5 each. Watering and nurturing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?

Answer: 6 years

Explanation:

Year 1: $90 (planting cost)
Year 2: $90 + $3 = $93 (watering and nurturing cost)
Year 3: $93 + $3 = $96 (watering and nurturing cost)
Year 4: $96 + $3 = $99 (watering and nurturing cost)
Year 5: $99 + $3 = $102 (watering and nurturing cost)
Year 6: $102 + $3 = $105 (watering and nurturing cost)

In Year 6, Carlos will start making money as the tree will produce 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each, generating $10.50 in revenue. Therefore, it will take Carlos 6 years to start making money with his lemon tree."	6

A merchant hesitates between two buying plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates on a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronics market during the same month. If the merchant makes a choice that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would that profit be?

Answer: $2,000

Explanation:
The profit from the jewelry purchase can be calculated as follows:

Profit from jewelry = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125

The profit from the electronics purchase can be calculated as follows:

Profit from electronics = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96

Since the merchant is choosing between the two options, the total profit from both purchases is:

Total profit = Profit from jewelry + Profit from electronics = $125 + $96 = $221

Therefore, the merchant's profit at the end of the month would be $2,000 ($221 x 9)."	9

Grandma Jones prepared five apple pies for the firemen's lunch. She then cut each pie into eight pieces and arranged the five pies on the buffet table for everyone to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after all the guests had taken and eaten their pies, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces did the guests take?

Answer: 70

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones prepared: 5 pies x 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces of pie.

Since the guests took and ate some of the pies, there are now 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we can divide the number of remaining pieces by the number of guests: 14 pieces / 5 guests = 2.8 pieces per guest.

Since you can't have a fraction of a piece of pie, we can round up to the nearest whole number: 2.8 pieces per guest = 3 pieces per guest.

So, the guests took 3 x 5 = 15 pieces of pie in total."	15

Tom's boat is traveling at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 to 4 p.m., then makes the return trip at the speed of 6 miles per hour. How long will it take him to get back?

Answer: 2 hours

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, we need to find the distance traveled by Tom's boat during the trip from 1 to 4 p.m. Let's assume that the distance traveled during this time is x miles.

Then, we need to find the time it took Tom's boat to travel this distance at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, if it took Tom's boat x hours to travel x miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour, then we can set up the equation:

x = Time / Speed

Now, let's find the distance traveled by Tom's boat during the return trip at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Let's assume that the distance traveled during this time is y miles.

Then, we need to find the time it took Tom's boat to travel this distance. We can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, if it took Tom's boat y hours to travel y miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour, then we can set up the equation:

y = Time / Speed

Now, we can use the information given in the problem to solve for the time it will take Tom's boat to get back. We know that Tom's boat traveled a total distance of 20 miles (10 miles x 2 hours). So, we can set up the equation:

20 = x + y

Where x is the distance traveled during the first trip and y is the distance traveled during the return trip.

Solving for y, we get:

y = 20 - x

Now, we can substitute the value of x (10 miles) into the equation:

y = 20 - 10

y = "	10

If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she receives a pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Assuming that she resigns after 30 years of service, what will her annual pension be?

Please help me with this problem. I'm having trouble figuring out how to calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service.

Answer:
Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $62,500.

Explanation:
To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, you need to calculate the pension amount for each of the 20 years she worked before resigning, and then add up those amounts.

For the first 20 years of work, Marcy is entitled to 5% of her annual pension amount, or $25,000 per year.

For the last 10 years of work, Marcy is entitled to 5% of her annual pension amount, or $31,250 per year.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
$25,000 (for the first 20 years) + $31,250 (for the last 10 years) = $56,250 per year.

Rounding up to the nearest dollar, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $62,500."	62500

Sophie is contemplating a car trip and wonders how far she can travel with just one full tank of gas. She has done 100 miles since the last fill up and had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill the tank. The user manual says her tank has a capacity of 12 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can Sophie travel with just one full tank of gasoline?

Answer: 80 miles.

To find out how many miles Sophie can travel with just one full tank of gasoline, we need to use the information provided in the problem:

1. Sophie has done 100 miles since the last fill-up.
2. She had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill the tank.
3. The user manual says her tank has a capacity of 12 gallons of gasoline.

We can start by subtracting the amount of gasoline she added (4 gallons) from the total distance traveled (100 miles):

100 miles - 4 gallons = 96 miles

Next, we can divide the total distance traveled (96 miles) by the capacity of her tank (12 gallons):

96 miles ÷ 12 gallons = 80 miles

Therefore, Sophie can travel 80 miles with just one full tank of gasoline."	80

Jim spends two hours watching TV, then decides to go to bed and read for half the time he spends watching. He repeats this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks?

Answer: 8 hours

Explanation:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours, then reads for half the time he spent watching (2 hours / 2 = 1 hour). He repeats this process three times a week, so in one week, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 3 hours reading.

In four weeks, Jim repeats this process 16 times (4 weeks x 3 times per week = 16 times). Therefore, he spends 8 hours watching TV and 12 hours reading in four weeks."	12

A treasure hunter dug up a chest full of precious stones. It contained 175 diamonds, 35 rubies less than the amount of diamonds, and twice as many emeralds than rubies. How many precious stones were in the chest?

Answer: 175

Explanation:

Let's use the information given in the problem to find the total number of precious stones in the chest.

1. The chest contained 175 diamonds.
2. There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
3. The number of emeralds was twice the number of rubies.

Now, let's use these statements to find the total number of precious stones in the chest:

Total number of diamonds = 175
Total number of rubies = 35 - 35 = 0
Total number of emeralds = 2 x 0 = 0

So, the total number of precious stones in the chest is 175."	175

There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, how many teachers are there?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

There are twice as many boys as girls, so there are twice 60 = 120 boys.
Since there are 5 students per teacher, there are 120 / 5 = 24 teachers.

Therefore, there are 12 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."	12
69	Bailey has a certain amount of money to start with, and then she gets a weekly allowance of $5 for eight weeks, and if she ends up with a total of $100 at the end of the eight weeks, how much money did Bailey start with?	60	"Answer only. 
Bailey has a certain amount of money to start with, and then she gets a weekly allowance of $5 for eight weeks, and if she ends up with a total of $100 at the end of the eight weeks, how much money did Bailey start with?

Answer: $90.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem. Bailey has a certain amount of money to start with, and she gets a weekly allowance of $5 for eight weeks. If she ends up with a total of $100 at the end of the eight weeks, then the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of the eight weeks is $100.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Total amount of money = Starting amount + Weekly allowance x Number of weeks

In this case, the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of the eight weeks is $100, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

$100 = $90 + $5 x 8

To solve for the starting amount of money, we can simplify the equation:

$90 = $5 x 8

Therefore, Bailey started with $90."	90

116	Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13. Calculate how many teaspoons she poured, knowing that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.	42	"Answer only. 
Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13. Calculate how many teaspoons she poured, knowing that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

Answer: 20 teaspoons.

Explanation:

Let's use the ratio given in the problem to find out how many teaspoons Katy poured. We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so for every 7 teaspoons of water, Katy used 13 teaspoons of sugar.

We also know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water. Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up the following equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20x = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 6

So, Katy poured 6 teaspoons of sugar. Since sugar is 7 times more concentrated than water, Katy poured a total of 42 teaspoons of water (6 x 7 = 42)."	42

There are only 27 unicorns left in the world. A third of them are in the Highlands of Scotland. Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. How many Scottish unicorns are there?

Answer: 16

In a candy machine, there are 22 times as many blue gum balls as there are four times as many pink gum balls. If there are 12 blue gum balls, how many roses are there?

Answer: 48

Explanation:

Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of pink gum balls. Since there are 22 times as many blue gum balls as there are four times as many pink gum balls, the number of pink gum balls is 4 times 22 = 88.

Now, we know that there are 12 blue gum balls, so the total number of gum balls is 12 + 88 = 100.

Since there are 100 gum balls in total, and 48 are blue, there are 52 gum balls that are not blue (pink). Therefore, there are 52 roses."	52

142	Jordan spends two hours a day playing video games. He also has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make in a week if his playing time was spent working?	140	"Answer only. 
Jordan spends two hours a day playing video games. He also has a part-time job that pays him $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan make in a week if his playing time was spent working?

Answer: $140

To find out how much money Jordan would make in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends playing video games by his hourly wage from his part-time job. Since Jordan spends two hours a day playing video games, that means he spends 14 hours (2 hours/day x 7 days/week) working. If his hourly wage from his part-time job is $10, then he would make $140 in a week ($10/hour x 14 hours/week)."	14

Steve and Tim decide to see which of the two will get home from school faster. Steve lives further away than Tim and therefore has the right to use his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and pedals at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim travels on a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: 20 minutes

Explanation:
Steve lives 3 miles from the school, which means it takes him 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 6.8 minutes to travel that distance.
Tim lives 2 miles from the school, which means it takes him 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 7.6 minutes to travel that distance.
Since Steve lives further away than Tim, he will finish the race first. The winner will wait 7.6 - 6.8 = 0.8 minutes at home before the loser finishes the race. Therefore, the answer is 20 minutes."	20

There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is eight, what is the total age of the four birds?

Answer: 100 years.

Explanation:

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 3 + 3 = 6 years older than Granny Red.

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 4 = 8 years older than Sally Four.

Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is 32 + 4 = 36 years old.

Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, the total age of the four birds is 36 + 8 = 44 years."	44

Jessica wonders how much money she has to pay each month to cover all of her debts. The minimum payment on her student loan is $300 a month, her credit card is $200 a month, and her mortgage is $500 a month. If Jessica wants to pay 50 percent more than the minimum, how much does she have to pay in a year?

Answer: $2,700.

Explanation:
To find out how much Jessica has to pay in a year, we need to calculate the total minimum payments she has to make each month. The minimum payment on her student loan is $300, plus the minimum payment on her credit card is $200, plus the minimum payment on her mortgage is $500. So, the total minimum payment each month is:

$300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000

If Jessica wants to pay 50 percent more than the minimum, she has to pay:

$1,000 x 1.5 = $1,500

So, Jessica has to pay $1,500 each month to cover all of her debts. In a year, she will have to pay:

$1,500 x 12 = $18,000

Therefore, the answer is $2,700."	2700

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For every gallon they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 a glass. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Answer: $21

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the cost of the lemons:

Lemons cost $3/gallon x 20 glasses = $60

Now, let's find the cost of the sugar:

Sugar cost $2/gallon x 20 glasses = $40

Total cost = $60 + $40 = $100

Profit = $25

So, Juan and Carlos spent $100 on lemons and sugar to make $25 in profit."	25

Sue lives in a neighborhood where there is a good mood. During one weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on her. On Friday morning, they placed 18 plastic flamingos in her garden. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back a third of the flamingos they had painted white and placed them in Sue's garden. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic flamingos were there than white flamingos?

Answer: 27

Explanation:

On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 plastic flamingos in Sue's garden.
On Saturday morning, they took back a third of the flamingos they had painted white and placed them in Sue's garden, which is 6 flamingos (since 1/3 of 18 is 6).
So, on Saturday morning, there were 18 - 6 = 12 plastic flamingos in Sue's garden.
On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 plastic flamingos to the collection, so there were 12 + 18 = 30 plastic flamingos in Sue's garden at noon on Sunday.
Since the white flamingos are 6 in number, the difference between the total number of plastic flamingos and the number of white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.
Therefore, there were 24 more plastic flamingos than white flamingos in Sue's garden at noon on Sunday."	24

We have to distribute 200 pounds of carrots to 40 restaurants in a certain city. If each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Answer: 10 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Explanation:

Total amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40
Amount of carrots each restaurant will receive = 2 pounds

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we can subtract the amount each restaurant will receive from the total amount of carrots:
200 pounds - (40 x 2 pounds) = 10 pounds

Therefore, 10 pounds of carrots will not be used."	10

In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23,786 inhabitants. 8,417 of them are men and 9,092 are women. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many children are there in Soda?

Answer: 15,277

Explanation:

Let's start by identifying the number of men and women in Soda:

Men: 8,417
Women: 9,092

Now, we know that the total population of Soda is 23,786, so the number of children in Soda is:

Children: 23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092 = 15,277

Therefore, there are 15,277 children in the city of Soda."	15277

Finally, during the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. How many Pokemon cards does she now have?

Answer: 120

Explanation:

1st month: Elaine collected 3 times as many cards, so she collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards.

2nd month: Elaine collected 20 fewer cards, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

3rd month: Elaine collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months, so she collected 2 x (60 + 40) = 120 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 120 Pokemon cards."	120

There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. A third of them dive and swim in the ocean. Another third go inside the cave to eat their dinner there. How many penguins continue to sunbathe?

Answer: 12

Explanation:

From the problem statement, we know that 36 penguins are sunbathing in the snow.

* A third of them dive and swim in the ocean, which means 12 penguins (since 36 / 3 = 12) dive and swim in the ocean.
* Another third go inside the cave to eat their dinner there, which means 12 penguins (since 36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the number of penguins that continue to sunbathe is 12."	12

Answer: 50 pens.

Explanation:
Ram uses many pens, so he has a lot of empty pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens, he will have 25 x 5 = 125 empty pens. By mixing the ink of these empty pens, he can create 125 new pens. Therefore, Ram will have a total of 125 + 5 = 130 pens."	130

The building has three entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. If, after a meeting, 30 percent of the students leave the building through exit A, 3/5 through exit B, and the rest through exit C, calculate the number of students who left the building through exit C.

Answer: 15

Explanation:
Let the total number of students in the building be x.

From the given information, we know that 30% of the students left through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A is 0.3x = 30.

We also know that 3/5 of the students left through exit B, so the number of students who left through exit B is 3/5 x = 60.

Finally, the remaining students left through exit C, so the number of students who left through exit C is x - 30 - 60 = 15.

Therefore, the number of students who left the building through exit C is 15."	15
240	Jack has six more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does he have than Jack?	21	"Answer only. 
Jack has six more candies than Robert. John has twice as many as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does he have than Jack?

Answer: 24

Explanation:
Let's start by using the information that Jack has six more candies than Robert. So, if Robert has x candies, Jack has x + 6 candies.

We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies.

Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 2x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 24

Therefore, John has 24 more candies than Jack."	24

248	A chef bought four bags of onions at 50 pounds each. If a pound of onions costs $1.50, how much did he spend?	300	"Answer only. 
A chef bought four bags of onions at 50 pounds each. If a pound of onions costs $1.50, how much did he spend?

Answer: $600.

Explanation:
The number of bags of onions the chef bought is 4.
The weight of each bag of onions is 50 pounds.
The cost of one pound of onions is $1.50.
To find out how much the chef spent, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost of one pound of onions:
4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds of onions
200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $600 to buy four bags of onions."	600
