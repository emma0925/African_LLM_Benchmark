Welcome to the African_LLM_Benchmark repository! This repository contains code and results related to my contributions to the IrokoBench project, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in African languages. IrokoBench is part of a broader effort to address the underrepresentation of African languages in NLP research by providing comprehensive benchmarks for 16 low-resource African languages across three tasks: Natural Language Inference (AfriXNLI), Mathematical Reasoning (AfriMGSM), and Multi-choice Knowledge-based QA (AfriMMLU). The paper is currently under review by NeurIPS 2024. We have received 3 out of 4 reviews so far, with scores of 6, 6, and 5.
