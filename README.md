Welcome to the African_LLM_Benchmark repository! This project is focused on evaluating and benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on African languages using various tasks, including Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM), and Natural Language Inference (NLI). The repository contains all the code and results necessary to reproduce the benchmarks and assess the performance of LLMs across these tasks.
