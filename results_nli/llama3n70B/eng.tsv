The premise talks about the biosphere coconstructing itself in a survivable regime, but it doesn't explicitly mention temperature as the factor influencing the biosphere's changes. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that temperature is the factor driving the biosphere's changes. There's no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements.
