The answer is ""entailment"". The premise states that ""Nangona kunjalo, ubunjineli bokuqala benziwe ngaphambili"", which means that some kind of engineering was already done in the past.

The statement ""U-Omnia vincit amor"" is a Latin phrase and does not directly relate to the given premise and hypothesis about Brit Hume and Lewinsky. Therefore, it is irrelevant and cannot be used to determine whether the answer is entailment, contradiction, or neutral. 

The premise states that Brit Hume is a journalist who works for Fox News, while the hypothesis suggests that he is the leading journalist for Fox News. This implies that the premise is not necessarily a direct statement about the hypothesis, and therefore, does not create any logical contradiction or entailment. Thus, the answer is neutral.<eos>"	entailment
