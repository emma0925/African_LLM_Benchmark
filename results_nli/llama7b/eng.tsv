PREMISE: day care  two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center
HYPOTHESIS: They do let them go more than twice a week if the senior citizens are up to it.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral. The premise and hypothesis do not directly address each other, so there is no logical relationship between them. The premise mentions day care for seniors, while the hypothesis refers to the general policy of allowing seniors to go beyond twice a week. There is no contradiction or entailment between the two."	neutral

HYPOTHESIS: It comes by fast but I kinda know where it may be coming from.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral

Explanation: The premise and hypothesis do not provide enough information to determine whether they entail or contradict each other. The premise simply states that the person is unsure where the idea comes from, while the hypothesis suggests that they have a general idea of where it may be coming from. Without more context or information, it is impossible to determine whether the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is neutral."	neutral

PREMISE: and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but
HYPOTHESIS: It comes like molasses and I know exactly when it will be coming.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral. The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis, but it does provide additional information that may make the hypothesis less accurate. The premise suggests that the phenomenon may not be as predictable as the hypothesis implies, and may come from an unknown source. However, this information does not necessarily disprove the hypothesis, and may simply provide additional context or complexity to the situation."	neutral

Answer: Entailment

Explanation: The premise provides evidence that a shooting occurred near the speaker's house, which entails the hypothesis that the speaker is scared to go outside. The premise provides direct evidence that the shooting was close to the speaker's house, which supports the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is entailment."	entailment
