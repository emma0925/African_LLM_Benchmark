0	Well, I wasn't thinking about him, but I was very disappointed, and, well, I started talking to him again.	i never spoke to him again.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction.

In Yoruba, I would say: ""Ọ́ tí ṣẹ́ẹ́"" meaning ""It is not correct"" or ""It is a contradiction""."
1	Well, I wasn't thinking about him, but I was very disappointed, and, well, I started talking to him again.	i was so upset that i started talking to him again.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say it's an **entailment**. The premise implies that the speaker was upset (disappointed) and started talking to him again, which aligns with the hypothesis."
2	Well, I wasn't thinking about him, but I was very disappointed, and, well, I started talking to him again.	we had a good talk.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is: neutral.

The premise mentions being disappointed and starting to talk to him again, but it doesn't directly imply whether the conversation was good or bad. The hypothesis assumes a positive outcome, but the premise doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny it."
3	They told me that I had finally found a man, as I called him.	I have not been told anything about contacting anyone.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!) 

The answer is: contradiction."
4	They told me that I had finally found a man, as I called him.	i was told that someone would be summoned to meet me.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is NEUTRAL. The premise talks about finding a man, while the hypothesis mentions someone being summoned to meet the speaker. The two statements don't seem to be directly related or contradictory."
5	They told me that I had finally found a man, as I called him.	The man came a little late.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral."
6	you have much to say about him.	i want to tell you everything i know about it!	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Kungani"" (it's neutral). The premise talks about having much to say about ""him"", while the hypothesis is about wanting to tell everything about ""it"". The subjects don't match, so there's no direct entailment or contradiction."
7	you have much to say about him.	I didn't talk about it, although there was a lot to cover.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction."
8	you have much to say about him.	I won't talk about the history of the city because there is so much to tell.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!) In isiZulu, I'd say ""Ngithola ukuthola!"" (I understand!)

Now, let's analyze the premise and hypothesis. The premise mentions having much to say about someone, while the hypothesis talks about not discussing the city's history due to the abundance of information.

In this case, I'd say the relationship is NEUTRAL. The premise and hypothesis are unrelated, and one doesn't necessarily imply or contradict the other."
9	so i'm not sure why.	I'm sure why.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction."
10	so i'm not sure why.	I don't know why he skipped school.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
12	I was the only one who ran the controls for the experiment at low altitude.	I didn't like the fact that I was the only one running the controls for the challenges.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is neutral."
13	I was the only one who ran the controls for the experiment at low altitude.	Experiments were conducted in rooms at low altitudes	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
14	I was the only one who ran the controls for the experiment at low altitude.	There were a few of us doing controls for the experiment.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction"
15	"Rick says, ""I'm, uh, a retired army officer""."	i am still working to this day.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction."
16	"Rick says, ""I'm, uh, a retired army officer""."	I retired in 2002.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral."
17	"Rick says, ""I'm, uh, a retired army officer""."	Rick told you I'm retired.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
18	There are some cash flow forecasts on my desk and, um, ah, it's for that and that February, that's the name of the client.	A client named katie earns $10,000 a month.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

The premise talks about cash flow forecasts on a desk and mentions a client named February, but it doesn't provide any information about Katie or her monthly earnings, so it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
19	There are some cash flow forecasts on my desk and, um, ah, it's for that and that February, that's the name of the client.	I have a client named katie.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

The premise doesn't provide any information that confirms or denies the existence of a client named Katie. It only mentions a client named ""February"", which is not the same as Katie."
20	There are some cash flow forecasts on my desk and, um, ah, it's for that and that February, that's the name of the client.	we do not have a customer named kathy.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

The premise talks about a cash flow forecast for a client named February, but it doesn't provide any information about a customer named Kathy. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
21	The girl who can help me is across town.	the girl you need help for lives far away.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kulungile, ngoba ipremise ibonisa ukuthi ingane engikhwazile ukuthemba ukuthola ukusebenza kuye, futhi iphutha libonisa ukuthi ingane engikhwazile ukuthemba ukuthola ukusebenza kuye iphakeme kakhulu."" (It's correct, because the premise shows that the girl I need help from is far away, and the hypothesis also shows that the girl I need help for lives far away.)"
22	The girl who can help me is across town.	The girl who helped me is 5 miles away.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
23	The girl who can help me is across town.	no one can help me.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction"
24	But they were divided as to who were field workers and who were house children, and he was like this:	all agreed to work in the field.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction"
25	But they were divided as to who were field workers and who were house children, and he was like this:	they could not agree on who should be in the field and who should be in the house.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: entailment"
26	But they were divided as to who were field workers and who were house children, and he was like this:	they could not agree on who should work in the cotton fields and who should sweep the floors.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: entailment"
27	I mean, like, they only had five kids, one died.	all their children survived.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction."
28	I mean, like, they only had five kids, one died.	one of the five children died.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: entailment."
29	I mean, like, they only had five kids, one died.	the dead baby had been born sick.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

In Yoruba, I would say: ""O dara o"" (It's okay).

The premise only mentions that one of the five kids died, but it doesn't provide any information about the cause of death or the baby's health at birth, so it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
30	she said tears were running down her eyes, and then joe came on the porch.	tears welled up in her eyes as she told him to go out on the porch.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is: neutral.

The premise talks about tears running down her eyes and then Joe coming on the porch, while the hypothesis describes tears welling up in her eyes as she tells him to go out on the porch. The two statements don't directly support or contradict each other, so the relationship is neutral.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Kungani ukuthi kunezinkinga ezingeni"" (It's like there's no connection between the two statements)."
31	she said tears were running down her eyes, and then joe came on the porch.	She quickly wiped away her tears after Joe threw her over the counter.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say it's a **neutral** relationship. The premise mentions tears and Joe's arrival, but it doesn't provide any information about Joe throwing her over the counter or her wiping away tears. The hypothesis introduces new, unrelated information, so there's no entailment or contradiction."
32	she said tears were running down her eyes, and then joe came on the porch.	She quickly wiped away her tears after Joe cheated on her on the ice.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is NEUTRAL. The premise doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis."
33	Although the plane is on fire, why would it be on fire, it is burning and melting through the body of the lead, which emits radiation.	radiation can also be controlled during a fire.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is NEUTRAL. The premise describes a situation where radiation is emitted, but it doesn't provide any information about controlling radiation during a fire, which is the focus of the hypothesis."
34	Although the plane is on fire, why would it be on fire, it is burning and melting through the body of the lead, which emits radiation.	After the plane burns, radiation is emitted from the body of the lead.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
35	Although the plane is on fire, why would it be on fire, it is burning and melting through the body of the lead, which emits radiation.	the radiation does not escape during a fire.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis.

The premise states that the plane is on fire, and the lead is melting, emitting radiation. The hypothesis claims that the radiation does not escape during a fire.

In this case, the premise contradicts the hypothesis. The premise suggests that radiation is being emitted, while the hypothesis states that it does not escape during a fire.

So, the answer is: contradiction.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for the question!"
36	This is Clem Francis, a retired major general from the United States Air Force.	The commander-in-chief is retired from the US Air Force.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kungani ukuthi kune-entailment, ukucophelela, okanye ukungani?"" (Why is it not entailment, contradiction, or neutral?)

The premise only introduces Clem Francis, a retired major general, but it doesn't provide information about the commander-in-chief, so we can't conclude anything about the hypothesis."
37	This is Clem Francis, a retired major general from the United States Air Force.	The chief officer retired a few weeks ago.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In this case, the answer is neutral. The premise provides information about Clem Francis being a retired major general, but it doesn't specify when he retired, so it neither confirms nor contradicts the hypothesis that he retired a few weeks ago."
38	This is Clem Francis, a retired major general from the United States Air Force.	U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff takes office this week.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: entailment"
50	And that sounds like exactly what I'm trying to do.	i'm trying to finish my project next week.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say the relationship is: neutral.

The premise doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis. It only expresses agreement with an unspecified goal, which might or might not be related to finishing a project next week.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for asking!"
51	But nevertheless, the animals are slaughtered regularly, especially the goats.	the goats escaped from the pen each day.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction."
55	the doors were locked when we entered.	they had the keys.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral.

In Zulu, ""Angikho"" (I don't know) would be a more detailed response, as the premise only talks about the doors being locked, but it doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis that they had the keys."
56	the doors were locked when we entered.	the doors were locked, but we managed to get inside.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
57	So I just had to take the total and try and guess.	i'm sure i just need the numbers to solve this problem.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is entailment."
59	So I just had to take the total and try and guess.	i meditate based on the totality.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say the relationship between them is... neutral.

The premise talks about taking a total and making a guess, while the hypothesis mentions meditating based on the totality. Although both mention ""total"" or ""totality,"" the actions and contexts are different, so there's no direct entailment or contradiction."

The answer is entailment.

In Yoruba, I would say: ""Oriki ti o ba ti"" (The premise supports the hypothesis).

In Swahili, I would say: ""Kauli inaunga ukweli"" (The statement supports the truth).

In Zulu, I would say: ""Isiqalo siyavumelana"" (The premise agrees with the hypothesis)."
64	yes, it's very nice when it rains	it is nice and rainy.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

66	Oh, what is the value of human life and whether or not it is possible to make someone recover	All lives are worth recovering and getting a second chance.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise is asking about the value of human life and the possibility of recovery, which aligns with the hypothesis that all lives are worth recovering and getting a second chance.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Kubonga ukuthola ukuthi iphakamiso liyavunyelwa iphakamiso."" (It is good to see that the premise supports the hypothesis.)

So, the answer is: entailment."
67	Oh, what is the value of human life and whether or not it is possible to make someone recover	no one deserves to recover.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: contradiction.

In Zulu, I'd say: ""Kungenzeka ukuthi kuqondiswe"" (It cannot be agreed upon)."
68	Oh, what is the value of human life and whether or not it is possible to make someone recover	life is worth living, not recovering.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that the relationship between them is CONTRADICTION.

The premise is asking about the value of human life and the possibility of recovery, implying that recovery is a desirable outcome. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that life is worth living, but not recovering, which suggests that recovery is not important or possible. These two statements have opposing views, hence the contradiction.

In Zulu, we would say ""Kungapheli"" (it contradicts)."

78	Yes, people who can be at work at any time, or people whose decisions can be blurred if they have to	yes, humans may not be able to make the best judgment call.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that it's an **entailment**. The premise suggests that certain individuals may have impaired judgment due to their work schedule or circumstances, which supports the hypothesis that humans may not be able to make the best judgment call.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Kulungile, ngicabanga ukuthi yi-entailment."" (That's correct, I think it's an entailment.)"
79	Yes, people who can be at work at any time, or people whose decisions can be blurred if they have to	Yes, people who do not feel hungry	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship is NEUTRAL. The premise talks about people's work schedule and decision-making, while the hypothesis mentions people who don't feel hungry. There is no logical connection between the two, so they don't entail or contradict each other.

In Zulu, I would say: ""Kungani ukuthi kunezinkinga ezingeni"" (There is no connection between the two statements)."
80	Yes, people who can be at work at any time, or people whose decisions can be blurred if they have to	Yes, people whose decision-making skills are not impaired at all.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say the relationship between them is **contradiction**.

In the premise, it's mentioned that people's decisions can be ""blurred,"" implying that their decision-making skills might be impaired. However, the hypothesis states that people's decision-making skills are ""not impaired at all."" These two statements contradict each other.

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say the relationship is: entailment.

The premise mentions ""I don't know where it came from"", which is also present in the hypothesis. The hypothesis adds more information (""but it's fast""), but the core uncertainty about the origin is maintained. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis."
100	And uh but if it came out of nowhere I don't know where it came from but	it's coming soon, but i know where it's coming from.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say it's a contradiction.

In the premise, the speaker expresses uncertainty about the origin of something, while in the hypothesis, the speaker claims to know where it's coming from. These two statements are mutually exclusive, hence the contradiction.

Ngiyabonga (Thank you) for asking!"
101	And uh but if it came out of nowhere I don't know where it came from but	it comes like a molasses and i know exactly when it will come.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that the relationship between them is a **contradiction**.

The premise suggests that the origin of ""it"" is unknown, while the hypothesis claims that the speaker knows exactly when ""it"" will come. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence the contradiction.

114	Ah-hah-hah he is true he is he is not really ah-hah-hah	i don't agree with you, he's too consistent.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship between them is: contradiction.

The premise seems to be expressing doubt or uncertainty about someone's truthfulness, while the hypothesis is stating disagreement with that uncertainty, implying that the person is consistent and therefore trustworthy. These two statements are opposing each other, hence the contradiction."
115	Ah-hah-hah he is true he is he is not really ah-hah-hah	You're probably right about the consistency.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship between them is NEUTRAL. The premise seems to be expressing a mix of agreement and disagreement, but it's not clear what ""he is true"" or ""he is not really"" refers to, and how it relates to the hypothesis about consistency. The hypothesis appears to be making a statement about the speaker's opinion, but it's not directly connected to the premise.

In Zulu, I would say ""Kungenzeka ukuthi kube ngokuqondile"" which means ""It's not clear what's going on here!"""
116	Ah-hah-hah he is true he is he is not really ah-hah-hah	you are right about that, because he is not consistent.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that the relationship between them is... entailment!

The premise seems to be expressing a mix of agreement and disagreement, but ultimately, it implies that the person in question is not consistent. The hypothesis then builds upon this idea, stating that the inconsistency is the reason why the speaker is right. Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis.

Ngiyabonga (thank you) for the question!"

222	Pride has wrapped up her cover.	a huge smile spread across her face.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!) In Zulu, I'd say ""Ngicela ukwethula"" (Let me explain).

In this case, the premise and hypothesis seem unrelated. The premise talks about ""Pride"" wrapping up a cover, while the hypothesis describes a huge smile on her face. There's no logical connection between the two statements.

So, my answer would be: neutral."
223	Pride has wrapped up her cover.	she felt a tingling in her stomach.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

The answer is: neutral."
224	Pride has wrapped up her cover.	her face was wrinkled.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I'd say the relationship between them is NEUTRAL. The premise talks about Pride wrapping up her cover, which doesn't provide any information about her face being wrinkled or not. There's no direct connection between the two statements.

In isiZulu, I'd say: ""Kunezinto ezahlukene phakathi kwesimo nesithiyo."" (There's no connection between the premise and the hypothesis.)"

The correct answer is: contradiction.

In the premise, it is stated that ""her own expression changed"" to something other than what it was initially, implying a negative or concerned reaction. However, the hypothesis suggests that ""her face brightened"", which is the opposite of what the premise describes. Therefore, the premise contradicts the hypothesis."
227	she was looking at him with the light in her eyes, but when she saw his face swallowed up in sadness and saw the deep fury that had scarred his face, her own expression changed.	She didn't know if he was angry with her.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

In the premise, it is stated that he entered the courtyard through the main entrance, but in the hypothesis, it is stated that the main gates were locked, and he jumped over the wall. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence the contradiction."

The answer is: contradiction."
230	he walked slowly along the corner of the fortified wall and entered the courtyard through the main entrance.	the entrances to the courtyard were large.	entailment	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

235	how could i be loyal to them? it was negotiable.	the moment i see them, i put them under control.	contradiction	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say that the relationship between them is: **contradiction**.

The premise implies a sense of uncertainty or questioning about being loyal, whereas the hypothesis suggests a sense of control and dominance. These two ideas seem to be opposing each other.

In isiZulu, I would say: ""Kungani ukuthi kubonakala ukuthi kukhona ukwequla phakathi kwalezi zinto ezimbili."" (It seems that there is a contradiction between these two things.)"
236	how could i be loyal to them? it was negotiable.	i would never forgive myself if they were late.	neutral	"Sawubona! (Hello!)

After analyzing the premise and hypothesis, I would say the relationship between them is NEUTRAL. The premise talks about loyalty and negotiability, while the hypothesis discusses forgiveness and lateness. They seem to be unrelated topics, and one does not logically follow from or contradict the other.
