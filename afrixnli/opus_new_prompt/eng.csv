Cardiovascular conditioning: Perform rhythmic, continuous movements that elevate your heart rate and breathing. This can include dancing, jumping jacks, or jogging in place.\n\n3.

Cool-down: Gradually decrease the intensity of your movements to help your heart rate return to normal and prevent dizziness or fainting.\n\n5.
