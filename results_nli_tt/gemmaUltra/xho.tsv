The answer is: exact entailment. 

Explanation: The premise states that there is a molecular trace that the biosphere continues to build on the surviving regimes by spreading out a set of lines. This implies that the biosphere is undergoing a change, as it is building on surviving regimes and spreading out lines. Therefore, the hypothesis that the biosphere is undergoing dramatic change is an exact entailment of the premise.<eos>"
