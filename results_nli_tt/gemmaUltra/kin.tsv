<|assistant|>
The given premise ""They told me, uh, that they're going to call the guy we graduated from to meet me"" does not directly mention anything about a young man being called to meet the speaker. Therefore, it cannot be considered an exact entailment of the hypothesis ""I was told that a young man would be called to meet me"". 

On the other hand, the premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis either, as it only mentions calling a specific person to meet the speaker. 

So, the answer is neutral.<eos>"

Labels only. Please identify whether the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis in the following premise and hypothesis. The answer should be exact entailment, contradiction , or  neutral . 
PREMISE: Yes, people who may have been employed for any length of time or whose qualifications may have been taken into account when making a decision
HYPOTHESIS: Yes, people with the ability to make decisions are never compromised
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
Contradiction. 

Explanation: The premise suggests that people who may have been employed or whose qualifications have been taken into account are the ones who make decisions. However, the hypothesis suggests that people with the ability to make decisions are never compromised. This means that there is a contradiction between the two statements because the premise suggests that the decision-makers are a specific group of people, while the hypothesis suggests that all people with the ability to make decisions are not compromised.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: The garage was close to my house and I was afraid to go outside.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
Answer: Entailment

Explanation: The premise suggests that there has been a shooting outside, which may make the speaker afraid to go outside. The hypothesis directly follows from this premise, as it states that the garage is close to the speaker's house and they are afraid to go outside, which is consistent with the information in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis entails the premise.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: There was a shooting near my house, it's really not safe in this neighborhood
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The premise mentions a shooting ""almost three quarters of it from our home,"" which suggests that the shooting is far away and not directly affecting the speaker's home. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that there was a shooting ""near my house,"" which implies that the speaker's home is directly affected. 

Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
Contradiction. 

The premise states that the country was conceived in liberty and self-determination and dedicated itself to the idea that all men are created equal. This implies that everyone is equal and there is no hierarchy or superiority based on race, gender, or any other factors. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that some people are superior to others, which directly contradicts the idea of equality that is stated in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.<eos>"

PREMISE: He showed that any high level of thinking, first manifested in general communication, between the child and his representatives when performing joint actions.
HYPOTHESIS: Sharing routine activities sometimes helps in sharing a higher level of thinking
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The answer is neutral. 

Explanation: 
The premise and hypothesis do not provide enough information to determine whether the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis. The premise only mentions the manifestation of high level thinking in communication during joint actions, while the hypothesis suggests that sharing routine activities can help in sharing a higher level of thinking. These two statements do not directly relate to each other, and therefore, we cannot determine the relationship between them.<eos>"

The premise states that a travel check is performed after the hotel and rate matching. The hypothesis states that the speaker would like to pay for the hotel. Since the speaker has already had their hotel and rate matched, it is necessary to perform a travel check. Therefore, the premise logically leads to the hypothesis, making it an exact entailment.<eos>"

ENTAILMENT. 

Explanation: The premise suggests that parenting can have an impact on athletic performance, but it does not affect a person's overall personality. The hypothesis suggests that runners are born with potential. There is no direct relationship between a person's personality and their athletic ability. Therefore, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but instead provides additional information about the factors that affect athletic performance.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: A prestigious university does not have the funding to maintain a prestigious ranking.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it requires human interpretation of the given text. However, I can provide some possible interpretations.

If we assume that the premise and hypothesis are both true, then there is a contradiction between the two. The premise states that a prestigious university (Oxford) has announced that it is discontinuing a series, while the hypothesis suggests that a prestigious university (also Oxford) does not have the funding to maintain a prestigious ranking. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so there is a contradiction.

However, if we take the statement in the hypothesis to be about a different university than the one mentioned in the premise, then the two statements would be neutral with respect to each other. There would be no logical connection between them.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on how we interpret the two statements and whether we assume they are referring to the same entity (i.e. the same university).<eos>"
