Entailment. 

Explanation: The premise states that Khallad gave the second version, which means that the three of them broke up together in Karachi. The hypothesis states that Khallad had a 50% chance that the three of them would meet in Karachi in November. Since the premise provides evidence that the three of them were in Karachi together, it supports the hypothesis that Khallad had a 50% chance of them meeting in Karachi in November. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
The hypothesis does not directly state that Mihar received a visa because he was not seen as a danger, but it implies it. Therefore, the hypothesis can be seen as an explanation for the premise. The premise provides no direct evidence for the hypothesis, but it is not entirely contradictory either. 

So, the answer is neutral.<eos>"

The answer is exact entailment. The premise states that members of the association include those who donate $1,000 or more to the law school, which is a requirement for being a member. The hypothesis suggests asking the association for financial support, which is something that members of the association would be willing and able to do since they have already demonstrated a commitment to the law school through their donations. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the association would be willing and able to provide financial support for the school.<eos>"

Contradiction. 

Explanation:

However, the hypothesis states that ""it is estimated that one in five children will die,"" which means that not all children will survive. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.<eos>"
