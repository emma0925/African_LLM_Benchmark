PREMISE: 00 has helped us provide care, encouragement, and entertainment to nearly 400 children in the city of Indianapolis.
HYPOTHESIS: We've been able to help more Indianapolis kids.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The answer is neutral because the premise does not directly mention the number of children helped in Indianapolis, and the hypothesis does not conflict with the premise. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between the two statements.<eos>"

ENTAILMENT. 

Explanation: The premise suggests that the nursing school needs donations to provide quality education. The hypothesis presents a situation where the speaker is being asked to donate $100 to the School of Nursing or lose their scholarship. Since the speaker is being asked to donate to the same institution mentioned in the premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: more than half of the participants will increase their reporting of having a riot resolution strategy.

<|assistant|>
The answer is exact entailment. 

Explanation: 
The premise states that 80% of participants will increase their reporting of having strategies for dealing with riots. This means that at least 80% of participants will have a strategy for dealing with riots. The hypothesis states that more than half of the participants will increase their reporting of having a riot resolution strategy. Since at least 80% of participants will have a strategy for dealing with riots, it follows that more than half of the participants will have a strategy for dealing with riots. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.<eos>"

Entailment. 

Explanation: The premise suggests that the British people were honoured by the way they spoke, which implies that they had a positive attitude towards their language and culture. The hypothesis states that Britain was a world power in trade, which is consistent with this positive attitude and suggests that the country's economic success may have been partly due to its cultural strengths. Therefore, the premise supports the hypothesis and can be considered an entailment.<eos>"
