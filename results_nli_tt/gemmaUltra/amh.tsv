ENTAILMENT. 

Explanation: 
The premise states that the doors were locked when we entered.

ENTAILMENT. 

Explanation: The premise states that two concepts that appear frequently in the papers may be useful to inform future research. The hypothesis states that the papers could change the future of research. If two concepts that appear frequently in the papers are useful for future research, it logically follows that the papers could change the future of research. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.<eos>"

PREMISE: Lines with boxes show the combined security level of all mailings, and lines with diamonds show the strategic losses (if negative) of outsourcing.
HYPOTHESIS: The lines indicate the level of security in all mailings
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The premise provides information about the combined security level of all mailings and the strategic losses of outsourcing, while the hypothesis states that the lines indicate the level of security in all mailings. 

Based on this information, we can say that the hypothesis is a weaker statement than the premise, as it only refers to the lines indicating the level of security, while the premise also mentions the actual security level of all mailings. 

Therefore, we can say that the hypothesis is a special case of the premise, and the premise entails the hypothesis. 

So, the answer is ""entailment"".<eos>"

PREMISE: This letter will be delivered only if each person donates $18
HYPOTHESIS: We'll give you a gift if you donate $18
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The answer is exact entailment. 

Explanation: 
The premise states a condition for the letter to be delivered, which is that each person donates $18. This means that if each person donates $18, the letter will be delivered. 
The hypothesis states that we'll give a gift if you donate $18. This means that if you donate $18, you'll receive a gift. 
Since the premise and hypothesis are related to the same amount of donation ($18), it can be inferred that if the condition in the premise is met (each person donates $18), then the hypothesis (receiving a gift) will also be true. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.<eos>"

This premise and hypothesis are neutral as the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.

These two statements are independent of each other and do not necessarily contradict or entail each other.<eos>"
