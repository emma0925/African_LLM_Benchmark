ENTAILMENT. 

Explanation: 
The premise suggests that there was a lot of research done to make something fun. The hypothesis suggests that the speaker is surprised that something was able to be pulled off despite some obstacle. Since the premise does not provide any context about what the fun activity might be, it cannot be said that it entails or contradicts the hypothesis. However, if we assume that the fun activity is something that requires research to be successful, then the premise can be seen as supporting the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is ENTAILMENT.<eos>"

In African languages, it is common to use proverbs and idioms to express deeper meanings in a sentence. However, in this case, the premise and hypothesis do not seem to be related to any specific African language or culture. Therefore, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer without more context. It is also unclear what the exact meaning of the sentence ""I couldn't forgive myself, so I locked them up"" is in this context. 

Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis. It is also possible that there is no logical relationship between the two sentences, making the answer neutral.<eos>"

Entailment. 

Explanation: The premise suggests that if a person had a certain edition of a book, they might be more likely to buy another edition that is shorter and cheaper. This does not directly contradict the hypothesis that the book is more complicated than it appears, but it does suggest that the person might not be interested in a more complicated book. Therefore, the premise supports the hypothesis to some extent, which is entailment.<eos>"
