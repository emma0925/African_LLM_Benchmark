Contradiction. 

Explanation: The premise states that many are attributed to the fact that the biological mother is a drug addict, and the hypothesis states that the mother doesn't use any prescription medication or drugs. These two statements cannot both be true, as drug addiction typically involves the use of prescription medication or drugs. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: The Nazi regime put an end to it.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>
<|assistant|>
The answer is exact entailment. 

Explanation: The premise states that the high quality of Germany's postwar constitutional order was the greatest casualty of the Nazi regime. The hypothesis suggests that the Nazi regime put an end to it. Since the premise implies that the quality of the constitutional order was affected by the Nazi regime, it follows logically that the hypothesis is also true - the Nazi regime did put an end to it. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.<eos>"

HYPOTHESIS: I tell you that I was informed of everything.

<|assistant|>
The given premise ""I assure you, sir, that I had full knowledge of all"" and hypothesis ""I tell you that I was informed of everything"" are not logically equivalent. Therefore, they are not an exact entailment or contradiction of each other. 

However, the hypothesis ""I tell you that I was informed of everything"" can be inferred from the premise ""I assure you, sir, that I had full knowledge of all"" since it is a weaker claim. Thus, the relationship between the two statements is a partial entailment.

Therefore, the answer is not exact entailment or contradiction, but rather neutral.<eos>"

<|assistant|>
The premise suggests that the text contains only words known to occur in the twentieth century, while the hypothesis claims that the text contains words that appeared in the twentieth century but omits words that appeared earlier. 

The two statements are not contradictory because the hypothesis does not explicitly deny the possibility of words appearing earlier. However, the hypothesis does not fully support the premise, as it suggests that the text may not include all words that appeared in the early 20th century. 

Therefore, the answer is neutral.<eos>"
