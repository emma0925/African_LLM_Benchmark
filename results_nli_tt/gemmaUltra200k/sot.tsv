<|assistant|>
There is no clear answer to this question as the premise and hypothesis do not provide a clear logical relationship. The premise seems to suggest that there is a molecular signal that the biosphere is pushing to prepare within the survival for the gene pool, which could be interpreted as a form of adaptation or evolution. However, it is unclear how this relates to the hypothesis that the biosphere is changing dramatically. The question is asking for the relationship between the two to be identified as entailment, contradiction, or neutral, but there is no clear indication of what the relationship is. Therefore, the answer is inconclusive.<eos>"

The premise does not directly contradict or support the hypothesis, and thus is neither entailment nor neutral.

HYPOTHESIS: By the 1870' s all the laws had collapsed and the country was in turmoil.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?<eos>

Thus, there is a contradiction between the two statements.<eos>"

Contradiction. The premise states that the writer wrote to them consensually, which implies that there was some sort of agreement or mutual understanding. However, the hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting that the writer wrote to them as soon as they saw them, which implies that there was no agreement or mutual understanding. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis cannot both be true and there is a contradiction.<eos>"
