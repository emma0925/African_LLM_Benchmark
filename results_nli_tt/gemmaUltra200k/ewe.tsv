Enactment. The premise states that the speaker is an envoy of the King and a noble relative of Sunderland, while the hypothesis contradicts this by suggesting that the King sent the speaker to the land of surgeons a week ago.

Entitlement, as the statement in the premise contradicts the hypothesis in the given context.

The premise states that there is a need for translation for customers who speak languages other than English. This means that people who speak languages other than English may have difficulty understanding the information provided to them. Therefore, the ability to understand and communicate with these customers through translation is important. 

The hypothesis suggests that the characters can be written in Chinese or Russian.
