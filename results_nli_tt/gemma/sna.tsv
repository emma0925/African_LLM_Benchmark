Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

**Answer:** Entailment

**Explanation:**
The premise states that the individual has experience using controls for air traffic control, implying that they have some level of expertise in controlling technical systems. The hypothesis suggests that the individual does not enjoy being the only one responsible for observing the mechanics of other space probes, which implies a preference for collaboration or shared responsibility.
