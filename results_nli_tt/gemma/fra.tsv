**Answer:** Entailment

**Explanation:**
The premise states that gun control goes through both hands, which implies that it is possible to use a gun with one hand. The hypothesis states that half of all firearm failures result from one-handed use. Since the premise implies that it is possible to use a gun with one hand, it entails the hypothesis that half of all firearm failures result from one-handed use."

**Answer:** Entailment

**Explanation:**
The premise directly supports the hypothesis. The premise states that the source of something is unknown, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the source is unknown but the speed of the something is known."

Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

**Answer:** Entailment

**Explanation:**
The premise specifically states that something is coming from somewhere, while the hypothesis states that it is coming fast but the source is unknown. Since the premise already establishes that the something is coming from a specific location, it necessarily entails the hypothesis that it is coming fast."
