Explanation: The premise and hypothesis are neutral towards each other as they do not directly address each other. The premise talks about a specific scenario where all genes change to a red-orange color when a gene is duplicated, while the hypothesis talks about a general scenario where only half of the genes can change to red-orange when they are multiplied.

HYPOTHESIS: He observes how high the sea temperature rises during the day.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?
Answer: Neutral
Explanation: The premise provides information about the range of sea temperature, but it does not provide any information about whether the temperature rises or falls during the day. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically mentions ""how high the sea temperature rises during the day"", which implies that the temperature is rising, which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are neutral with respect to each other."
