PREMISE: After two years of investigation, the FBI was unable to locate the co-worker or determine his true identity
HYPOTHESIS: The FBI found out who he was and the police arrested him
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Contradiction

Explanation: The premise states that the FBI was unable to locate the co-worker or determine his true identity after two years of investigation. This implies that the FBI did not find out who he was. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the FBI found out who he was and the police arrested him, which implies that the FBI did find out who he was. Therefore, the premise contradicts the hypothesis."

Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral. The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis, but it does not entail it either. The premise simply states a fact about the last normal communication on the flight, while the hypothesis states a broader statement about the availability of communication with the flight. The two statements are unrelated, so there is no entailment or contradiction."

HYPOTHESIS: capabilities are imperfect, but the key is WHAT is done to improve or reform it
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral? 

Answer: Entailment. The premise suggests that if the search had been carried out in depth, it would have revealed the whereabouts of the three fugitives, which implies that the capabilities of the search are sufficient to locate the fugitives. This entails the hypothesis that capabilities are imperfect, as the premise suggests that the search was not able to locate the fugitives despite being carried out in depth."

PREMISE: For example, max, all the genes turned purple.
HYPOTHESIS: maximun, only the middle of the genes can turn purple
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral. The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis, but it also does not entail it. The premise simply provides an example of genes turning purple, while the hypothesis specifies that only the middle of the genes can turn purple. There is no logical connection between the two statements, so they are neutral with respect to each other."

PREMISE: For example, max, all the genes turned purple.
HYPOTHESIS: PE can be genetically engineered to change color
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral.

Explanation: The premise does not directly imply or contradict the hypothesis. The premise provides an extreme and unrealistic scenario where all genes are turned purple, which has no logical connection to the hypothesis about genetic engineering. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral."
107	For example, max, all the genes turned purple.	From time to time, the genes will NOT turn blue	entailment	"Labels only.

PREMISE: For example, max, all the genes turned purple.
HYPOTHESIS: From time to time, the genes will NOT turn blue
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral

Explanation: The premise and hypothesis do not logically entail or contradict each other. The premise states that all the genes turned purple, while the hypothesis states that the genes will not turn blue from time to time. These two statements do not necessarily imply a logical contradiction or entailment, and therefore the answer is neutral."
