PREMISE: I want to say that there was no danger of entering with the bomb because it cannot explode, despite the fact that it would fall to the ground.
HYPOTHESIS: The bomb had no chance of exploding.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral.

Explanation: The premise and hypothesis are neutral because they both refer to the same fact - that the bomb cannot explode. The premise states that there was no danger of entering with the bomb because it cannot explode, while the hypothesis states that the bomb had no chance of exploding. Both statements are true, and there is no logical contradiction between them. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral."

HYPOTHESIS: There was a high risk of an explosion.

These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as it is possible that the bomb cannot explode due to some other reason than the fact that it would fall to the ground. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are neutral."

PREMISE: [This country has been] born in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
HYPOTHESIS: Others believed that all people are equal.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer:

A) Entailment

Explanation:
The premise states that Bernstein explains in the introduction that the new theory will revolutionize the field of psychology.

Since the premise mentions the revolutionizing of the field of psychology, which is also mentioned in the hypothesis, it entails the hypothesis.
