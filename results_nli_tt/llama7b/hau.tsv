HYPOTHESIS: The girl who would help me was five miles away.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral

EXPLANATION: The premise and hypothesis are similar in that they both describe a division of labor based on gender roles. The premise mentions sorting people based on who will contribute to the farm and who will support the household, which is similar to the hypothesis' description of a disagreement over who will be the farmer and who will be the householder.

Answer: Entailment

Explanation: The premise ""And is it made the way I try to make it?"" directly entails the hypothesis ""I'm trying to do this, you see."" as the premise provides additional information that supports the hypothesis. The use of ""and"" implies a continuation of the same idea, making it clear that the speaker is still talking about the same thing as in the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis."

Answer: Neutral.

Explanation: The premise provides additional reasons why the file might be missing, but it does not directly entail or contradict the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the file was deleted from the computer's memory, and the premise provides additional possibilities for why the file might be missing, such as short-circuits, deletion of the original file on the hard drive, and inability to access the necessary documents. These additional possibilities do not directly contradict the hypothesis, but they do provide alternative explanations for why the file might be missing. Therefore, the answer is neutral."

HYPOTHESIS: The agency did not issue a certificate of completion of the SBA.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

The hypothesis states that the officers ran to wherever they were needed, and the premise provides examples of specific locations where they were assigned, such as upstairs, floors, public buildings, shopping malls, and PATH stations. The premise does not provide any information about whether the officers actually ran to these locations or not, so it is neutral with respect to the hypothesis."

Explanation: The premise does not entail or contradict the hypothesis.

Explanation: The premise states that all discarded protocols in 2003 will have the same protocol number, 315.

Since the premise specifically mentions protocols related to international terrorists, it entails the hypothesis by implying that all things related to terrorism have been moved back one step."

Answer: Neutral

Explanation: The premise does not directly entail or contradict the hypothesis. The premise mentions that Suskirbshan could not afford to maintain the program for the entire season, but it does not directly address the responsibility for the cost of its management. The hypothesis only mentions that if ticket sales are sold for the entire event, then the cost of managing the event will be responsible, but it does not specify who will be responsible for that cost. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are neutral to each other."

HYPOTHESIS: Ticket sales and subscriptions will take care of 70 percent of the running costs for our entire season.
Is it  entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

Answer: Neutral. The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis, but it does provide additional information that may affect the accuracy of the hypothesis. If tickets sales are not sufficient to cover 70% of the running costs, then the hypothesis may not be true. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact impact of the premise on the hypothesis."
