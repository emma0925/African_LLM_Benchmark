"J'étais l'un des, euh, Juste utiliser le régulateur PONA, le test des chambres d'altitude","Je suis euh! le chef de l'armée, je démissionne, comme le dit Rick",contradiction,"The premise discusses someone talking about using a specific device, the PONA regulator, during altitude chamber tests. The hypothesis, on the other hand, involves someone claiming to be the head of the army and resigning, as stated by someone named Rick.

These two statements do not logically connect in any way that would suggest one necessarily follows from or contradicts the other. The premise does not provide any information about military roles or resignations.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"J'étais l'un des, euh, Juste utiliser le régulateur PONA, le test des chambres d'altitude","Il dit que c'était juste un pinzoli à lire dans ses yeux, puis il dit que c'est Joe",entailment,"The premise discusses someone being involved in using a PONA regulator and conducting altitude chamber tests. The hypothesis, on the other hand, mentions someone interpreting it as merely reading in someone's eyes and then mentions a person named Joe.

The premise and hypothesis discuss different subjects and contexts. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the use of a PONA regulator and altitude chamber tests, and interpreting something as reading in someone's eyes or mentioning someone named Joe.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"J'étais l'un des, euh, Juste utiliser le régulateur PONA, le test des chambres d'altitude","comme il a dit marte sur le porche, il a jeté un pinceau dans les yeux",neutral,"The premise and the hypothesis do not share any direct information or context that would allow one to logically deduce the truth of the hypothesis from the premise. The premise talks about using a specific regulator and testing altitude chambers, while the hypothesis discusses an unrelated action involving throwing a brush into the eyes.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"Il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air",ils ont fait de l'exercice avec des costumes de pression et c'est arrivé quand je suis parti,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise repeatedly states ""there is air,"" but it does not provide any information about people exercising with pressure suits or any events occurring after someone left. Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
"Il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air",Il faut trois mois pour terminer l'apprentissage du costume spatial.,entailment,"Neutral. The premise, which repeatedly states ""there is air,"" does not provide any information related to the duration required to complete space suit training mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis."
"Il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air, il y a de l'air",J'ai dit à Tina que je voulais juste voir les totaux pour résoudre ce problème,neutral,"Neutral. The premise, which repeatedly states ""there is air,"" does not provide any information about a conversation or a statement made to Tina regarding seeing totals to solve a problem. Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
"croyez-moi, monsieur, ils m'ont tout dit à ce sujet",On t'a dit Que je sais tout Ce que c'est,contradiction,"The premise translates to ""believe me, sir, they told me everything about it"" and the hypothesis translates to ""They told you that I know everything about it.""

The premise states that the speaker was told everything about a certain subject by others. The hypothesis suggests that the speaker was informed that a third party (implied to be the person being addressed in the premise) knows everything about the subject.

Given that the premise does not specify who knows everything about the subject, only that the speaker was told everything, it does not necessarily imply that the person being addressed knows everything about the subject. Therefore, the hypothesis introduces information that is not directly supported by the premise.

Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"croyez-moi, monsieur, ils m'ont tout dit à ce sujet",C'est la mort de cet inspecteur qu'on m'a dit,entailment,"The premise is ""croyez-moi, monsieur, ils m'ont tout dit à ce sujet"" which translates to ""believe me, sir, they told me everything about it."" The hypothesis is ""C'est la mort de cet inspecteur qu'on m'a dit"" which translates to ""It's the death of that inspector that I was told about.""

The premise indicates that the speaker was told everything about a certain subject, but does not specify what the subject was. The hypothesis specifies that the subject was the death of an inspector.

Since the premise does not confirm or deny that the subject was the death of an inspector, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis directly, as it is unclear what the specific subject discussed was."
"croyez-moi, monsieur, ils m'ont tout dit à ce sujet",Il y a beaucoup de petits noms Qui m'ont été cachés,neutral,"The premise translates to ""Believe me, sir, they told me everything about it."" The hypothesis translates to ""There are many pet names that have been hidden from me.""

The premise suggests that the speaker was informed about everything regarding a specific subject, while the hypothesis suggests that there were many details (specifically, ""pet names"") that were hidden from the speaker.

Given that the premise states that everything was revealed, and the hypothesis claims that certain details were hidden, these statements contradict each other.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction."
Le bruit tourmentait le capitaine Blood Dans ses rêves anxieux,Le capitaine Blood était capable de se souvenir de choses qui lui rendaient malheureux de ne pas pouvoir le découper.,contradiction,"The premise states that ""The noise tormented Captain Blood in his anxious dreams,"" while the hypothesis suggests that ""Captain Blood was able to remember things that made him unhappy because he couldn't cut them up.""

The premise focuses on the noise tormenting Captain Blood during his dreams, indicating he was disturbed by something in his sleep. The hypothesis, however, introduces a new idea about Captain Blood remembering specific things that made him unhappy, linked to an inability to ""cut them up,"" which is not mentioned or implied in the premise.

Since the hypothesis introduces information not contained or implied in the premise, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Le bruit tourmentait le capitaine Blood Dans ses rêves anxieux,la pensée du capitaine Blood a été coupée par le bruit,neutral,"The premise states that ""The noise tormented Captain Blood in his anxious dreams,"" while the hypothesis suggests that ""Captain Blood's thoughts were interrupted by the noise."" 

The premise implies that the noise affected Captain Blood negatively during his sleep, specifically within his dreams. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the noise had an impact on his thoughts, suggesting an interruption.

Since the premise focuses on the emotional effect (torment) during sleep (dreams) and the hypothesis on a cognitive interruption (thoughts being cut off), the connection between the emotional torment in dreams and the cognitive interruption in waking thoughts isn't directly established. It's possible to be tormented by noise in one's dreams without it necessarily interrupting one's waking thoughts.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not necessarily entail nor directly contradict the hypothesis."
Le bruit tourmentait le capitaine Blood Dans ses rêves anxieux,Le bruit du chiot a fait sortir le capitaine De ses pensées,entailment,"The premise states that the noise tormented Captain Blood in his anxious dreams, while the hypothesis suggests that the noise from the puppy caused Captain Blood to come out of his thoughts. These statements focus on different effects of noise on Captain Blood (tormenting in dreams vs. interrupting thoughts) and do not specify that the noise in both cases was the same or had the same context (dreams vs. waking thoughts).

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or contradict the hypothesis directly."
tu m'as bien aidé quand j'étais en Barbade,"Là, à moins de trois coudées, c'était le sol, une paroi inégale de vert vif remplissait l'horizon.",neutral,"The premise translates to ""you helped me a lot when I was in Barbados"" and the hypothesis translates to ""There, less than three cubits away, was the ground, an uneven wall of bright green filled the horizon.""

The premise discusses someone being helped in Barbados, while the hypothesis describes a visual scene with a green wall. There is no direct connection or contradiction between being helped in Barbados and observing a green wall.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
tu m'as bien aidé quand j'étais en Barbade,Un paysage luxueux,entailment,"Neutral. The premise ""tu m'as bien aidé quand j'étais en Barbade"" translates to ""you helped me a lot when I was in Barbados"" and does not provide information about the luxuriousness of the landscape. The hypothesis ""Un paysage luxueux"" translates to ""A luxurious landscape."" There is no direct connection or contradiction between being helped in Barbados and the nature of the landscape."
tu m'as bien aidé quand j'étais en Barbade,"Le roi a envoyé des gens, je suis l'un d'entre eux",contradiction,"The premise states ""you helped me well when I was in Barbados"" and the hypothesis states ""The king sent people, I am one of them."" There is no direct connection or contradiction between being helped in Barbados and being sent by a king. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
le roi m'a envoyé ici Il y a une semaine de Naya,je ne reçois pas d'ordre de la part du chef,contradiction,"The premise states: ""le roi m'a envoyé ici Il y a une semaine de Naya"" which translates to ""the king sent me here a week ago from Naya.""

The hypothesis states: ""je ne reçois pas d'ordre de la part du chef"" which translates to ""I do not receive orders from the boss.""

The premise and hypothesis are discussing different sources of authority (the king vs. the boss). The premise indicates that the speaker receives orders from the king, but it does not specify whether or not the speaker also receives orders from another authority figure referred to as ""the boss.""

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral** because the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis."
le roi m'a envoyé ici Il y a une semaine de Naya,"Il fallait te le donner, ou je l'ai accepté, dit-il",neutral,"The premise states: ""The king sent me here a week ago from Naya.""
The hypothesis states: ""It had to be given to you, or I accepted it, he said.""

These statements do not logically connect in a way that one can be directly inferred from the other. The premise is about being sent by the king from a specific place, while the hypothesis discusses something being given or accepted.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
le roi m'a envoyé ici Il y a une semaine de Naya,Je n'ai pas pensé qu'il devait te donner quelque chose,entailment,"The premise states: ""The king sent me here a week ago from Naya.""
The hypothesis states: ""I did not think he had to give you anything.""

The premise discusses the action of being sent by the king from a place called Naya. The hypothesis discusses the speaker's thoughts about whether the king had to give something to someone.

These statements are related to actions and thoughts about different aspects of an interaction involving the king. The premise does not provide any information about the king needing to give something, nor about the thoughts of the speaker regarding any gifts.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis."
il t'était redevable pour l'aide que tu lui as apportée quand il demandait de l'argent à la prison,blood n'a pas eu de rêve de Tina dans son lit vivant,neutral,"The premise discusses someone being indebted for help provided when they were asking for money in prison. The hypothesis talks about someone not having a dream of Tina alive in their bed.

These two statements are about completely different subjects and scenarios. The premise is about a debt of gratitude related to financial assistance in prison, while the hypothesis is about a specific dream content involving a person named Tina.

Since the premise and the hypothesis do not share any direct or indirect relationship or dependency based on the information provided, the relationship between them is neutral."
il t'était redevable pour l'aide que tu lui as apportée quand il demandait de l'argent à la prison,Blood mâchait la nourriture qu'il mangeait pendant qu'il dormait dans son lit,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses someone being indebted for help provided when asking for money in prison, while the hypothesis talks about someone chewing food while sleeping in bed. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements."
il t'était redevable pour l'aide que tu lui as apportée quand il demandait de l'argent à la prison,Blood a commencé à se souvenir de la dernière fois qu'il a vu sa mère.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses someone being indebted for help provided when they were asking for money in prison, while the hypothesis talks about someone named Blood remembering the last time he saw his mother. There is no direct connection or conflict between the two statements, as they address completely different situations and subjects."
"oui, alors, je vais vous le dire","très bien, je vais vous le dire",entailment,"The premise ""oui, alors, je vais vous le dire"" translates to ""yes, so, I am going to tell you."" The hypothesis ""très bien, je vais vous le dire"" translates to ""very well, I am going to tell you."" Both statements express the intent of the speaker to tell something, but they start with different introductory phrases (""yes, so"" vs. ""very well""). 

These differences in the introductory phrases do not change the main action of telling something. Therefore, the core meaning remains the same, but the slight difference in the introductory context does not strictly entail one from the other.

This scenario is best classified as **neutral** because while the main action is the same, the introductory context differs slightly, and one does not strictly entail or contradict the other."
"oui, alors, je vais vous le dire",Je suis resté silencieux,neutral,"This is a contradiction.

Premise: ""oui, alors, je vais vous le dire"" translates to ""yes, so, I am going to tell you.""
Hypothesis: ""Je suis resté silencieux"" translates to ""I remained silent.""

The premise indicates that the speaker is about to speak or disclose something, while the hypothesis states that the speaker remained silent. These two statements cannot both be true in the same context, as speaking contradicts remaining silent."
"oui, alors, je vais vous le dire",c'est juste que tu as promis de ne le dire à personne MAIS je vais te le dire,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise ""oui, alors, je vais vous le dire"" translates to ""yes, so, I am going to tell you"" in English, indicating that the speaker is about to reveal some information. The hypothesis ""c'est juste que tu as promis de ne le dire à personne MAIS je vais te le dire"" translates to ""it's just that you promised not to tell anyone BUT I am going to tell you,"" which introduces additional context about a promise not to disclose the information, but the decision to reveal it regardless.

The premise does not provide information about any promise or the exclusivity of the information being shared, nor does it contradict the idea that such a promise might exist. Therefore, the relationship is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Mais comment?,Quelqu'un demande où il doit aller,contradiction,"The premise ""Mais comment?"" translates to ""But how?"" in English, indicating a question about the method or manner of doing something. The hypothesis ""Quelqu'un demande où il doit aller"" translates to ""Someone is asking where they should go,"" which is a question about direction or location.

Since the premise is questioning the method or manner and the hypothesis is about asking for a location, they address different aspects. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Mais comment?,l'interrogateur soit seul ou avec quelqu'un Ne lui parlez pas,entailment,"The premise ""Mais comment?"" translates to ""But how?"" in English, which expresses a question or confusion about how something is to be done or is possible. 

The hypothesis ""l'interrogateur soit seul ou avec quelqu'un Ne lui parlez pas"" translates to ""whether the interrogator is alone or with someone, do not speak to him."" This is a directive or instruction regarding not speaking to the interrogator regardless of their company status.

Given the premise is a general expression of inquiry or confusion and the hypothesis is a specific instruction about not speaking to someone, there is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the two statements. 

The relationship is therefore **neutral**; the premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Mais comment?,Quelqu'un qui va poser une question va vite Il doit savoir immédiatement où aller,neutral,"The premise ""Mais comment?"" translates to ""But how?"" in English, which indicates a question or a request for clarification or explanation about something.

The hypothesis ""Quelqu'un qui va poser une question va vite Il doit savoir immédiatement où aller"" translates to ""Someone who is going to ask a question moves quickly. He must immediately know where to go."" This suggests that a person asking a question is in a hurry and knows exactly where they need to go to get their answer.

The premise expresses uncertainty or a need for explanation, while the hypothesis suggests a scenario where the person asking a question is not only certain but also in a hurry and knows exactly what they need. 

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the conditions described in the hypothesis. The premise simply shows a request for explanation, without any implications about the speed or knowledge of the person asking."
je ne donne pas de commission à Pete,donner une commission à un roi qui n'a pas d'éthique,contradiction,"The premise ""je ne donne pas de commission à Pete"" translates to ""I do not give a commission to Pete."" The hypothesis ""donner une commission à un roi qui n'a pas d'éthique"" translates to ""give a commission to a king who has no ethics.""

The premise specifically states that no commission is given to Pete, but it does not specify anything about giving a commission to anyone else, including a king with no ethics. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor directly contradicts the hypothesis, as they involve different subjects and contexts.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
je ne donne pas de commission à Pete,ont beaucoup réfléchi à la commission du roi,entailment,"The premise ""je ne donne pas de commission à Pete"" translates to ""I do not give a commission to Pete."" The hypothesis ""ont beaucoup réfléchi à la commission du roi"" translates to ""have thought a lot about the king's commission.""

The premise discusses not giving a commission to Pete, while the hypothesis discusses thinking about the king's commission. These two statements are about different subjects and different commissions. Therefore, there is no direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.

The answer is neutral."
je ne donne pas de commission à Pete,j'ai fondé un mandat pour donner une commission au roi Je vais trouver un moyen de le faire,neutral,"The premise states ""I do not give a commission to Pete"" while the hypothesis states ""I have established a mandate to give a commission to the king I will find a way to do it."" The premise and hypothesis discuss giving commissions to different individuals (Pete and the king). Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis since they involve different subjects and actions. The relationship is **neutral**."
il s'est rendu compte qu'il aurait dû faire demi-tour rapidement,Il s'est rendu compte qu'il n'avait pas passé la journée entière,entailment,"The premise states that ""he realized that he should have turned back quickly,"" which suggests a moment of realization about a specific action related to changing his direction or course of action.

The hypothesis states that ""he realized that he had not spent the entire day,"" which refers to a realization about the duration of time spent on activities during the day.

These two statements do not directly relate to each other in terms of the specific content of the realization. The premise is about the action of turning back, while the hypothesis is about the duration of time spent. Therefore, there is no direct entailment or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
il s'est rendu compte qu'il aurait dû faire demi-tour rapidement,a compris qu'il lui fallait agir avec urgence.,contradiction,Entailment.
il s'est rendu compte qu'il aurait dû faire demi-tour rapidement,s'il était resté quelque part On l'aurait vu,neutral,"The premise states that ""he realized that he should have turned back quickly,"" which implies a sense of regret or missed opportunity in not reversing his course sooner. The hypothesis suggests that ""if he had stayed somewhere, he would have been seen."" 

The premise does not provide information about whether he stayed somewhere or continued moving, only that he realized he should have turned back. The hypothesis introduces a new scenario about being seen if he had stayed.

Since the premise does not confirm or deny whether he stayed or was seen, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. There is no direct entailment or contradiction based on the information provided."
il n'a pas aimé comme il a tué tant de gens il y a trois ans,Il a parlé avec joie de ses aventures ET de sa personnalité,neutral,Contradiction
il n'a pas aimé comme il a tué tant de gens il y a trois ans,Il parlait avec tristesse,entailment,"Neutral. The premise states that he did not like how he killed so many people three years ago, but this does not necessarily imply that he spoke with sadness. The emotional state or manner of speaking is not specified in the premise, so it does not entail or contradict the hypothesis."
il n'a pas aimé comme il a tué tant de gens il y a trois ans,Dans l'espoir qu'il rencontre tes désirs,contradiction,"The premise translates to ""He did not like how he killed so many people three years ago,"" and the hypothesis translates to ""Hoping that he meets your desires.""

The premise discusses a past event involving disapproval of actions (killing many people), while the hypothesis expresses a future-oriented hope regarding someone meeting desires. There is no direct logical connection or opposition between disliking past violent actions and hoping for future fulfillment of desires.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis.",j'ai lu des articles sur votre peuple et votre culture,entailment,"The premise ""Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis"" translates to ""There are enemies, but there are enemies,"" which discusses the existence of enemies. The hypothesis ""j'ai lu des articles sur votre peuple et votre culture"" translates to ""I have read articles about your people and your culture,"" which talks about reading articles on a group's people and culture.

The premise and the hypothesis discuss completely different subjects. The premise is about the existence of enemies, while the hypothesis is about reading articles on culture and people. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the existence of enemies and reading about a culture or people.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis.",Il n'y a pas beaucoup de Penza parmi nous,neutral,"The premise ""Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis"" translates to ""There are enemies, but there are enemies,"" which essentially repeats the same information about the presence of enemies. 

The hypothesis ""Il n'y a pas beaucoup de Penza parmi nous"" translates to ""There are not many Penza among us,"" which discusses the presence of a specific group or type of people, referred to as ""Penza.""

Since the premise discusses the presence of enemies without specifying who these enemies are or mentioning the group ""Penza,"" and the hypothesis specifically talks about the quantity of ""Penza"" among a group, the premise neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis.",Il a fermé le visage Il a fermé les yeux Il a tourné le visage,contradiction,"The premise ""Il y a des ennemis, mais il y a des ennemis"" translates to ""There are enemies, but there are enemies,"" which essentially repeats the same information about the presence of enemies.

The hypothesis ""Il a fermé le visage Il a fermé les yeux Il a tourné le visage"" translates to ""He closed his face He closed his eyes He turned his face."" This describes actions of closing eyes and turning the face, possibly in response to a situation.

Given that the premise discusses the presence of enemies but does not specify any reactions or actions taken in response to these enemies, and the hypothesis describes specific actions that are not mentioned or implied in the premise, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the actions described in the hypothesis."
Un sourire sur son visage,il a ressenti une forte douleur à l'estomac,entailment,"The premise ""Un sourire sur son visage"" translates to ""A smile on his face"" in English. The hypothesis ""il a ressenti une forte douleur à l'estomac"" translates to ""he felt a strong pain in his stomach.""

The premise describes someone smiling, which generally conveys happiness, contentment, or a lack of distress. The hypothesis, however, suggests that the person is experiencing strong stomach pain, which typically would not result in smiling, but rather expressions of discomfort or pain.

Given that the premise and the hypothesis convey opposite emotional or physical states, this is a contradiction."
Un sourire sur son visage,se couvre la tête / se couvre le visage,neutral,"The premise ""Un sourire sur son visage"" translates to ""A smile on his/her face"" in English. The hypothesis ""se couvre la tête / se couvre le visage"" translates to ""covers his/her head / covers his/her face.""

The premise describes someone smiling, showing their face. The hypothesis suggests covering the head or face, which would hide the face or part of it.

Since the premise involves showing the face (smiling), and the hypothesis involves covering the face, these two statements do not logically support each other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction."
Un sourire sur son visage,"Il regarda en arrière, mais quand il vit son visage triste, et qu'il s'enfonçait dans sa poitrine, son visage changea.",contradiction,Contradiction.
Son visage a changé depuis que je l'ai vu,Son visage s'est éclairé Quand il a vu son visage s'effondrer,neutral,"The premise states ""His face has changed since I saw him,"" which indicates a general change in appearance or expression but does not specify the nature of the change.

The hypothesis states ""His face brightened when he saw his face collapse,"" which implies a specific sequence and type of emotional reactions: first brightening (typically a sign of happiness or excitement) and then collapsing (typically a sign of sadness or disappointment).

Since the premise does not specify the type of change (whether it was a brightening, collapsing, or something else entirely), it does not specifically support or directly contradict the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Son visage a changé depuis que je l'ai vu,Il ne savait pas s'il avait son Kanda,entailment,"The premise ""Son visage a changé depuis que je l'ai vu"" translates to ""His face has changed since I saw him."" The hypothesis ""Il ne savait pas s'il avait son Kanda"" translates to ""He did not know if he had his Kanda.""

The premise discusses a change in someone's face since the last time they were seen, while the hypothesis deals with the person's knowledge about possessing something called ""Kanda,"" which seems unrelated to the change in appearance.

Since the premise and the hypothesis discuss different aspects (physical appearance vs. knowledge or possession of an item), they do not logically support or contradict each other directly.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Son visage a changé depuis que je l'ai vu,"en marchant lentement, il a tourné le mur de l'escalier et a franchi les portes de la cour",contradiction,"The premise states: ""His face has changed since I last saw him.""
The hypothesis states: ""Walking slowly, he turned the corner of the stairwell and passed through the courtyard doors.""

The premise discusses a change in someone's facial appearance since the last time they were seen, while the hypothesis describes a specific action involving movement through a location. There is no direct connection or conflict between the change in facial appearance and the action of moving through a location.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"Comme les portes étaient verrouillées, il est monté sur le mur et est descendu dans la cour.",Les grandes portes étaient le seul moyen d'entrer dans la cour,neutral,"Contradiction. 

The premise states that because the doors were locked, he climbed over the wall and descended into the courtyard. This implies that there was another way to enter the courtyard besides the doors. The hypothesis states that the large doors were the only way to enter the courtyard. Therefore, the premise contradicts the hypothesis."
"Comme les portes étaient verrouillées, il est monté sur le mur et est descendu dans la cour.",Il y avait de grandes portes qui allaient jusqu'à la cour,entailment,"Neutral.

Explanation:
The premise states that because the doors were locked, he climbed over the wall and descended into the courtyard. This indicates that the doors were locked, but it does not provide any information about the size of the doors or whether they led directly to the courtyard.

The hypothesis suggests that there were large doors leading to the courtyard. The premise does not provide any information about the size of the doors or their direct access to the courtyard, only that they were locked.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis."
"Comme les portes étaient verrouillées, il est monté sur le mur et est descendu dans la cour.",C'était un shérif qui attrapait des voleurs,contradiction,"Neutral. The premise describes someone climbing over a wall because the doors were locked, but it does not specify who this person is or their purpose. The hypothesis suggests it was a sheriff catching thieves, which is not directly supported or contradicted by the information in the premise."
Je suis l'envoyé du roi dans la région des barbares sur les bateaux du roi à Sunderland.,Plusieurs pays et autorités locales ont besoin d'audits supplémentaires,contradiction,"The premise and the hypothesis are neutral with respect to each other. The premise discusses someone being the king's envoy in a region of barbarians on the king's boats in Sunderland, while the hypothesis talks about various countries and local authorities needing additional audits. There is no direct connection or contradiction between being an envoy and the need for additional audits in various countries and local authorities."
Je suis l'envoyé du roi dans la région des barbares sur les bateaux du roi à Sunderland.,Les gouvernements locaux sont en mesure de fixer leurs propres règles,entailment,"The premise states that the speaker is the king's envoy in the barbarian region on the king's ships at Sunderland. The hypothesis discusses local governments being able to set their own rules. There is no direct connection or opposition between the premise and the hypothesis regarding the role or authority of local governments based on the information about the king's envoy. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Je suis l'envoyé du roi dans la région des barbares sur les bateaux du roi à Sunderland.,Les autorités locales n'ont aucune exigence,neutral,"The premise states that the speaker is the king's envoy in the barbarian region on the king's boats in Sunderland. The hypothesis states that local authorities have no requirements.

This relationship is neutral, as the premise does not provide any information about the requirements or lack thereof imposed by local authorities. The premise focuses on the role and location of the speaker, not on the policies or actions of local authorities."
Il existe d'autres exigences d'audit qui ont été définies par les autorités locales.,Le groupe de sécurité du prêtre s'est réuni en 8 PE 12 sessions mensuelles.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses audit requirements set by local authorities, while the hypothesis talks about a priest's security group meeting in specific sessions. There is no direct connection or conflict between the information about audit requirements and the meetings of a priest's security group."
Il existe d'autres exigences d'audit qui ont été définies par les autorités locales.,groupe de sécurité est en moyenne de 9 séances par mois,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses audit requirements set by local authorities, while the hypothesis talks about the average number of sessions held by a security group per month. These two statements are about different subjects and do not logically influence each other."
Il existe d'autres exigences d'audit qui ont été définies par les autorités locales.,", le groupe de sécurité est en session tous les jours du mois",contradiction,"Neutral. The premise discusses the existence of audit requirements set by local authorities, while the hypothesis talks about a security group being in session every day of the month. There is no direct connection or conflict between the premise and the hypothesis, as they address different subjects."
le groupe de sécurité organise plusieurs sessions par an,"Pourtant, l'ingénierie antérieure a été réalisée depuis longtemps.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""the security group organizes several sessions a year,"" which is information about the frequency of activities conducted by the security group. The hypothesis states that ""However, the previous engineering has been done a long time ago,"" which refers to the timing of some engineering work but does not directly relate to the activities of the security group mentioned in the premise. There is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the timing of previous engineering work and the frequency of sessions organized by the security group."
le groupe de sécurité organise plusieurs sessions par an,l'ingénierie est à un stade préliminaire,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the frequency of sessions organized by a security group, while the hypothesis talks about the stage of engineering.

Les dossiers peuvent être écrits dans d'autres langues,d'autres possibilités exo salame ou PE,neutral,"The premise states that ""Les dossiers peuvent être écrits dans d'autres langues,"" which translates to ""The files can be written in other languages."" The hypothesis ""d'autres possibilités exo salame ou PE"" seems to be a nonsensical or unrelated phrase and does not clearly relate to the premise about files being written in other languages.

Given the lack of a clear and logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, the relationship is **neutral**. The hypothesis neither logically follows from nor contradicts the premise."
Les dossiers peuvent être écrits dans d'autres langues,la plupart de nos talents sont à l'œuvre,entailment,"The premise ""Les dossiers peuvent être écrits dans d'autres langues"" translates to ""The files can be written in other languages."" The hypothesis ""la plupart de nos talents sont à l'œuvre"" translates to ""most of our talents are at work.""

It is not a project for the future."" The premise discusses the capability of writing files in different languages, whereas the hypothesis talks about the lack of something and the absence of future plans.

These statements are discussing different subjects and do not logically connect in a way that one confirms or denies the other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer,les supprimeurs de fichiers informatiques d'IBM,neutral,"The premise ""Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer"" translates to ""If we have something to prepare."" The hypothesis ""les supprimeurs de fichiers informatiques d'IBM"" translates to ""the IBM computer file deleters.""

The premise talks about preparing something, which is a general statement and does not specify what is being prepared. The hypothesis specifically mentions IBM computer file deleters, which is a very specific tool or function related to technology and file management.

Since the premise does not provide any information about technology, computers, or file management, it neither directly supports nor directly contradicts the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer,les suppresseurs de fichiers Dora,contradiction,"The premise ""Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer"" translates to ""If we have something to prepare"" in English. The hypothesis ""les suppresseurs de fichiers Dora"" translates to ""the Dora file deleters.""

The premise discusses having something to prepare, which is a general statement and does not specify what needs to be prepared. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically mentions ""Dora file deleters,"" which relates to deleting files and is unrelated to the general idea of preparing something.

Since the premise and the hypothesis discuss unrelated topics, the relationship between them is neutral. They neither support nor contradict each other directly. Therefore, the answer is neutral."
Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer,Ils ont sauvegardé tous les fichiers de Dora,entailment,"The premise ""Si nous avons quelque chose à préparer"" translates to ""If we have something to prepare"" and the hypothesis ""Ils ont sauvegardé tous les fichiers de Dora"" translates to ""They have saved all of Dora's files.""

Le représentant va voir les gens PONNE une heure,a été visité par un représentant,neutral,"The premise states that ""Le représentant va voir les gens PONNE une heure,"" which seems to imply that the representative is going to see people for an hour. The hypothesis states that someone ""a été visité par un représentant"" (was visited by a representative).

Entailment would mean that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, if the representative is going to see people, it logically follows that those people were visited by the representative.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is entailment."
Le représentant va voir les gens PONNE une heure,Ne restez pas en visite,contradiction,"The premise states that ""Le représentant va voir les gens PONNE une heure,"" which seems to imply that the representative is going to visit people for a certain duration (one hour). However, there is a typographical error or unclear word ""PONNE"" which might be intended to be ""pour une"" (for one).

The hypothesis states, ""Ne restez pas en visite,"" which translates to ""Do not stay visiting.""

Given the premise suggests a visit is planned and the hypothesis advises against staying for a visit, the relationship between the two is a contradiction. The premise indicates a visit will occur, while the hypothesis advises against such a visit.

Answer: Contradiction."
Le représentant va voir les gens PONNE une heure,Votre choix de protéger ou non est influencé par la communauté,entailment,"The premise and the hypothesis seem unrelated based on the information provided.

The hypothesis states that ""the rich are able to keep a part of their fortune,"" which implies that wealthy individuals have the ability to retain some of their wealth.

The premise does not directly address the ability of the rich to keep their wealth, but the implication of an abundant economy and wealth could suggest that retaining wealth is feasible. However, since the premise does not explicitly confirm the ability of the rich to keep their wealth, nor does it deny it, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not one of direct entailment or contradiction.

Therefore, the relationship is **neutral**. The premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
La richesse et l'économie sont trop nombreuses,nous savions que le salaire serait long,neutral,"The premise ""La richesse et l'économie sont trop nombreuses"" translates to ""The wealth and the economy are too numerous.""

The hypothesis suggests that Khallad said the three managed to escape together.

This scenario is neutral: the premise does not provide information about the individuals escaping or succeeding in any particular action, only that they flew together. The hypothesis introduces the concept of them escaping together, which is not addressed in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
"Khallad a donné une deuxième version, qui veut dire que les trois ont volé ensemble à Karachi.",Khallad a déclaré qu'il avait 50% de chances que les trois se rencontrent à Karachi en novembre.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that Khallad gave a second version, indicating that the three individuals flew together to Karachi. The hypothesis, on the other hand, discusses Khallad declaring a 50% probability of the three meeting in Karachi in November. The premise focuses on an event where the three individuals definitely traveled together, while the hypothesis discusses the probability of a meeting, not necessarily involving travel together or confirming it happened. These statements do not directly contradict each other but neither do they confirm one another. Therefore, the relationship is neutral."

The hypothesis suggests that ""Mihdhar does not need to stay to obtain a visa, so he does not need to stay to come to us.""

The premise provides specific information about the timing of Mihdhar obtaining a visa relative to a meeting. The hypothesis discusses the necessity (or lack thereof) for Mihdhar to stay in order to obtain a visa and to come to ""us"" (presumably the speaker's location).

The hypothesis implies that obtaining the visa did not require Mihdhar to stay in a particular location, which is not directly addressed or contradicted by the premise. The premise only states when the visa was obtained, not the conditions or requirements for obtaining it, such as whether he needed to stay in a particular place.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Mihdhar a obtenu un nouveau visa américain deux jours après la réunion CIA-FBI à New York.,Mihar a obtenu un visa parce qu'il n'y avait aucun danger sur son corps,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""Mihdhar obtained a new U.S. visa two days after the CIA-FBI meeting in New York,"" but it does not provide any information regarding the reasons for the visa issuance or whether it was because there was no danger associated with him. The hypothesis suggests a reason for obtaining the visa (""because there was no danger on his body""), which is not supported or refuted by the information in the premise.

"Au cours des deux dernières années d'enquête, le FBI n'a pas été en mesure de localiser le collègue ou de déterminer son identité réelle.",Le FBI n'a toujours pas retrouvé cet homme depuis qu'il a débarqué en Floride en 2001.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Explanation:
- The premise states that during the last two years of investigation, the FBI has not been able to locate the colleague or determine his real identity.
- The hypothesis states that the FBI has not found the man since he arrived in Florida in 2001.

The premise focuses on a specific two-year period without specifying the exact years or the overall duration since the man's arrival in Florida. The hypothesis extends the timeframe to since 2001, which could potentially include many more years beyond the two years mentioned in the premise. Since the premise does not provide information about the FBI's efforts or success outside of the two-year investigation period, it neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis that the FBI has not found the man since 2001. Hence, the relationship is neutral."
"Au cours des deux dernières années d'enquête, le FBI n'a pas été en mesure de localiser le collègue ou de déterminer son identité réelle.",Le FBI reste à savoir qui il était,contradiction,"Entailment. The premise states that the FBI has not been able to locate the colleague or determine their real identity, which directly supports the hypothesis that the FBI still does not know who the colleague was."

The hypothesis suggests that the German government could have been in pain without a quick and thorough investigation.

The premise and hypothesis do not directly address the same specific details beyond the notion of an investigation. The premise focuses on the potential outcome of a thorough investigation (finding the fugitives), while the hypothesis discusses a general condition of the government potentially suffering due to the lack of a quick and thorough investigation. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation between the specific outcome of revealing the fugitives' location and the government's condition due to the investigation's nature.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
une recherche plus approfondie aurait révélé l'emplacement des trois fugitifs,enquête peut être effectuée facilement par l'administration,neutral,"The premise states that ""a more thorough investigation would have revealed the location of the three fugitives,"" which implies that the investigation was not conducted or not thorough enough to reveal the location of the fugitives.

The hypothesis states that ""an investigation can be easily carried out by the administration,"" which suggests that conducting investigations is generally easy for the administration.

These two statements do not directly contradict each other, as the premise does not claim that investigations are difficult or cannot be easily done by the administration. Nor does the premise directly support the hypothesis that investigations are easy. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
une recherche plus approfondie aurait révélé l'emplacement des trois fugitifs,"les capacités ne sont pas parfaites, mais il est possible de les encourager et de les réformer",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses a deeper investigation revealing the location of three fugitives, while the hypothesis speaks about the imperfection of abilities but the possibility of encouraging and reforming them.

"SI C'était le cas, étaient- ils trop nombreux?",La biosphère est en pleine mutation,contradiction,"The premise ""SI C'était le cas, étaient- ils trop nombreux?"" translates to ""If that were the case, were they too many?"" This sentence is asking whether, given a certain situation, there were too many of something (unspecified).

The hypothesis ""La biosphère est en pleine mutation"" translates to ""The biosphere is undergoing significant changes.""

These two statements are discussing completely different subjects. The premise is questioning the number of entities in a specific, undefined scenario, while the hypothesis is making a statement about the state of the biosphere. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the number of entities and the state of the biosphere changing.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"SI C'était le cas, étaient- ils trop nombreux?",La biosphère change selon la température,neutral,"The premise ""SI C'était le cas, étaient- ils trop nombreux?"" translates to ""If that was the case, were they too many?"" This statement seems to be questioning the number of something given a certain condition.

The hypothesis ""La biosphère change selon la température"" translates to ""The biosphere changes according to the temperature."" This statement discusses a general fact about how the biosphere reacts to changes in temperature.

There is no direct connection or relation between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise discusses a conditional scenario about quantity, while the hypothesis states a fact about environmental change due to temperature.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"SI C'était le cas, étaient- ils trop nombreux?",La biosphère est inchangée,entailment,"The premise ""Si c'était le cas, étaient-ils trop nombreux?"" translates to ""If that was the case, were there too many?"" This statement poses a question about whether there were too many of something given a certain condition.

The hypothesis ""La biosphère est inchangée"" translates to ""The biosphere is unchanged.""

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise asks about the quantity of something under a specific condition, while the hypothesis states that the biosphere remains unchanged. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the number of entities being discussed in the premise and the state of the biosphere in the hypothesis. Thus, the correct answer is neutral."
"Dans ce cas, le cristal normal peut encoder moins de messages.",Les cristaux réguliers sont un support unique pour le stockage de données à haute densité.,contradiction,"The premise states that ""in this case, the normal crystal can encode fewer messages,"" which implies limitations in the data storage capacity of the normal crystal. The hypothesis claims that ""regular crystals are a unique medium for high-density data storage,"" suggesting that regular crystals have a high data storage capacity.

Since the premise suggests a limitation in the storage capacity of normal crystals, and the hypothesis suggests a high storage capacity in regular crystals, there is a potential discrepancy depending on whether ""normal crystals"" and ""regular crystals"" refer to the same type of crystals. If they are the same, this could be a contradiction. If they refer to different types of crystals, the relationship might be neutral.

Without additional context to confirm whether ""normal crystals"" and ""regular crystals"" are the same, the safest classification is **neutral**."
"Dans ce cas, le cristal normal peut encoder moins de messages.",Les cristaux réguliers sont inutiles,neutral,"The premise states that ""normal crystal can encode fewer messages,"" which implies a limitation in the capacity of normal crystals for encoding messages. The hypothesis states that ""regular crystals are useless.""

This relationship is neutral. The premise discussing the encoding capacity of normal crystals does not directly imply that these crystals are entirely useless; they might still have some utility despite their limited capacity. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports (entails) nor directly opposes (contradicts) the hypothesis that regular crystals are useless."
"Dans ce cas, le cristal normal peut encoder moins de messages.",Il y a des cristaux d'une certaine façon qui sont utiles pour encoder les prêtres géographiques.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. 

The premise states that ""in this case, the normal crystal can encode fewer messages,"" which suggests a limitation in the capacity of a normal crystal for encoding messages. The hypothesis mentions that ""there are crystals in a certain way that are useful for encoding geographical priests,"" which introduces a different context or type of crystal that may have a specific use. 

Since the premise discusses the encoding capacity of normal crystals in general and the hypothesis discusses a specific use of potentially different crystals, there is no direct contradiction or confirmation between the two statements. Therefore, the relationship is neutral."
"Par conséquent, les parents ne devraient pas enseigner aux enfants de moins d'un an comment conduire une voiture",certains pensaient que tous les hommes étaient égaux,entailment,"The premise discusses the idea that parents should not teach children under one year old how to drive a car.

"Par conséquent, les parents ne devraient pas enseigner aux enfants de moins d'un an comment conduire une voiture",Dois-je le féliciter davantage?,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the inappropriateness of teaching infants under one year old how to drive a car, while the hypothesis is a question about whether to praise someone more. There is no logical connection or contradiction between the two statements."
Je suis presque sûre qu'il faut que je joue ses échecs,Je me demande si c'est nécessaire Je suis très reconnaissante de ma part,entailment,"The premise translates to ""I am almost sure that I have to play his chess,"" while the hypothesis translates to ""I wonder if it's necessary. I am very grateful on my part.""

The premise discusses a sense of obligation or necessity related to playing chess, while the hypothesis expresses uncertainty about the necessity of an unspecified action and mentions a feeling of gratitude.

Since the premise and hypothesis discuss different aspects and the hypothesis introduces uncertainty and gratitude which are not present in the premise, the relationship between them is neither one of direct entailment nor contradiction.

Therefore, the relationship is **neutral**."
Je suis presque sûre qu'il faut que je joue ses échecs,Est-ce que je dois le féliciter beaucoup pour son beau piano?,neutral,"The premise translates to ""I am almost sure that I have to play his chess,"" while the hypothesis translates to ""Should I congratulate him a lot for his beautiful piano?"" 

The premise discusses the speaker's necessity to play someone's chess, while the hypothesis is about congratulating someone for their piano. The two statements are about different subjects and activities, thus they do not logically relate to one another in a way that one confirms or denies the other.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Je suis presque sûre qu'il faut que je joue ses échecs,la théorie du réseau de rotation peut être construite à différentes dimensions,contradiction,"The premise and the hypothesis are unrelated. The premise discusses the speaker's belief about needing to play chess, while the hypothesis talks about a theoretical concept in a possibly scientific or mathematical context. There is no logical connection between the two statements.

Answer: Neutral"
D'autres dimensions peuvent être créées en développant la théorie des réseaux de spin.,Les réseaux de spin sont très dépendants des technologies de stockage de données.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the potential of creating other dimensions by developing spin network theory, while the hypothesis talks about spin networks being highly dependent on data storage technologies. There is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the creation of dimensions and the dependency on data storage technologies in the context of spin networks."
D'autres dimensions peuvent être créées en développant la théorie des réseaux de spin.,les réseaux de spin ne peuvent pas être comparés à différentes dimensions,entailment,"The premise states that other dimensions can be created by developing spin network theory. The hypothesis claims that spin networks cannot be compared to different dimensions. 

The premise suggests a possibility of creating or relating to other dimensions through the development of spin network theory, while the hypothesis states that spin networks cannot be compared to different dimensions, implying they are unrelated or incomparable.

This presents a contradiction because if other dimensions can be created or are related through spin networks (as per the premise), then spin networks are inherently comparable or related to different dimensions, contrary to what the hypothesis suggests.

Answer: Contradiction."
D'autres dimensions peuvent être créées en développant la théorie des réseaux de spin.,"(Tout le temps), non, je ne veux pas mourir",neutral,"The premise discusses the possibility of creating other dimensions by developing spin network theory. The hypothesis states a personal sentiment about not wanting to die. These two statements are unrelated to each other; the content of one does not logically affect or relate to the content of the other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
je ne veux pas mourir,Cela n'a pas d'importance si vous êtes mort,entailment,"The premise ""je ne veux pas mourir"" translates to ""I do not want to die"" in English. The hypothesis ""Cela n'a pas d'importance si vous êtes mort"" translates to ""It does not matter if you are dead.""

The premise expresses a desire not to die, while the hypothesis suggests indifference to the state of being dead. These statements address different aspects: one is about a personal desire regarding life, and the other is about the significance of being dead.

Since the premise and hypothesis do not directly oppose or logically necessitate each other, the relationship is **neutral**."
je ne veux pas mourir,d'être furieux si vous mouriez,neutral,"The premise ""je ne veux pas mourir"" translates to ""I do not want to die"" in English. The hypothesis ""d'être furieux si vous mouriez"" translates to ""to be furious if you died.""

The premise expresses a personal desire not to die, while the hypothesis discusses a hypothetical reaction (being furious) if the person addressed (vous) were to die. The premise and hypothesis are discussing different subjects and emotional reactions related to death.

Since the premise is about the speaker's own desire not to die and the hypothesis is about someone else's potential emotional reaction to another's death, they do not logically entail or contradict each other directly.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
je ne veux pas mourir,Il a été libéré publiquement le 19 mars 1875 à San Jose en Californie.,contradiction,"The premise ""je ne veux pas mourir"" translates to ""I do not want to die"" in English. The hypothesis ""Il a été libéré publiquement le 19 mars 1875 à San Jose en Californie"" translates to ""He was publicly released on March 19, 1875, in San Jose, California.""

These two statements are unrelated. The premise is about not wanting to die, and the hypothesis is about someone being released in California on a specific date. There is no logical connection between not wanting to die and someone being released.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"En Californie, la peur des gens est apparue en 1875",sa condamnation a été levée et il a été ridiculisé,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

"En Californie, la peur des gens est apparue en 1875","Sous le régime tyrannique, le fleuve vert illumine le perchoir",entailment,"The premise and the hypothesis are unrelated in content. The premise discusses the emergence of fear among people in California in 1875, while the hypothesis talks about a ""green river"" illuminating a ""perch"" under a tyrannical regime. There is no logical connection or direct opposition between the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship is neutral."
la rivière était d'un bleu profond et lisse comme du verre,La rivière était pleine de petits poissons Qui commençaient à monter dans le bateau,entailment,"The premise states that ""the river was deep blue and smooth as glass,"" while the hypothesis claims that ""the river was full of small fish starting to get into the boat."" The premise describes the appearance of the river, focusing on its color and smooth surface, but does not provide any information about the presence of fish or any activity in the river. Therefore, the hypothesis introduces new information that is not addressed in the premise.

Answer: Neutral"

la rivière était d'un bleu profond et lisse comme du verre,Une série de lois complètement nouvelles a été mise en place au cours des années 1860.,contradiction,"The premise describes a river being deep blue and smooth like glass, which is a visual and physical description of a scene. The hypothesis discusses the implementation of completely new laws in the 1860s, which is a historical and legislative statement.

Since the premise and the hypothesis are about completely different subjects (a description of a river's appearance versus legislative changes in a specific decade), there is no logical connection between them. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"Dans les années 1870, une série de lois entraînant l'UE Le pays était dans la tourmente.",les années 1860 ont été une époque de récolte,contradiction,"The premise discusses events in the 1870s involving laws that led to turmoil in the country. The hypothesis talks about the 1860s being a time of harvest. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, as they refer to different decades and unrelated events. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"Dans les années 1870, une série de lois entraînant l'UE Le pays était dans la tourmente.",Une série de nouvelles lois visaient à étendre le droit du travail.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that in the 1870s, a series of laws led to turmoil in the country, but it does not specify what the laws were about. The hypothesis suggests that the laws were aimed at expanding labor rights, but this is not mentioned or implied in the premise. Therefore, there is no direct link or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis based on the information provided."

The premise discusses a series of laws in the 1870s that led to turmoil in the country, while the hypothesis talks about the appearance of superior ideas in conversations among people and cultural interactions.

The premise discusses children's inability to share their deepest concerns, while the hypothesis talks about the popularity of fishing in many cultures. These two statements are unrelated to each other."
Les enfants sont incapables de partager leurs soucis les plus profonds,participer à des activités communes en même temps afin de partager des formes supérieures d'idées,entailment,"The premise states that ""children are unable to share their deepest concerns,"" while the hypothesis discusses ""participating in common activities at the same time in order to share higher forms of ideas."" 

The premise focuses on the inability of children to share their deep emotional or personal concerns. The hypothesis, however, is about participating in activities to share ideas, which could be interpreted as sharing thoughts or concepts that may not necessarily be as deep or personal as the ""concerns"" mentioned in the premise.

Since the premise and hypothesis address different aspects of sharing (emotional/personal concerns vs. ideas/concepts), they do not directly contradict or necessarily entail one another. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Les enfants sont incapables de partager leurs soucis les plus profonds,"D'autres quartiers ont des rezasores ou PE rezasores, des camps spirituels qui dirigent l'assemblée en prières pendant les funérailles, pendant les fêtes de tous les saints car le prêtre n'est pas présent.",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

The premise states that there were no spiritual camps (""Il n'y avait pas de camps spirituels""), while the hypothesis suggests that there were other neighborhoods in spiritual camps (""d'autres quartiers étaient dans des camps spirituels""). This directly contradicts the information given in the premise."
Il n'y avait pas de communauté Il n'y avait pas de camps spirituels Il n'y avait pas de prêtres,Les camps d'autres esprits étaient aux cheveux noirs,entailment,"The premise states that there were no spiritual camps and no priests. The hypothesis discusses the hair color of individuals in other spiritual camps. Since the premise asserts that there were no spiritual camps at all, the hypothesis about the characteristics of people in these non-existent camps does not logically follow from or directly contradict the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Il n'y avait pas de communauté Il n'y avait pas de camps spirituels Il n'y avait pas de prêtres,"Dans le théâtre sociodramatique PE, il est possible de coordonner différents rôles sans discuter Les enfants découvrent des similitudes et des différences entre les besoins, les croyances et les émotions des gens.",contradiction,"Neutral.

The premise discusses the absence of a community, spiritual camps, and priests, which is primarily focused on the lack of certain social and religious structures. The hypothesis, on the other hand, talks about the dynamics within a specific type of sociodramatic play (PE), where children learn about similarities and differences among people's needs, beliefs, and emotions through role coordination without discussion.

The premise and the hypothesis address different subjects without any direct overlap or contradiction. The premise's focus on the absence of certain groups or structures does not logically influence or contradict the process of learning and interaction described in the hypothesis within a sociodramatic setting. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."

Le régime nazi a exécuté tous ceux qui en faisaient partie,Interdite par le régime nazi.,entailment,"The premise states that ""The Nazi regime executed all those who were part of it,"" while the hypothesis states that ""It was forbidden by the Nazi regime.""

This relationship is neutral. The premise discusses the actions taken by the Nazi regime against its own members, while the hypothesis refers to something being forbidden by the regime. There is no direct logical relationship or contradiction between the execution of members and the prohibition of an unspecified act or item."
Le régime nazi a exécuté tous ceux qui en faisaient partie,Sonja a commencé à imiter les crises de sa fille,neutral,This is neutral. The premise about the Nazi regime executing its members has no direct relation to the hypothesis about Sonja imitating her daughter's seizures.

These two statements are discussing different subjects: one is about the actions of the Nazi regime, and the other is about the presence of people in a crisis called Kanda, which is not related or mentioned in the premise. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."

The premise discusses a personal detail about Sonja, while the hypothesis discusses a historical or political situation involving a court's power.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Sonja a une fille,les tribunaux ont parfois utilisé ce pouvoir dans la décennie précédant le début de la guerre civile,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise ""Sonja a une fille"" (Sonja has a daughter) has no direct or indirect connection to the hypothesis about courts using their power before the civil war. Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
"Le tribunal a exercé ce pouvoir quatre fois depuis les années cinquante-cinq, ce qui a entraîné la condamnation civile.","La cour a utilisé ce pouvoir 5 millions de fois en 5 ans, ce qui a conduit à la guerre civile.",entailment,"This is a contradiction. The premise states that the court exercised its power four times since the 1950s leading to civil condemnation, whereas the hypothesis claims the court used its power 5 million times in 5 years leading to civil war.

La salle d'audience n'est pas un lieu politique à Washington,"Oui, c'est une belle Penza, il a plu ?",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the nature of a courtroom in Washington not being a political place, while the hypothesis appears to be a non-sequitur, mentioning the beauty of Penza and asking about rain, which has no logical connection to the premise. Thus, the premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."
La salle d'audience n'est pas un lieu politique à Washington,C'est une peur terrible Dans la lumière sans fin,entailment,"The premise states that ""The courtroom is not a political place in Washington,"" while the hypothesis says, ""It is a terrible fear in the endless light."" 

The premise discusses the nature of a location (a courtroom not being political), and the hypothesis discusses an emotional state or feeling in a metaphorical or abstract context. There is no direct logical connection or opposition between the nature of the courtroom and the emotional state described in the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."

The hypothesis states that they ""ont récemment terminé leur marche"" (recently finished their walk).

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
toute la vie doit être soignée avec de la dexintox PE avant de recevoir une seconde dose,comment faire de l'aérobic,neutral,"The premise discusses the need to treat all life with a specific substance before administering a second dose, while the hypothesis asks about how to perform aerobics.

The hypothesis states that the person is following aerobics because the speaker needs cardiovascular activities. 

The premise does not provide any information about the reason why the person started doing aerobics, nor does it indicate that it is because the speaker needs cardiovascular activities. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

Peux-tu m'expliquer comment tu as commencé à faire de l'aérobic ?,arrêter de parler d'aérobic,neutral,"The premise is asking for an explanation about how someone started doing aerobics.

C'est une idée stupide Qui a augmenté la race,c'est une bonne chose,contradiction,Contradiction
C'est une idée stupide Qui a augmenté la race,Ce que tu dis est une affaire de valeur,neutral,"The premise states ""C'est une idée stupide Qui a augmenté la race,"" which translates to ""It's a stupid idea that has increased the race."" The hypothesis states ""Ce que tu dis est une affaire de valeur,"" which translates to ""What you are saying is a matter of value.""

The premise criticizes an idea as ""stupid"" and notes its impact on ""increasing the race,"" which seems to imply a negative view of the idea's consequences or rationale. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the statement is a matter of value judgment, implying subjectivity in the assessment.

Given that the premise is making a specific evaluative statement about the idea, and the hypothesis suggests that such statements are subjective or value-based, the relationship between the two can be seen as neutral. The premise does not necessarily support nor directly contradict the hypothesis; it merely presents a specific judgment, while the hypothesis frames such judgments as subjective.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
C'est une idée stupide Qui a augmenté la race,c'était ce qu'ils pensaient,entailment,"The premise states ""C'est une idée stupide Qui a augmenté la race,"" which translates to ""It's a stupid idea that increased the race."" The hypothesis states ""c'était ce qu'ils pensaient,"" which translates to ""that's what they thought.""

The premise describes an idea being considered stupid and having an effect on increasing the race, while the hypothesis suggests that this was the opinion held by some people. The hypothesis does not specify what the thought was about, whether it was about the idea being stupid or about the idea increasing the race, or both.

Given this, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The hypothesis does not directly affirm or deny the premise but rather introduces a possible opinion about the premise without specifying what the opinion is directed towards."
c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire,Ne reste pas dans le vide,contradiction,"The premise ""c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire"" translates to ""that's what they tried to do"" in English. The hypothesis ""Ne reste pas dans le vide"" translates to ""Do not stay in the void"" or ""Do not remain idle.""

The premise discusses an attempt made by some people to do something, but it does not specify what that something is. The hypothesis is an imperative suggesting not to stay idle or in a void, which does not directly relate to the nature of the attempt described in the premise.

Since the premise and the hypothesis discuss different aspects without any direct overlap or contradiction in content, the relationship between them is neutral. They neither logically necessitate nor contradict each other based on the information provided."
c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire,Ils ont trompé celui qu'ils avaient promis,entailment,"The premise ""c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire"" translates to ""that's what they tried to do."" The hypothesis ""Ils ont trompé celui qu'ils avaient promis"" translates to ""They deceived the one they had promised.""

The premise does not specify what action they tried to perform, only that they attempted something. The hypothesis specifies a deceitful action towards someone they had made a promise to. Since the premise does not detail the nature of the action attempted, it does not necessarily imply deceit.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire,"au milieu des coups de feu, les coups de feu n'ont pas touché à l'aide d'une seule main",neutral,"The premise ""c'est ce qu'ils ont essayé de faire"" translates to ""that's what they tried to do."" The hypothesis ""au milieu des coups de feu, les coups de feu n'ont pas touché à l'aide d'une seule main"" translates to ""in the midst of gunfire, the gunfire did not hit with just one hand.""

The premise does not specify what was attempted, nor does it mention gunfire or any specific actions related to handling gunfire. The hypothesis introduces a specific scenario involving gunfire and the manner in which it was handled, which is not addressed in the premise.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**, as the premise neither confirms nor denies the specifics of the hypothesis."
Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine,Je ne sais rien de l'amour,entailment,"Neutral. The premise ""Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine"" (I don't have much experience in this field) does not specify which field is being discussed, and it does not necessarily imply complete ignorance. The hypothesis ""Je ne sais rien de l'amour"" (I know nothing about love) is about a specific topic (love), which may or may not be the field referred to in the premise. Therefore, there is no direct entailment or contradiction between the two statements."
Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine,je le lis depuis des années,neutral,"The premise ""Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine"" translates to ""I do not have much experience in this field."" The hypothesis ""je le lis depuis des années"" translates to ""I have been reading it for years.""

The premise discusses a lack of experience in a particular field, while the hypothesis suggests a long duration of reading something related to that field. Reading could be part of gaining experience, but stating that one has been reading for years does not necessarily imply having a lot of practical experience in that field.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise does not directly contradict or necessarily entail the hypothesis."
Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine,oui c'était une belle connaissance,contradiction,"The premise ""Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience dans ce domaine"" translates to ""I do not have much experience in this field."" The hypothesis ""oui c'était une belle connaissance"" translates to ""yes, it was a beautiful knowledge.""

The premise discusses a lack of experience in a certain field, while the hypothesis seems to reflect on a positive knowledge or learning experience. Since the premise states a lack of experience and the hypothesis implies a positive reflection on knowledge, they do not directly address the same aspect. The premise does not necessarily contradict the hypothesis, as one can have a positive learning experience even with limited overall experience. However, the premise also does not entail the hypothesis, as it does not confirm having had a positive or significant learning experience.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."

The hypothesis states that the team does not have just one name.

This premise implies that the team has had at least two names (the original name and the name ""Ko Bamba""). The hypothesis suggests that the team has more than one name. Therefore, the information in the hypothesis is supported by the premise.

Answer: Entailment."

The hypothesis states that the speaker used the ""Thésaurus standard,"" but does not clarify whether this is the same as ""thesaurus PE"" or a different one. Therefore, there is no direct entailment or contradiction, as the information is insufficient to determine whether the two thesauri are the same or different."

The hypothesis asks how it is possible for someone to do something, but it is unclear what specific action the hypothesis is referring to. It does not specify if it is about searching in the thesaurus or about not finding a definition, or something else entirely.

Since the hypothesis is vague and does not directly relate to the specific action described in the premise, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis due to the lack of specificity in the hypothesis about what action is being questioned. 

Answer: Neutral"

The hypothesis discusses how many people the speaker could not do anything about.

The premise discusses a group (""ils"" - they) potentially making a nation wicked, while the hypothesis questions the capability of a single man (""un seul homme"" - one man) to perform an unspecified action. 

Since the premise is about a group's action affecting a nation and the hypothesis is about an individual's capability to perform an action, there is no direct logical connection that one statement necessarily follows from or contradicts the other. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Comment peuvent-ils faire une nation méchante,"Encore une fois, il n'y a que dans les termes qui sont connus que l'extension du IIe siècle av.

The premise, ""Il y a tout ce qu'il faut depuis le commencement des temps"" (There has been everything needed since the beginning of time), does not specifically address the nature or variety of expectations through history. 

The hypothesis, ""Il y a beaucoup d'attentes différentes qui remontent au IIe siècle"" (There are many different expectations dating back to the second century), focuses on the diversity and historical depth of expectations, which is not directly covered by the premise. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."

The hypothesis states, ""If someone owns the 1984 edition, they might have the courage to buy a book instead of a much shorter supplement.""

The premise discusses the availability of everything needed since the beginning of time in a general sense, while the hypothesis specifically discusses someone's potential courage to buy a book over a supplement, contingent on owning a particular edition of a book.

The premise does not specifically address the availability of the 1984 edition, nor does it discuss the courage or decisions related to purchasing books or supplements. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."

These two statements do not have a direct logical connection. The premise discusses the sale status of a book, while the hypothesis talks about someone named Bernstein A explaining something in detail. There is no information provided that links the book's sale status to Bernstein A's explanation.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"Juste le matin, explique Bemstein",L'écriture est significative,entailment,"Neutral. 

The premise ""Juste le matin, explique Bernstein"" translates to ""Just in the morning, explains Bernstein,"" which provides information about when something was explained by Bernstein but does not specify what was explained. 

The hypothesis ""L'écriture est significative"" translates to ""The writing is significant,"" which is a statement about the importance or meaning of some writing.

Since the premise does not provide any information about the significance or content of the writing, it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is neutral."

The hypothesis ""Même les villageois qui les ont entendus étaient dans l'incertitude"" translates to ""Even the villagers who heard them were uncertain.""

The premise provides information about a specific time when something was explained by Bernstein, while the hypothesis discusses the reaction or state (uncertainty) of villagers who heard something.

Since the premise and hypothesis discuss different aspects (timing of an explanation by Bernstein vs. villagers' uncertainty about what they heard), they do not directly entail or contradict each other.

These two statements do not directly relate to each other in a way that allows the premise to logically entail or contradict the hypothesis.

Je me suis mis en colère et j'ai recommencé à lui parler.,Nous étions très en désaccord.,entailment,"Neutral. The premise states that the speaker became angry and started speaking to someone again, but it does not necessarily imply that there was a significant disagreement, just that there was some cause for anger. The hypothesis suggests a strong disagreement, but this is not directly confirmed or contradicted by the premise. Therefore, the relationship is neutral."
Je me suis mis en colère et j'ai recommencé à lui parler.,Ils m'ont finalement dit qu'ils m'enverraient quelqu'un pour que je puisse le rencontrer.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise describes a situation where the speaker became angry and started talking to someone again. The hypothesis discusses someone else saying they would send someone for a meeting. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the speaker's actions of getting angry and talking, and someone else's promise to send a person for a meeting. Thus, the two statements are neutral with respect to each other."
Je me suis mis en colère et j'ai recommencé à lui parler.,"Je ne peux pas le dire, même si c'est beaucoup à faire.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that the speaker became angry and started speaking to someone again, while the hypothesis discusses the speaker's inability to say something, even though it might be a lot to handle.

Je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi.,Je ne sais pas pourquoi.,contradiction,Entailment.
Je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi.,L'augmentation du nombre d'avions est décourageante.,entailment,"The premise ""Je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi"" translates to ""I don't really know why"" in English. This statement expresses a lack of knowledge or understanding about a situation or reason.

The hypothesis ""L'augmentation du nombre d'avions est décourageante"" translates to ""The increase in the number of airplanes is discouraging."" This statement expresses a sentiment or opinion about an increase in the number of airplanes.

Since the premise expresses a lack of knowledge without specifying any particular topic or context, and the hypothesis discusses a specific topic (increase in airplanes) and a sentiment about it, there is no direct connection or logical implication between the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi.,La technologie n'est ni un outil ni un outil.,neutral,"The premise ""Je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi"" translates to ""I don't really know why"" in English. This statement expresses a lack of knowledge or understanding about a reason or cause.

The hypothesis ""La technologie n'est ni un outil ni un outil"" translates to ""Technology is neither a tool nor a tool"" in English. This statement is somewhat nonsensical as it repeats itself and doesn't provide a clear or logical assertion about technology.

Given that the premise expresses a lack of knowledge and the hypothesis makes an unclear statement about technology, there is no direct logical relationship between the two. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Personne ne veut parler en Caroline du Sud.,SC a travaillé ensemble.,contradiction,"The premise ""Personne ne veut parler en Caroline du Sud"" translates to ""No one wants to talk in South Carolina."" The hypothesis ""SC a travaillé ensemble"" translates to ""SC worked together.""

The premise discusses a lack of willingness to communicate in South Carolina, while the hypothesis suggests a collaborative effort in South Carolina. The premise does not necessarily contradict the hypothesis, as people could work together without wanting to talk. Similarly, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because a lack of desire to talk does not imply that they indeed worked together.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Personne ne veut parler en Caroline du Sud.,Les démocrates et les républicains de Caroline du Sud travaillent ensemble.,entailment,"This is a case of neutral. The premise ""Personne ne veut parler en Caroline du Sud"" (No one wants to speak in South Carolina) does not provide information about the political cooperation or lack thereof between Democrats and Republicans in South Carolina. It solely comments on the willingness of people to speak, which does not necessarily relate to political collaboration. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis that Democrats and Republicans are working together in South Carolina."
Personne ne veut parler en Caroline du Sud.,Nous espérons que vous pourrez apporter votre aide à l'école de soins infirmiers.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

The hypothesis ""Je sais qu'ils ne marchent pas près de la frontière de l'État"" translates to ""I know they are not walking near the state border.""

These two statements are about completely different subjects: one is about preparing for a technological future, and the other is about people not walking near a state border. There is no logical connection or overlap between the subjects of the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
préparer notre entrée dans l'avenir technologique.,"Je veux savoir, sont-ils encore en Angleterre ?",neutral,"The premise ""préparer notre entrée dans l'avenir technologique"" translates to ""preparing our entry into the technological future."" The hypothesis ""Je veux savoir, sont-ils encore en Angleterre ?"" translates to ""I want to know, are they still in England?""

The premise discusses preparing for a technological future, while the hypothesis is asking about the current location of certain individuals in England. There is no direct connection or conflict between the premise and the hypothesis regarding the topic of technology or geographical location.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
préparer notre entrée dans l'avenir technologique.,L'orateur voulait savoir combien de fois ils étaient arrivés à la fin.,entailment,"Neutral. 

The premise ""préparer notre entrée dans l'avenir technologique"" (preparing our entry into the technological future) does not provide information about the speaker wanting to know how many times they had reached the end, as stated in the hypothesis ""L'orateur voulait savoir combien de fois ils étaient arrivés à la fin."" Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."

Une jeune fille porte un vêtement pour faire une mouche.,C'était le cas de Rockefeller.,entailment,"The premise states that a young girl is wearing an outfit to make a fly, which seems to be a metaphorical or idiomatic expression possibly implying that she is dressing to impress or stand out. The hypothesis states that this was the case for Rockefeller.

Given the information, there is no direct connection between the young girl's actions and Rockefeller. The premise and hypothesis address completely different subjects without any clear logical link or context provided that ties them together.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Une jeune fille porte un vêtement pour faire une mouche.,Rockefeller était avide.,neutral,"The premise ""Une jeune fille porte un vêtement pour faire une mouche"" (A young girl wears a garment to make a fly) and the hypothesis ""Rockefeller était avide"" (Rockefeller was greedy) have no logical or topical connection.

There is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the two statements."
Klayman est accusé de ségrégation ethnique en Californie.,Je suis parti comme ils l'avaient fait.,neutral,This is neutral. The premise about Klayman being accused of ethnic segregation in California has no direct relation to the hypothesis about someone leaving as others did. The two statements do not share enough context or content to entail or contradict each other.
Klayman est accusé de ségrégation ethnique en Californie.,"oh en tout cas, mes enfants ont vingt et un et vingt-quatre ans maintenant, donc je n'ai rien.",contradiction,"The premise states that ""Klayman is accused of ethnic segregation in California,"" while the hypothesis is a statement about the speaker's children's ages and implies the speaker has no concerns or issues. The hypothesis does not address the topic of the premise at all.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je n'en ai pas besoin parce que mes enfants ont plus de vingt ans.,Je peux les trouver parce qu'ils sont de leur âge.,entailment,"The premise translates to ""I don't need it because my children are over twenty years old."" The hypothesis translates to ""I can find them because they are of their age.""

The premise discusses not needing something because the speaker's children are over twenty years old. The hypothesis suggests that the speaker can find ""them"" (presumably referring to something unspecified) because they are of a certain age, which seems unrelated to the speaker's need.

Since the premise and hypothesis discuss different aspects (need based on children's age vs. ability to find something based on age), they do not logically entail or contradict each other directly.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is **neutral**."
Je n'en ai pas besoin parce que mes enfants ont plus de vingt ans.,"Je dois travailler, car ils ont tous deux vingt et onze ans.",neutral,"The premise states ""I don't need it because my children are over twenty years old."" The hypothesis states ""I have to work because they are both twenty-one years old.""

The premise suggests that the speaker does not need something (unspecified) because their children are older than twenty. The hypothesis states a reason for needing to work, specifically that both children are twenty-one years old.

The age of the children in both the premise and hypothesis aligns (both over twenty and specifically twenty-one), but the reasons given (not needing something vs. needing to work) do not directly contradict or necessarily follow from each other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Je n'en ai pas besoin parce que mes enfants ont plus de vingt ans.,"Les gens, en effet, peuvent être occupés à toute heure et les intentions seraient froides s'ils étaient déterminés.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Il est évident que les humains sont incapables de prendre de bonnes décisions.,Il est vrai que les gens n'ont pas toujours faim.,neutral,"The premise states that ""It is obvious that humans are incapable of making good decisions,"" while the hypothesis states that ""It is true that people are not always hungry."" These two statements address completely different aspects of human behavior and condition—decision-making capabilities versus physical states of hunger. Therefore, there is no direct logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

This is a case of neutral, as the premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Il est évident que les humains sont incapables de prendre de bonnes décisions.,"Bien sûr, ces personnes ne renoncent pas à se fixer des objectifs.",entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that it is evident that humans are incapable of making good decisions, while the hypothesis states that these people do not give up setting goals. The premise discusses the quality of decisions made by humans, whereas the hypothesis focuses on the persistence of people in setting goals, regardless of the quality of their decisions. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation between the inability to make good decisions and the act of setting goals."
Il est évident que les humains sont incapables de prendre de bonnes décisions.,"Ils ne sont pas encore arrivés, ils sont en tournée, ils sont en voyage depuis la fin des années soixante.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

These two statements are unrelated to each other. The premise talks about someone or a group being on tour since 1970, while the hypothesis discusses a scenario involving elderly care and a retirement home. There is no logical connection or overlap between the subjects of the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Ils sont en tournée depuis 1970.,La garderie est ouverte tous les jours uniquement pour les enfants de moins de cinq ans.,contradiction,"The premise ""Ils sont en tournée depuis 1970"" (They have been on tour since 1970) and the hypothesis ""La garderie est ouverte tous les jours uniquement pour les enfants de moins de cinq ans"" (The daycare is open every day only for children under five years old) have no direct relation to each other. The premise discusses a group being on tour since 1970, while the hypothesis talks about the operational details of a daycare. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Ils sont en tournée depuis 1970.,"Ils étaient autorisés à sortir deux fois par semaine, si les personnes âgées le permettaient.",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""They have been on tour since 1970,"" which provides information about their activity related to touring. The hypothesis states that ""They were allowed to go out twice a week, if the elderly allowed it,"" which discusses a different aspect related to permissions and conditions set by elderly people, not directly related to touring. There is no direct connection or conflict between the premise about touring and the hypothesis about permissions, so the answer is neutral."
"C'est un centre de soins pour personnes âgées, mais il s'agit d'une maison de retraite.",La surveillance des armes à feu est effectuée à deux mains.,neutral,"The premise discusses a care center for elderly people, specifically a retirement home. The hypothesis talks about the monitoring of firearms being done with both hands. There is no logical or thematic connection between the premise and the hypothesis.

The premise discusses the nature of a facility as a care center for the elderly and a retirement home, while the hypothesis talks about someone appearing suddenly from an unknown origin, which is unrelated to the information provided in the premise.

"C'est un centre de soins pour personnes âgées, mais il s'agit d'une maison de retraite.","Je ne sais pas d'où ça vient, mais c'est rapide.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses a care center for elderly people, which is a retirement home, while the hypothesis talks about not knowing the origin of something that is fast.

Il arrive vite mais je ne sais pas d'où il vient.,Elle vient comme du sucre et je sais exactement quand elle arrivera.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""he arrives quickly but I do not know where he is coming from,"" while the hypothesis states that ""she comes sweetly and I know exactly when she will arrive."" The subjects differ in gender and the details about the arrival and knowledge of origin do not align, thus there is no direct contradiction or entailment."
Il arrive vite mais je ne sais pas d'où il vient.,"non, je ne le connais même pas, je ne pense pas",entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states ""He arrives quickly but I don't know where he is from,"" while the hypothesis states ""No, I don't even know him, I don't think so."" The premise discusses the speed of arrival and lack of knowledge about origin, whereas the hypothesis discusses a lack of personal acquaintance and certainty. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation between the two statements; they address different aspects of knowledge about the person."
Il arrive vite mais je ne sais pas d'où il vient.,"Je pense qu'il le sait, car c'était beau.",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""He arrives quickly but I don't know where he is from,"" while the hypothesis states ""I think he knows it, because it was beautiful."" There is no direct connection or contradiction between the information about his arrival and the speaker's knowledge about the origin, and the statement about beauty and knowing something. Thus, the hypothesis neither logically follows from nor contradicts the premise."
"Non, il était effrayant.","Oui, c'était très bien.",entailment,Contradiction
"Non, il était effrayant.",Il décide d'acheter un aspirateur.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise ""Non, il était effrayant"" (No, it was scary) does not provide any information about the decision to buy a vacuum cleaner, as stated in the hypothesis ""Il décide d'acheter un aspirateur"" (He decides to buy a vacuum cleaner). Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
"Non, il était effrayant.",Il est sur le point d'acheter une serviette.,contradiction,"The premise ""Non, il était effrayant"" translates to ""No, it was scary"" in English, which describes something or someone as being scary. The hypothesis ""Il est sur le point d'acheter une serviette"" translates to ""He is about to buy a towel.""

These two statements do not have any logical connection. The premise discussing something being scary does not logically lead to, nor contradict, the action of buying a towel. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Elle voulait se laver le sang avec un linge de bain,"ce n'est pas vraiment effrayant, on vient de voir des coups de feu au lieu de trois pastes de",contradiction,"The premise states ""Elle voulait se laver le sang avec un linge de bain"" which translates to ""She wanted to wash off the blood with a bath towel."" The hypothesis ""ce n'est pas vraiment effrayant, on vient de voir des coups de feu au lieu de trois pastes de"" translates to ""it's not really scary, we just saw gunshots instead of three pastes"" (note: ""trois pastes"" seems to be a mistranslation or unclear phrase in this context).

The premise describes a specific action involving washing blood, indicating a potentially violent or disturbing scenario. The hypothesis discusses the perception of an event involving gunshots as not being scary, which seems unrelated to the action of washing blood off with a towel.

Since the premise and the hypothesis discuss different aspects and the hypothesis does not directly address the scenario of washing blood nor directly contradict or confirm it, the relationship between them is **neutral**."
Elle voulait se laver le sang avec un linge de bain,Des coups de feu ont été tirés à moins de 100 mètres de moi.,neutral,"The premise ""Elle voulait se laver le sang avec un linge de bain"" translates to ""She wanted to wash off the blood with a bath towel."" The hypothesis ""Des coups de feu ont été tirés à moins de 100 mètres de moi"" translates to ""Gunshots were fired less than 100 meters from me.""

The premise indicates that there was blood that needed to be washed off, suggesting some form of violence or injury, but it does not specify how the blood came to be there. The hypothesis suggests a specific event (gunshots fired nearby), which could potentially explain the presence of blood, but it is not directly stated that the blood came from such an event.

Given this, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not necessarily entail that gunshots were the cause of the blood, nor does it contradict the possibility; it simply does not provide enough information to directly link the blood to the gunshots described in the hypothesis."
Elle voulait se laver le sang avec un linge de bain,Des coups de feu ont été tirés près de chez moi et j'ai eu peur de m'arrêter.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise talks about someone wanting to wash off blood with a bath towel, while the hypothesis discusses hearing gunshots near someone's home and being afraid to stop. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements, as they discuss different subjects and scenarios."
"Des coups de feu ont été tirés à côté de moi, ce n'est pas bon ici.",oui c'est vraiment pas juste,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that gunshots were fired next to the speaker and it's not good there, while the hypothesis expresses a general agreement or sentiment that it's really not fair. The hypothesis does not directly address the situation of gunfire or the specific context of danger implied in the premise, but rather comments on fairness, which could be interpreted in various ways not necessarily linked to the immediate danger of the situation described in the premise. Therefore, the two statements are neutral with respect to each other."
"Des coups de feu ont été tirés à côté de moi, ce n'est pas bon ici.","Je ne suis pas tout à fait d'accord, c'est dur.",neutral,"The premise states that gunshots were fired next to the speaker and it is not good there. The hypothesis expresses a mild disagreement with the situation being described as ""hard.""

This is a case of neutral relation because the hypothesis does not directly contradict or confirm the premise. The premise focuses on the immediate danger (gunshots and negative assessment of the location), while the hypothesis seems to downplay the severity or disagree with the characterization, but does not provide a clear opposite or confirming stance regarding the specific situation of danger. Therefore, the relation is neutral."
"Des coups de feu ont été tirés à côté de moi, ce n'est pas bon ici.",Je pense que vous avez de la sagesse pour ce qui est d'être juste.,entailment,"The premise describes a situation where gunshots were fired close to the speaker, indicating danger or a negative situation. The hypothesis states that the speaker is thought to have wisdom in being fair. 

The premise and the hypothesis do not directly relate to each other. The premise focuses on a specific dangerous event, while the hypothesis comments on a personal characteristic of wisdom and fairness. There is no direct logical connection or opposition between the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Tu es trop sage pour être juste.,J'essaie de m'arrêter,neutral,"The premise ""Tu es trop sage pour être juste"" translates to ""You are too wise to be fair."" The hypothesis ""J'essaie de m'arrêter"" translates to ""I am trying to stop."" 

These statements address completely different subjects: the first evaluates a characteristic of a person (being too wise to be fair), and the second describes an individual's effort to cease an action. There is no direct logical connection or opposition between the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Tu es trop sage pour être juste.,J'ai essayé de ne pas m'arrêter.,contradiction,"The premise ""Tu es trop sage pour être juste"" translates to ""You are too wise to be fair."" The hypothesis ""J'ai essayé de ne pas m'arrêter"" translates to ""I tried not to stop.""

The premise discusses a characteristic of a person being too wise to be fair, while the hypothesis talks about someone's attempt to not stop doing something. These two statements are about different subjects and topics.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**, as the premise neither logically entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Tu es trop sage pour être juste.,J'ai fait très bien.,entailment,"The premise ""Tu es trop sage pour être juste"" translates to ""You are too wise to be fair."" The hypothesis ""J'ai fait très bien"" translates to ""I did very well."" 

The premise discusses someone's wisdom and fairness, while the hypothesis speaks about someone's performance or action. There is no direct logical connection between the assessment of wisdom and fairness and the statement about doing very well.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je vais m'arrêter et ne jamais revenir en arrière.,La loi de Pékin interdit les marchés publics dans la ville.,contradiction,"The premise ""Je vais m'arrêter et ne jamais revenir en arrière"" translates to ""I will stop and never go back."" This statement is about a personal decision or action regarding stopping and not returning.

The hypothesis ""La loi de Pékin interdit les marchés publics dans la ville"" translates to ""The law in Beijing prohibits public markets in the city."" This statement is about a legal regulation in Beijing regarding public markets.

The premise and the hypothesis are about completely different subjects: one is about a personal action and the other is about a legal regulation in a specific city. There is no logical connection between the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je vais m'arrêter et ne jamais revenir en arrière.,Le Canada était en paix.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise, which translates to ""I will stop and never go back,"" does not provide any information about the state of peace in Canada, which is what the hypothesis addresses. Therefore, the premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Je vais m'arrêter et ne jamais revenir en arrière.,Il n'y avait pas de missiles au-dessus du Canada.,neutral,"Neutral. The premise ""Je vais m'arrêter et ne jamais revenir en arrière"" (I will stop and never go back) has no direct relation to the hypothesis ""Il n'y avait pas de missiles au-dessus du Canada"" (There were no missiles above Canada). The premise discusses a personal decision to stop and not return, while the hypothesis discusses the absence of missiles over Canada. These statements do not logically influence each other."
Les skis canadiens sont extrêmement effrayants.,"Et ils continuent de l'admirer et de l'utiliser, même s'ils savent que leur beauté n'est plus à leur charge.",neutral,"The premise states that ""Canadian skis are extremely scary,"" while the hypothesis discusses people continuing to admire and use something despite knowing that its beauty is no longer their responsibility. The hypothesis does not directly address the scariness of the skis mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**, as the hypothesis neither directly contradicts nor necessarily follows from the premise."
Les skis canadiens sont extrêmement effrayants.,Ils doivent désormais partager la plage.,contradiction,"The premise states that ""Canadian skis are extremely scary,"" which discusses something about skis being frightening. The hypothesis states that ""They now have to share the beach,"" which discusses a situation involving sharing a beach, presumably referring to some entities.

There is no logical connection between the premise about skis being scary and the hypothesis about sharing the beach. The premise about skis does not provide any information about a beach or the need to share it. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Les skis canadiens sont extrêmement effrayants.,"Son édifice, situé à 27 mètres (88 pieds) sous terre, est construit en marbre et s'étend sur 1 200 mètres carrés (13 000 jours précédents).",entailment,"The premise and hypothesis you provided are about completely unrelated subjects. The premise talks about Canadian skis being extremely frightening, while the hypothesis describes a building located 27 meters underground, made of marble, and covering an area of 1,200 square meters. There is no logical connection or overlap in the content of the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Il était toujours facile de déterminer la longueur.,"Mais je n'oublierai jamais l'époque où j'étais esclave chez ton oncle, à la Barbade, et où vous m'avez soigné avec bonté.",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise, which states ""It was always easy to determine the length,"" does not logically connect or conflict with the hypothesis about remembering a time of being enslaved and treated kindly. The premise discusses a general statement about measuring length, while the hypothesis recounts a personal memory related to specific historical and emotional circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer is neutral."
Il était toujours facile de déterminer la longueur.,Tu t'es réjoui de mon affliction; tu m'as tourmenté plus que l'ordure.,contradiction,"The premise ""Il était toujours facile de déterminer la longueur"" translates to ""It was always easy to determine the length."" The hypothesis ""Tu t'es réjoui de mon affliction; tu m'as tourmenté plus que l'ordure"" translates to ""You rejoiced in my affliction; you tormented me more than dirt.""

The premise discusses the ease of measuring length, while the hypothesis discusses emotional torment and affliction. There is no logical connection between the ease of measuring length and the emotional experiences described in the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Il était toujours facile de déterminer la longueur.,Ton oncle me frappe tous les jours quand il est avec moi.,entailment,"The premise ""Il était toujours facile de déterminer la longueur"" (It was always easy to determine the length) and the hypothesis ""Ton oncle me frappe tous les jours quand il est avec moi"" (Your uncle hits me every day when he is with me) are unrelated in content. The premise discusses the ease of measuring length, while the hypothesis talks about a person being hit by another person daily.

Since the premise and the hypothesis do not share any relevant content or context that would logically connect one to the other, the relationship between them is neutral. They neither entail nor contradict each other."
L'île qu'ils ont abordée était déserte.,"Ils ne voyaient pas la terre en mille sphères, si ce n'est les océans sans fin.",entailment,"The premise states that ""The island they landed on was deserted."" The hypothesis states that ""They did not see land in a thousand spheres, except the endless oceans.""

The premise focuses on the fact that the island was deserted, implying there was land (the island) that they reached and observed. The hypothesis suggests that they did not see any land except endless oceans, which implies they did not see any islands or continents.

Given that the premise confirms the presence of an island (land) and the hypothesis implies only oceans were visible with no land, this is a contradiction. The hypothesis contradicts the premise by denying the visibility of land (islands) which the premise confirms.

Answer: Contradiction."
L'île qu'ils ont abordée était déserte.,Elle avait l'intention de vous offrir quelque chose.,contradiction,Neutral.
L'île qu'ils ont abordée était déserte.,Il fallait que je me prépare à m'approcher de la Jamaïque la nuit.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Premise: L'île qu'ils ont abordée était déserte. (The island they landed on was deserted.)
Hypothesis: Il fallait que je me prépare à m'approcher de la Jamaïque la nuit. (I had to prepare myself to approach Jamaica at night.)

The premise discusses a deserted island that ""they"" landed on, but it does not specify which island or any details related to Jamaica or the speaker's actions. The hypothesis talks about the speaker preparing to approach Jamaica at night, which is a specific action unrelated to the information given in the premise.

The premise states that members of the association are former members who give annual donations of $1000 or more to the law school. The hypothesis states that there are people in the church who have donated more than $1000 to the law school.

The premise does not specify whether the members of the association are related to the church or if they are the only ones who donate such amounts.

The hypothesis expresses a hope that each recipient of a letter will donate $18.

The hypothesis mentions that the administrator, despite having doubts, offers help, but this information does not directly relate to the information about the battle in the premise. Thus, there is no direct entailment or contradiction between the two statements."

Tout ce qui est lié au terrorisme est notre priorité.,Toutes les questions liées au terrorisme auront une signification.,contradiction,"The premise states that ""Everything related to terrorism is our priority."" The hypothesis states that ""All issues related to terrorism will have significance.""

The premise implies that terrorism-related issues are treated with high importance or priority. The hypothesis suggests that these issues will be significant, which generally aligns with the idea of being a priority, as significant issues are typically prioritized.

However, the premise does not explicitly state that all terrorism-related issues will inherently have significance; rather, it states they are prioritized, which could be for various reasons including urgency, policy, or security concerns, not necessarily because they are significant in every context.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not necessarily entail that all terrorism-related issues are significant by nature, nor does it contradict it; it merely states they are a priority."
Tout ce qui est lié au terrorisme est notre priorité.,Tous les terroristes nommés seront poursuivis et libérés.,entailment,"The premise states that everything related to terrorism is a priority. The hypothesis claims that all named terrorists will be prosecuted and released. 

The premise does not specify what actions being a priority entails, such as prosecution, release, or other forms of handling terrorism-related issues. Therefore, the hypothesis that terrorists will be both prosecuted and released does not directly follow from the premise that terrorism is a priority, nor does it directly contradict it, since the premise does not specify the nature of the actions involved.

Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Tout ce qui est lié au terrorisme est notre priorité.,L'officier qui a vu la tour sud s'effondrer a informé l'unité ESU de la tour nord.,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that ""Everything related to terrorism is our priority,"" while the hypothesis discusses an officer who witnessed the collapse of the south tower informing another unit about the north tower. The premise does not provide any information about specific events or responses to those events, and the hypothesis does not address prioritization or the broader context of terrorism directly. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Il ne restait plus personne dans la tour nord après l'effondrement de la tour sud.,La tour sud s'est effondrée 30 minutes avant que l'officier ne communique avec les unités ESU de la tour nord.,neutral,"The premise states that there was no one left in the north tower after the south tower collapsed. The hypothesis states that the south tower collapsed 30 minutes before an officer communicated with ESU units in the north tower.

The premise does not provide information about the specific timing of the collapse relative to the officer's communication with ESU units, only that the north tower was empty after the south tower collapsed. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis regarding the specific timing of events."
Il ne restait plus personne dans la tour nord après l'effondrement de la tour sud.,L'officier a été témoin de la chute de la tour sud.,entailment,"The premise states that there was no one left in the north tower after the south tower collapsed. The hypothesis suggests that an officer witnessed the collapse of the south tower. 

The premise does not provide information about the location of the officer during the collapse of the south tower or whether anyone witnessed the collapse from any location. Therefore, the hypothesis that an officer witnessed the collapse does not directly contradict nor is it necessarily entailed by the premise. 

The answer is neutral."

The premise discusses a situation where no one remained in the north tower after the collapse of the south tower, which is a specific event involving a building or structure. The hypothesis, on the other hand, talks about a molecular signal related to the biosphere being designed as a form of survival for a group of serpentine creatures, which is a biological or ecological concept.

Since the premise and the hypothesis do not share any relevant or logically connected content, the relationship between them is neutral. They neither support nor contradict each other directly. Therefore, the answer is neutral."

The hypothesis ""La température de l'eau varie entre 18 et 24 °C (64 et 75 °F)"" (The water temperature varies between 18 and 24 °C) is unrelated to the location of Milreu.

The premise states that ""All three are protected by the state,"" while the hypothesis states that ""Otto Frank is arrested the next day."" There is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the state protection of three individuals and the arrest of Otto Frank. The premise does not provide information about who the three protected individuals are or any details about Otto Frank's situation. Thus, the two statements are unrelated based on the information provided."

The premise ""Tous les trois sont protégés par l'État"" (All three are protected by the state) does not provide any information about Otto Frank or the duration of his survival. Therefore, it neither confirms nor contradicts the hypothesis that ""Otto Frank a survécu pendant plus de 25 mois"" (Otto Frank survived for more than 25 months). The two statements are unrelated."
Tous les trois sont protégés par l'État.,Otto Frank s'est caché jusqu'à ce que les nazis le trouvent.,contradiction,"The premise ""Tous les trois sont protégés par l'État"" translates to ""All three are protected by the state."" The hypothesis ""Otto Frank s'est caché jusqu'à ce que les nazis le trouvent"" translates to ""Otto Frank hid until the Nazis found him.""

The premise discusses the protection of three individuals by the state, while the hypothesis focuses on Otto Frank hiding from the Nazis until he was found. The premise does not specify who the three protected individuals are or their circumstances related to hiding or being found by Nazis.

Given this, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis since the information in the premise is about state protection of three unspecified individuals, and the hypothesis is specifically about Otto Frank's situation with the Nazis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Les humains sont capables de mémoriser des écrits malveillants.,Un texte bien écrit est plus facile à retenir qu'un texte mal écrit.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

The hypothesis ""On m'a dit qu'un homme avait été invité à me rencontrer"" translates to ""I was told that a man was invited to meet me.""

The premise involves the speaker ceasing communication with someone, while the hypothesis involves the speaker being informed about a man invited to meet them. There is no direct connection or conflict between stopping communication with someone and being informed about a meeting with another person.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
J'ai arrêté de lui parler.,cet homme est arrivé un peu en retard,contradiction,"The premise ""J'ai arrêté de lui parler"" translates to ""I stopped talking to him."" The hypothesis ""cet homme est arrivé un peu en retard"" translates to ""this man arrived a little late.""

The premise discusses stopping communication with someone, while the hypothesis is about someone arriving late. There is no direct connection or dependency between stopping talking to someone and that person's punctuality at an event or meeting.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas,je voudrais vous dire tout ce que je sais à ce sujet,contradiction,"Neutral. 

The premise, ""tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas,"" suggests not revealing everything one has to say. The hypothesis, ""je voudrais vous dire tout ce que je sais à ce sujet,"" expresses a desire to tell everything one knows about a subject. 

These statements are independent in nature; the premise advises restraint in sharing information, while the hypothesis expresses a personal intent to share fully. They do not logically entail or contradict each other directly."
tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas,"Sans parler de l'histoire de cette ville, il y a trop à dire.",entailment,"The premise ""tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas"" translates to ""do not give away everything you have to say."" This suggests withholding some information or not revealing everything.

The hypothesis ""Sans parler de l'histoire de cette ville, il y a trop à dire"" translates to ""Without even mentioning the history of this city, there is too much to say."" This implies that there is an abundance of information to discuss, even without delving into the city's history.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise advises restraint in sharing information, while the hypothesis comments on the abundance of information available. They address different aspects of communication and do not directly support or contradict each other."
tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas,je ne sais pas pourquoi c'est arrivé,neutral,"Neutral. 

The premise ""tout ce que vous avez à dire ne le donnez pas"" translates to ""do not give away everything you have to say,"" which is advice or a suggestion about withholding information. The hypothesis ""je ne sais pas pourquoi c'est arrivé"" translates to ""I don't know why it happened,"" which is an expression of lack of knowledge about an event. There is no direct logical relationship between the advice about communication in the premise and the expression of ignorance about an event in the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is neutral."
Je ne sais pas pourquoi il va à une autre école,Je ne veux pas être le seul à utiliser les régulateurs pour les tests.,neutral,"The premise translates to ""I don't know why he is going to another school"" and the hypothesis translates to ""I don't want to be the only one using the regulators for the tests."" 

These two statements do not have any direct logical connection or dependency on each other. The premise is about not knowing the reason for someone going to a different school, while the hypothesis concerns a personal desire regarding the use of regulators in tests.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je ne sais pas pourquoi il va à une autre école,les tests ont été utilisés dans une chambre miniature d'altitude,contradiction,"The premise ""Je ne sais pas pourquoi il va à une autre école"" translates to ""I don't know why he is going to another school."" The hypothesis ""les tests ont été utilisés dans une chambre miniature d'altitude"" translates to ""tests were used in a miniature altitude chamber.""

The premise is about not knowing the reason for someone going to a different school, while the hypothesis discusses the use of tests in a specific type of chamber. There is no direct connection or conflict between the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Je ne sais pas pourquoi il va à une autre école,certains d'entre nous sont devenus des régulateurs pour essayer,entailment,"The premise translates to ""I don't know why he is going to another school"" and the hypothesis translates to ""some of us have become regulators to try."" 

The premise discusses someone going to a different school and the speaker's lack of knowledge about the reason. The hypothesis talks about some people becoming regulators for an unspecified reason.

These statements are unrelated in content and context. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire,À la retraite depuis 2002,neutral,"The premise ""jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire"" translates to ""until today I can no longer do anything."" This statement suggests that the speaker is currently unable to do anything, but it does not specify the reason.

The hypothesis ""À la retraite depuis 2002"" translates to ""Retired since 2002."" This statement indicates that the speaker has been retired since 2002.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the inability to do anything is due to retirement or some other reason. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire,Rick m'a dit que j'étais à la retraite,contradiction,"The premise ""jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire"" translates to ""until today I can no longer do anything."" This suggests a situation where the speaker is unable to perform tasks or activities up to the current day.

The hypothesis ""Rick m'a dit que j'étais à la retraite"" translates to ""Rick told me that I was retired."" This implies that the speaker has been informed by Rick of their retirement status.

Determining the relationship:
- The premise indicates an inability to do anything, which could be due to various reasons including health, personal circumstances, or indeed retirement.
- The hypothesis specifically mentions retirement as the status communicated to the speaker.

Given that retirement could explain why the speaker ""can no longer do anything,"" there is a plausible connection. However, the premise does not explicitly confirm that the reason for the inability to do anything is retirement—it could be due to other factors.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise does not directly entail nor contradict the hypothesis, as the inability to do anything could stem from reasons other than retirement."
jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire,"J'ai des prévisions de flux de trésorerie sur mon bureau et, en fait, c'est de Cutty Machinery, c'est le nom du client.",entailment,"The premise ""jusqu'à aujourd'hui je ne peux plus rien faire"" translates to ""until today I can no longer do anything."" This statement suggests that the speaker is unable to perform tasks or actions up to the present day.

The hypothesis ""J'ai des prévisions de flux de trésorerie sur mon bureau et, en fait, c'est de Cutty Machinery, c'est le nom du client"" translates to ""I have cash flow forecasts on my desk and, in fact, it's from Cutty Machinery, that's the client's name."" This statement implies that the speaker has specific documents from a client on their desk.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise's focus on the speaker's inability to do anything does not directly contradict or confirm the presence of specific documents on their desk from a client. The premise and hypothesis address different aspects of the speaker's situation without overlapping in a way that would entail or contradict each other."
"Notre client, Cutty, gagne 10 000 $ par mois",Il y a un client qui s'appelle Cutty,neutral,Entailment

"Notre client, Cutty, gagne 10 000 $ par mois","je connais une femme qui peut me soutenir, mais elle vit trop loin",entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the monthly earnings of a client named Cutty, while the hypothesis talks about knowing a woman who can provide support but lives too far away. These statements do not logically connect to each other in a way that entails or contradicts."
la seule femme que tu puisses me toucher vit loin.,la femme qui va m'attraper est à 5 miles de là,contradiction,"The premise states ""la seule femme que tu puisses me toucher vit loin"" which translates to ""the only woman you can touch lives far away."" The hypothesis states ""la femme qui va m'attraper est à 5 miles de là"" which translates to ""the woman who is going to catch me is 5 miles away.""

Given the premise implies that the only woman the subject can touch lives far away, and the hypothesis suggests a woman (presumably the same one, based on the context of 'the woman') is only 5 miles away, which may or may not be considered ""far away"" depending on the context. Without additional context defining what ""far away"" specifically means in terms of distance, it is difficult to determine if 5 miles meets the criterion of being ""far away.""

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**, as there is not enough information to directly confirm or contradict the hypothesis based on the premise provided."
la seule femme que tu puisses me toucher vit loin.,Personne ne peut m'aider,entailment,"The premise ""la seule femme que tu puisses me toucher vit loin"" translates to ""the only woman you can touch me lives far away."" This statement is specifically about the distance of a particular woman who can touch the speaker.

The hypothesis ""Personne ne peut m'aider"" translates to ""No one can help me."" This statement is about the inability of anyone to provide help to the speaker.

These two statements are discussing different aspects: one is about the physical distance of a specific woman, and the other is about the general inability of anyone to provide assistance. There is no direct logical connection between the physical distance of a specific person and the general ability of anyone to provide help.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
la seule femme que tu puisses me toucher vit loin.,"mais ils se sont séparés pour savoir qui étaient les enfants du quartier, et qui étaient les enfants de la maison, c'était....",neutral,"The premise translates to ""The only woman you can touch me lives far away."" The hypothesis translates to ""but they separated to find out who were the children of the neighborhood, and who were the children of the house, it was....""

The premise discusses the distance of a specific woman, while the hypothesis talks about a group of people separating to identify children of different groups. There is no direct connection or opposition between the premise discussing a woman living far away and the hypothesis discussing the separation of a group for identification purposes.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Un accord pour cultiver ensemble,"ils ne pouvaient se mettre d'accord sur la question de savoir qui demandait le choix des métiers, et qui étaient les fils de la maison",neutral,"The premise ""Un accord pour cultiver ensemble"" translates to ""An agreement to cultivate together,"" indicating that there was a mutual agreement or cooperation.

The hypothesis ""ils ne pouvaient se mettre d'accord sur la question de savoir qui demandait le choix des métiers, et qui étaient les fils de la maison"" translates to ""they could not agree on the issue of who asked for the choice of trades, and who were the sons of the house,"" suggesting a disagreement or conflict.

Given that the premise speaks of an agreement, and the hypothesis speaks of a disagreement, the relationship between them is a contradiction."
Un accord pour cultiver ensemble,"ils pouvaient se mettre d'accord pour choisir qui travaillerait dans les champs de coton, et qui travaillerait sur les planchers.",contradiction,"Neutral. The premise ""Un accord pour cultiver ensemble"" simply states that there was an agreement to cultivate together. The hypothesis provides specific details about deciding who would work in the cotton fields and who on the floors, which are not mentioned or implied in the premise. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis, making the relationship neutral."
Un accord pour cultiver ensemble,"avec l'intention de dire qu'ils n'avaient que cinq enfants, dont un est mort",entailment,"Neutral. The premise ""Un accord pour cultiver ensemble"" (An agreement to cultivate together) does not provide any information about the intention of stating the number of children or any details about children at all. The hypothesis ""avec l'intention de dire qu'ils n'avaient que cinq enfants, dont un est mort"" (with the intention of saying that they had only five children, one of whom died) introduces new information that is unrelated to the premise. Therefore, the relationship is neutral, as the premise neither confirms nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Tous leurs descendants ont disparu,un enfant sur cinq risque de mourir,neutral,"The premise ""Tous leurs descendants ont disparu"" translates to ""All their descendants have disappeared."" The hypothesis ""un enfant sur cinq risque de mourir"" translates to ""one in five children is at risk of dying.""

The premise states that all descendants have already disappeared, implying no living descendants. The hypothesis discusses a risk of dying among children, implying that there are still living children.

This is a contradiction because the premise asserts the non-existence of any descendants, while the hypothesis assumes the existence of children who are at risk of dying."
Tous leurs descendants ont disparu,l'enfant décédé était malade,entailment,"This is neutral. The premise ""Tous leurs descendants ont disparu"" (All their descendants have disappeared) does not provide any information about the health status of any specific descendant, such as whether a child was sick or not. Therefore, the hypothesis ""l'enfant décédé était malade"" (the deceased child was sick) neither follows from nor contradicts the premise directly."
Tous leurs descendants ont disparu,elle a effacé les larmes rapidement après avoir jeté Joe hors de la véranda.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise ""Tous leurs descendants ont disparu"" (All their descendants have disappeared) does not logically connect with the hypothesis ""elle a effacé les larmes rapidement après avoir jeté Joe hors de la véranda"" (she wiped away the tears quickly after throwing Joe out of the porch). The premise discusses the disappearance of descendants, while the hypothesis describes a specific emotional and physical action involving individuals not mentioned in the premise. Thus, there is no direct entailment or contradiction between the two statements."
elle s'est mise à pleurer parce que la joie de voir Joe était immense,La radiation peut également être contenue dans un incendie.,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses someone crying due to the immense joy of seeing Joe, while the hypothesis talks about radiation being contained in a fire. These two statements are unrelated to each other."
elle s'est mise à pleurer parce que la joie de voir Joe était immense,La radiation peut apparaître dans un composant en plomb après l'incendie d'un avion.,entailment,"The premise and the hypothesis are unrelated. The premise discusses a person crying due to the immense joy of seeing Joe, while the hypothesis talks about radiation appearing in a lead component after an airplane fire. There is no logical connection or contradiction between the emotional response to a reunion and the technical details of radiation in an airplane component.

Answer: Neutral"
elle s'est mise à pleurer parce que la joie de voir Joe était immense,La radiation ne se produit pas par le feu.,neutral,"The premise discusses a person crying due to the immense joy of seeing Joe. The hypothesis states that radiation does not occur by fire. These two statements are unrelated to each other, as the premise deals with an emotional response to a personal interaction, while the hypothesis discusses a physical phenomenon. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"C'est le sergent-major en chef Clem Francis, un ancien combattant de l'armée de l'air américaine.",le chef est un retraité de l'armée de l'air américaine,contradiction,Entailment
"C'est le sergent-major en chef Clem Francis, un ancien combattant de l'armée de l'air américaine.",le chef vient de prendre sa retraite il y a quelques semaines,neutral,"Neutral. The premise states that Clem Francis is a chief master sergeant and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, but it does not provide information about whether he has recently retired. The hypothesis suggests that he retired a few weeks ago, which is not confirmed or denied by the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
"C'est le sergent-major en chef Clem Francis, un ancien combattant de l'armée de l'air américaine.",le chef d'état-major de l'armée de l'air américaine a pris ses fonctions cette semaine,entailment,"The premise states that Clem Francis is a senior sergeant major and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. The hypothesis claims that the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force took office this week.

The premise and hypothesis discuss different roles within the U.S. Air Force. A ""sergent-major en chef"" (senior sergeant major) is a non-commissioned officer rank, whereas the ""chef d'état-major"" (Chief of Staff) is a high-ranking commissioned officer position. Therefore, the information about Clem Francis does not necessarily relate to the position of Chief of Staff.

This scenario is neutral, as the premise neither confirms nor contradicts the hypothesis. The roles and events described in each statement are independent of each other."
"donc, c'est un endroit où deux ou trois avions arrivent par semaine, et je ne sais pas où ils allaient",les avions le fleuve coule chaque semaine,contradiction,"The premise discusses the frequency of airplanes arriving per week and the speaker's uncertainty about their destinations. The hypothesis mentions ""les avions le fleuve coule chaque semaine,"" which seems to be a grammatically incorrect or unclear statement, but it seems to attempt to say something about airplanes and a river flowing every week.

Given that the premise is about the arrival of airplanes and does not mention anything about a river or it flowing, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is:

Neutral - The premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis, primarily due to the lack of relevant information in the premise about a river flowing."
"donc, c'est un endroit où deux ou trois avions arrivent par semaine, et je ne sais pas où ils allaient",il n'y a plus d'avion qui arrive,neutral,Contradiction
"donc, c'est un endroit où deux ou trois avions arrivent par semaine, et je ne sais pas où ils allaient",il faut beaucoup de temps pour apprendre à utiliser la combinaison à pression complète,entailment,"The premise discusses the frequency of airplanes arriving at a location and the speaker's uncertainty about their destinations. The hypothesis talks about the time it takes to learn how to use a full pressure suit. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis regarding the content discussed.

Therefore, the relationship is **neutral**."
nous allons vous apprendre à utiliser la combinaison à pression avant la fin de l'année,J'aimerais dire qu'il n'y avait aucun risque d'entrer dans la bombe parce qu'elle ne peut pas exploser même un coup de feu et une forte explosion.,neutral,"The premise states that ""we will teach you how to use the pressure suit before the end of the year."" The hypothesis states, ""I would like to say that there was no risk of entering the bomb because it cannot explode even with a gunshot and a strong explosion.""

The premise discusses teaching how to use a pressure suit, which does not directly address the safety or explosive capabilities of a bomb. The hypothesis, on the other hand, discusses the safety of entering a bomb and its resistance to explosions.

Since the premise and the hypothesis discuss different subjects (a pressure suit versus the safety of a bomb), there is no direct entailment or contradiction between them. 

The relationship is **neutral**."
nous allons vous apprendre à utiliser la combinaison à pression avant la fin de l'année,Le pilote a désactivé les bombes,contradiction,"The premise states that ""we will teach you how to use the pressure suit before the end of the year,"" while the hypothesis states that ""the pilot has defused the bombs."" These two statements are unrelated as the premise discusses teaching how to use a pressure suit, and the hypothesis discusses an action taken by a pilot regarding bombs. There is no direct connection or conflict between the content of the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
nous allons vous apprendre à utiliser la combinaison à pression avant la fin de l'année,La bombe ne pouvait pas exploser,entailment,"Neutral.

Explanation: The premise talks about teaching someone to use a pressure suit before the end of the year, while the hypothesis discusses a bomb not being able to explode. These two statements are unrelated to each other, as the premise does not provide any information about a bomb or its ability to explode. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
il y avait trop de risque pour que la bombe explose,quelque chose qui ressemble à ce que j'essaie de faire,entailment,Neutral.
il y avait trop de risque pour que la bombe explose,je ne sais pas à quoi vous ressemblez,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the risk of a bomb exploding, while the hypothesis is about not knowing what someone looks like. These two statements are unrelated to each other."
il y avait trop de risque pour que la bombe explose,il semble que j'essaie de le faire,neutral,"The premise states ""there was too much risk for the bomb to explode,"" while the hypothesis states ""it seems that I am trying to do it."" The premise discusses the risk associated with a bomb exploding, while the hypothesis suggests an attempt or effort to do something, but it does not specify what that something is.

Since the hypothesis does not clearly specify what the effort is directed towards (whether it is related to the bomb exploding or something else), there is no direct logical connection that can be clearly established between the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine,"quoi qu'il en soit, vos animaux sont toujours morts, surtout les chèvres",entailment,"The premise ""je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine"" translates to ""I will do my best to finish my project next week."" The hypothesis ""quoi qu'il en soit, vos animaux sont toujours morts, surtout les chèvres"" translates to ""regardless, your animals are still dead, especially the goats.""

These two statements are unrelated in content; the premise discusses completing a project, while the hypothesis discusses the death of animals. There is no logical connection or contradiction between the two statements.

The relationship is neutral."
je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine,tes chèvres quittent leur maison tous les jours,neutral,"The premise ""je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine"" translates to ""I will do my best to finish my project next week."" The hypothesis ""tes chèvres quittent leur maison tous les jours"" translates to ""your goats leave their home every day.""

These two statements are unrelated. The premise discusses a person's intention to finish a project, while the hypothesis talks about goats leaving their home daily. There is no logical connection or overlap between the subject of completing a project and the behavior of goats.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine,Les chèvres faisaient souvent la queue,contradiction,"The premise ""je ferai de mon mieux pour terminer mon projet la semaine prochaine"" translates to ""I will do my best to finish my project next week."" The hypothesis ""Les chèvres faisaient souvent la queue"" translates to ""The goats often lined up.""

These two statements are unrelated. The premise discusses a person's intention to finish a project, while the hypothesis talks about the behavior of goats. There is no logical connection between the two.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Des chèvres bien protégées,les portes étaient fermées quand nous sommes arrivés,contradiction,"The premise ""Des chèvres bien protégées"" translates to ""Well-protected goats."" The hypothesis ""les portes étaient fermées quand nous sommes arrivés"" translates to ""the doors were closed when we arrived.""

The premise discusses goats being well-protected but does not specify how the protection is implemented, whether through closed doors, fences, or other means. The hypothesis specifically mentions that doors were closed upon arrival.

Since the premise does not provide information about the doors or the method of protection, it does not necessarily imply that the doors being closed is the method of protection. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Des chèvres bien protégées,Toutes les portes étaient ouvertes,entailment,Neutral
Des chèvres bien protégées,ou ils ont fait une explosion,neutral,"The premise ""Des chèvres bien protégées"" translates to ""Well-protected goats."" The hypothesis ""ou ils ont fait une explosion"" translates to ""or they made an explosion.""

The premise discusses goats being well-protected, which has no direct or implied connection to making an explosion. Therefore, the premise neither supports nor directly contradicts the hypothesis.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
ou est entré alors que les portes étaient fermées à clé,"Donc, il suffisait de prendre les totaux et d'essayer de les graphiser.",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses someone entering while the doors were locked, and the hypothesis talks about taking totals and trying to graph them. There is no direct logical connection or contradiction between the two statements."
ou est entré alors que les portes étaient fermées à clé,"Je ne sais pas ce qu'il faut faire avec les totaux, mais donnez-moi des détails pour résoudre ce problème.",entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses someone entering while the doors were locked, and the hypothesis talks about not knowing what to do with totals and asking for details to solve a problem. These statements do not logically support or contradict each other directly."
ou est entré alors que les portes étaient fermées à clé,le temps de calcul est suivi par les résultats,neutral,"The premise ""You entered while the doors were locked"" and the hypothesis ""The calculation time is followed by the results"" are unrelated statements. The premise discusses a physical action involving locked doors, while the hypothesis deals with a sequence of events in a computational or analytical context. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as neither statement logically implies nor contradicts the other."
ont été expulsés cette année,"Ces facteurs incluent des délais plus courts, la suppression des fichiers informatiques primaires et le manque d'accès aux documents essentiels.",neutral,"Neutral. 

The premise ""ont été expulsés cette année"" (have been expelled this year) does not provide any information about the reasons or factors (such as shorter deadlines, deletion of primary computer files, or lack of access to essential documents) mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, there is no direct relationship or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis."
ont été expulsés cette année,"Ensuite, un représentant qui a effectué la première visite a invité le fournisseur à répondre à des questions afin de discuter des problèmes observés dans l'échantillon de récupération.",entailment,"The premise ""ont été expulsés cette année"" translates to ""were expelled this year."" The hypothesis ""Ensuite, un représentant qui a effectué la première visite a invité le fournisseur à répondre à des questions afin de discuter des problèmes observés dans l'échantillon de récupération"" translates to ""Then, a representative who conducted the first visit invited the supplier to answer questions to discuss the issues observed in the recovery sample.""

The premise discusses someone being expelled this year, while the hypothesis talks about a representative inviting a supplier to discuss issues related to a recovery sample. There is no direct or indirect connection between someone being expelled and a discussion about recovery samples.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
ont été expulsés cette année,"l'épargne n'affecte pas l'acquisition d'actions, mais la richesse influence le choix de l'épargne",contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise, which translates to ""have been expelled this year,"" does not provide any information regarding savings, stock acquisition, or wealth influencing savings choices, as mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, there is no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements."

"Par exemple, une organisation qui a fait l'objet de deux fusions a dû intégrer rapidement les contrats et se restructurer pour répondre aux besoins commerciaux.",la fusion de deux entreprises au sein d'une même organisation et la restructuration ont conduit à un environnement de travail très hostile,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses an organization that underwent two mergers and had to quickly integrate contracts and restructure to meet business needs. However, it does not provide any information about the resulting work environment, whether it was hostile or not. The hypothesis suggests that the mergers and restructuring led to a very hostile work environment. Since the premise does not address the atmosphere of the work environment post-merger and restructuring, it neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is neutral."
"Par exemple, une organisation qui a fait l'objet de deux fusions a dû intégrer rapidement les contrats et se restructurer pour répondre aux besoins commerciaux.",Nous avons examiné une entreprise qui a subi une fusion et qui s'est restructurée rapidement afin de répondre aux exigences commerciales.,contradiction,"The answer is neutral.

Explanation:
The premise states that an organization underwent two mergers and had to quickly integrate contracts and restructure to meet business needs. The hypothesis, however, mentions only one merger and a quick restructuring to meet business requirements. Since the hypothesis specifies only one merger while the premise mentions two, the information does not directly contradict but neither does it fully align. Thus, the relationship is neutral, as the hypothesis neither completely matches nor directly contradicts the details provided in the premise."
"quand nous l'avons fait, nous nous sommes inquiétés parce que les paiements auraient été autorisés avant de vérifier que le voyage avait été effectué.",Le logiciel de planification avancée est l'une des technologies les plus précieuses recherchées par les entreprises,neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses concerns about payments being authorized before verifying a trip was made, while the hypothesis talks about the value of advanced scheduling software to businesses. There is no direct connection or conflict between the two statements."
"quand nous l'avons fait, nous nous sommes inquiétés parce que les paiements auraient été autorisés avant de vérifier que le voyage avait été effectué.",les deux concepts qui apparaissent dans le temps et la littérature peuvent aider à la recherche dans les jours à venir,contradiction,"The premise discusses a situation where there was concern because payments were authorized before verifying that a trip had been made. The hypothesis talks about two concepts appearing in time and literature that could aid future research. 

There is no direct connection or opposition between the premise discussing concerns about payment authorization and the hypothesis discussing concepts in time and literature aiding research. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
"quand nous l'avons fait, nous nous sommes inquiétés parce que les paiements auraient été autorisés avant de vérifier que le voyage avait été effectué.",la littérature peut modifier la forme ou tester les échantillons,entailment,"The premise discusses concerns about payments being authorized before verifying that a trip had been made. The hypothesis talks about literature being able to change form or test samples. 

These two statements are unrelated to each other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
la littérature peut changer la recherche à l'avenir,il n'y a rien d'autre à faire pour changer la recherche,entailment,"This is a contradiction.

Premise: Literature can change research in the future.
Hypothesis: There is nothing else to do to change research.

The premise suggests that literature has the potential to influence or change research, implying that action can be taken (through literature) to effect change. The hypothesis states that there is nothing that can be done to change research, implying that no action, including through literature, can influence research. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis directly contradict each other."
la littérature peut changer la recherche à l'avenir,"Ces lignes sont des cases qui indiquent le niveau de disponibilité de tous les expéditeurs combinés, et ces lignes sont des diamants qui indiquent les pertes techniques (si elles sont négatives) du transfert d'un service à l'autre.",neutral,"The premise and the hypothesis are discussing completely different subjects. The premise talks about literature potentially changing research in the future, while the hypothesis discusses graphical representations of availability levels and technical losses in service transfer. There is no direct relationship or contradiction between the two statements.

Answer: Neutral"
la littérature peut changer la recherche à l'avenir,les lignes ne calculent que le niveau de qualité des expéditeurs et c'est 10%,contradiction,"This is neutral. The premise discusses the potential impact of literature on future research, while the hypothesis talks about lines calculating the quality level of senders at 10%, which is unrelated to the premise. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the two statements."

The premise, which states that ""the lines only show the route,"" does not provide any information related to risk assessment or the development of specific prevention strategies by Centerlink, as mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, there is no direct connection or conflict between the premise and the hypothesis."
les lignes ne montrent que l'itinéraire,Centrelink ne savait pas qui était le traître,entailment,"The premise ""les lignes ne montrent que l'itinéraire"" translates to ""the lines only show the route."" The hypothesis ""Centrelink ne savait pas qui était le traître"" translates to ""Centrelink did not know who the traitor was.""

These two statements are about completely different subjects: one is about lines showing a route, and the other is about Centrelink's knowledge regarding a traitor. There is no logical connection or overlap between the subjects of the two statements.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."

The premise states that Centerlink has developed numerous strategies to educate people on how to report income because errors are costly to the state. The hypothesis, however, specifically mentions that Centerlink is offering numerous strategies to teach children how to declare their income. The premise does not specify that the strategies are targeted at children, but rather at people in general. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise."
"Centerlink a développé de nombreuses stratégies pour éduquer les gens sur la manière de déclarer les revenus, car les erreurs coûtent énormément d'argent à l'État.","Cela peut aider à faire des démonstrations et aider les sociétés à éviter, dans la phase pilote, d'investir beaucoup d'équipements et d'outils de production pour créer des prototypes représentatifs du produit fini.",entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses Centerlink's strategies to educate people on how to report income to prevent costly mistakes for the state. The hypothesis, on the other hand, talks about helping companies avoid large investments in equipment and production tools during the pilot phase to create representative prototypes of the final product. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the strategies for educating about income reporting and the strategies for reducing investment in prototype production."

The premise discusses Centerlink developing strategies to educate people on how to report income because errors are costly to the state. The hypothesis, which is incomplete and vague, suggests that something might also show how a principle works, but it does not specify what is being shown or how it relates directly to the premise. There is no direct contradiction or confirmation of the premise in the hypothesis provided."

The premise discusses the council not giving any SBA certification and leaving it to the assessor's office. The hypothesis talks about a process of removing a part, choosing an appropriate option, preparing something for an address, and sending it in a provided envelope. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the actions described in the premise and those in the hypothesis. They discuss different aspects and do not logically influence each other."

80% des participants doivent démontrer un niveau élevé de compétence et de connaissances alors qu'ils apportent des solutions aux problèmes.,plus de la moitié des participants vont présenter leur expertise,neutral,"The premise states that 80% of participants must demonstrate a high level of skill and knowledge as they provide solutions to problems. The hypothesis states that more than half of the participants will present their expertise.

In this case, if 80% (which is more than half) of the participants are required to demonstrate high competence and knowledge, it logically follows that more than half of the participants will indeed present their expertise, as demonstrating high competence and knowledge involves presenting expertise.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is an **entailment**."
80% des participants doivent démontrer un niveau élevé de compétence et de connaissances alors qu'ils apportent des solutions aux problèmes.,seulement un quart des participants ont montré des connaissances en planification,entailment,"This is a contradiction. The premise states that 80% of participants must demonstrate a high level of skill and knowledge in solving problems, which implies that a large majority are expected to show significant competence. The hypothesis, however, claims that only a quarter of the participants have shown knowledge in planning, suggesting a much lower level of competence and knowledge than required by the premise."
80% des participants doivent démontrer un niveau élevé de compétence et de connaissances alors qu'ils apportent des solutions aux problèmes.,plus de 100 participants,contradiction,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses a requirement for a certain percentage of participants to demonstrate high levels of skill and knowledge, but it does not specify the total number of participants. The hypothesis states that there are more than 100 participants, which neither directly follows from nor contradicts the information given in the premise. Therefore, the answer is neutral."
bo eviter vous êtes sur la liste des donneurs de perime,ce serait dommage si vous arrêtiez de faire des dons,contradiction,"The premise states that ""you are on the list of expired donors,"" which implies that you are currently considered a donor but the status or relevance of your donations may be in question due to some aspect of expiration.

The hypothesis states ""it would be a shame if you stopped donating,"" which implies a suggestion or opinion that continuing donations is desirable.

The premise and the hypothesis do not have a direct logical connection where one necessarily follows from the other. The premise does not provide information about the desirability or the consequences of stopping donations, only that the person is on a specific list which might imply an issue with their donations.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
bo eviter vous êtes sur la liste des donneurs de perime,"la liste des offres refusées est publiée publiquement, croyez-moi, je ne crois pas que vous vouliez être humiliés de cette façon",neutral,"The premise states that you are on the list of expired donors, while the hypothesis discusses a publicly published list of rejected offers and suggests it would be humiliating to be on that list.

These two statements discuss different lists and contexts: one is about donors of expired items, and the other is about rejected offers. There is no direct connection or opposition stated between being on the list of expired donors and being on a list of rejected offers.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
bo eviter vous êtes sur la liste des donneurs de perime,"nous donnons beaucoup, alors arrêtez de donner",entailment,"The premise and hypothesis provided are in French. Translating them to English:

Premise: ""bo eviter vous êtes sur la liste des donneurs de perime"" (This seems to be a partially incorrect or unclear phrase in French, but it seems to imply ""be careful, you are on the list of expired donors"").
Hypothesis: ""nous donnons beaucoup, alors arrêtez de donner"" (we give a lot, so stop giving).

Based on the translations and the context provided:

- The premise suggests that the subject is on a list of donors, possibly implying they have been giving or are scheduled to give.
- The hypothesis states that ""we give a lot"" and therefore should ""stop giving.""

Given that the premise implies inclusion on a donor list (suggesting giving), and the hypothesis suggests that there has been sufficient giving and it should be stopped, the relationship can be seen as:

**Neutral**: The premise does not directly state that there has been excessive giving, just that the subject is on a donor list. The hypothesis introduces a new idea of stopping the giving due to its abundance. The premise does not necessarily support nor directly contradict this new information. Thus, the relationship is neutral, as the premise neither directly entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."

The hypothesis suggests that ""people need to bring their computers and modems; I was born with them at the place.""

The hypothesis is somewhat unclear due to the phrase ""je suis né avec eux à la place,"" which seems to be a mistranslation or miscommunication. However, the initial part of the hypothesis, suggesting that people need to bring their computers and modems, aligns with the premise that access to the establishment requires having a computer and a modem.

Given that the core requirement in both the premise and the initial part of the hypothesis is the possession of a computer and a modem, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. However, the added confusion from the latter part of the hypothesis (""I was born with them at the place"") does not directly relate to the premise and seems irrelevant.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is best described as **neutral**. The hypothesis neither clearly contradicts nor directly follows from the premise due to the additional, unrelated information."
les ventes de billets et les abonnements ne suffisent pas pour nous financer pour la saison,"si on ne se lasse pas de vendre des billets, toute notre saison sera financière",contradiction,"The premise states that ticket sales and subscriptions alone are not enough to finance the season. The hypothesis suggests that if ticket sales continue without fatigue, the entire season will be financially covered.

This presents a contradiction because the premise clearly indicates that ticket sales and subscriptions are insufficient for financing the season, whereas the hypothesis implies that continuous ticket sales could fully finance the season.

Answer: Contradiction."
les ventes de billets et les abonnements ne suffisent pas pour nous financer pour la saison,nous avons besoin de plus d'argent que nous n'en avons pour financer notre saison (seulement la vente des billets et des abonnements),entailment,"Entailment. 

The premise states that ticket sales and subscriptions alone are not sufficient to finance the season. The hypothesis states that more money is needed than is currently available from just ticket sales and subscriptions to fund the season. The hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as both indicate that the current funds from ticket sales and subscriptions are inadequate."
les ventes de billets et les abonnements ne suffisent pas pour nous financer pour la saison,les ventes de billets et d'abonnements ne couvrent que 70% des coûts de financement pour chaque saison,neutral,"The premise states that ticket sales and subscriptions alone are insufficient to fully fund the season. The hypothesis claims that ticket sales and subscriptions cover only 70% of the financing costs for each season.

This relationship is an entailment because the hypothesis specifies a scenario (covering only 70% of costs) that fits within the broader statement of the premise (not enough to fully fund the season). Therefore, if the hypothesis is true, it confirms the premise's claim of insufficiency in funding."
arrivées immédiates! chaque cadeau fera la différence,tous les dons sont enregistrés et annoncés dans notre journal mensuel,neutral,"The premise states ""arrivées immédiates! chaque cadeau fera la différence"" which translates to ""immediate arrivals! each gift will make a difference."" This focuses on the immediate impact and importance of each gift.

The hypothesis states ""tous les dons sont enregistrés et annoncés dans notre journal mensuel,"" which translates to ""all donations are recorded and announced in our monthly journal."" This focuses on the recording and public acknowledgment of donations.

The premise does not provide any information about whether donations are recorded or announced in a journal. Therefore, the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis.

The relationship is **neutral**."
arrivées immédiates! chaque cadeau fera la différence,chaque cadeau a une signification,entailment,"This is neutral. The premise states that ""each gift will make a difference,"" which implies that each gift has an impact or is important. The hypothesis states that ""each gift has a meaning,"" which suggests that each gift carries a specific significance or value. While both statements highlight the importance of the gifts, the premise does not directly address whether each gift has a specific meaning, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral; the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
arrivées immédiates! chaque cadeau fera la différence,seuls les cadeaux de plus de 100$ sont nécessaires,contradiction,"The premise states ""arrivées immédiates! chaque cadeau fera la différence"" which translates to ""immediate arrivals! each gift will make a difference."" This implies that every gift, regardless of its value, is important and can have an impact.

The hypothesis states ""seuls les cadeaux de plus de 100$ sont nécessaires,"" which translates to ""only gifts over $100 are necessary."" This suggests that only gifts exceeding a certain monetary value are considered necessary or impactful.

Since the premise suggests that every gift is valuable, while the hypothesis claims only gifts over a specific amount are necessary, there is a contradiction between the two statements.

Answer: Contradiction."
Nous avons encore un long chemin à parcourir avant d'atteindre notre objectif de 365 000 $ qui vient de vos amis et abonnés.,Notre objectif financier est supérieur à 300 000$,entailment,Entailment.
Nous avons encore un long chemin à parcourir avant d'atteindre notre objectif de 365 000 $ qui vient de vos amis et abonnés.,nous prévoyons de multiplier par trois notre objectif financier,neutral,"The premise states that there is still a long way to go before reaching a financial goal of $365,000, which is sourced from friends and subscribers. The hypothesis suggests planning to triple the financial goal. 

This does not directly contradict or entail the premise. The premise simply states the current goal and the progress, while the hypothesis talks about future plans to increase the goal. The premise does not provide information on whether tripling the goal is feasible or intended, nor does it deny the possibility.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**."
Nous avons encore un long chemin à parcourir avant d'atteindre notre objectif de 365 000 $ qui vient de vos amis et abonnés.,nous avons quelque chose à comparer à l'argent,contradiction,"This is neutral. The premise discusses having a long way to go to reach a financial goal from friends and subscribers, but it does not directly address having something to compare to money, which is what the hypothesis suggests. Thus, there is no direct entailment or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis."
Notre clinique de pratique civile existe depuis de nombreuses années et nous avons récemment ajouté ici une clinique de défense pénale.,notre clinique de pratique civile existe depuis huit ans,neutral,"The premise states that the civil practice clinic has existed for ""de nombreuses années"" (many years), but does not specify exactly how many years. The hypothesis claims that the clinic has existed for ""huit ans"" (eight years).

Since ""many years"" could indeed include eight years but is not specific to eight years alone, the statement is not definitively confirmed by the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
Notre clinique de pratique civile existe depuis de nombreuses années et nous avons récemment ajouté ici une clinique de défense pénale.,notre clinique de pratique civile fêtera son premier anniversaire ce mois-ci,contradiction,"This is a contradiction. The premise states that the civil practice clinic has existed for many years, which contradicts the hypothesis that it will celebrate its first anniversary this month."
Notre clinique de pratique civile existe depuis de nombreuses années et nous avons récemment ajouté ici une clinique de défense pénale.,la loi sur la pratique civile est entrée en vigueur l'année dernière,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise states that the civil practice clinic has been in existence for many years and that a criminal defense clinic was recently added. The hypothesis states that the civil practice law came into effect last year. The premise does not provide any information about when the civil practice law came into effect, only the duration of the clinic's existence and its expansion. Therefore, there is no direct connection or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis regarding the timing of the civil practice law's enactment."
les revenus de ces billets ne couvrent pas le cout de ces programmes,il semble que l'argent pour les programmes qui en résultent et les recettes de la vente des billets ne suffisent pas,neutral,Entailment
les revenus de ces billets ne couvrent pas le cout de ces programmes,mais ces programmes sont trop chers,contradiction,"The premise states that ""the revenue from these tickets does not cover the cost of these programs,"" indicating that the income generated is insufficient to meet the expenses of the programs. 

The hypothesis states that ""but these programs are too expensive,"" which implies that the cost of the programs is high.

The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise focuses on the financial shortfall (revenue not covering costs), while the hypothesis comments on the high cost of the programs. While the premise might suggest reasons why someone could consider the programs expensive, it does not directly assert that the programs are too expensive. Thus, the premise neither directly supports (entails) nor contradicts the hypothesis."
les revenus de ces billets ne couvrent pas le cout de ces programmes,Les revenus provenant des ventes de billets sont suffisants pour couvrir les coûts des programmes.,entailment,"This is a contradiction. The premise states that the revenues from the tickets do not cover the cost of the programs, while the hypothesis claims that the revenues from ticket sales are sufficient to cover the costs of the programs. These two statements are directly opposed to each other."

The premise discusses the character and legal standing of a roommate who rented a room to Hazmi and Mihdhar in 2000, focusing on their respectability and good reputation with local police and the FBI. The hypothesis, on the other hand, refers to an intelligence report and the interrogation of a Saudi member of Al-Qaeda on a specific date in 2001, related to a trip to Bosnia. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the character of the roommate and the details of the intelligence report or interrogation mentioned in the hypothesis. Thus, the correct answer is neutral."

The premise discusses the character and reputation of the roommate who rented a room to Hazmi and Mihdhar, mentioning nothing about any financial transactions or forms related to money provided by a FISA intelligence provider. The hypothesis, on the other hand, involves a specific inquiry about Mihdhar signing a form related to financial matters, which is unrelated to the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."
Le colocataire qui a loué une chambre à Hazmi et Mihdhar en 2000 est un citoyen respectueux de la loi et a une bonne réputation de plusieurs années auprès de la police locale et du FBI.,Jane a exigé que le formulaire de confirmation FISA soit signé par un juge fédéral.,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the character and reputation of the roommate who rented a room to Hazmi and Mihdhar in 2000, emphasizing their lawful behavior and good standing with local police and the FBI. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is about Jane demanding a FISA confirmation form to be signed by a federal judge, which is a completely different subject. There is no direct connection or conflict between the premise and the hypothesis, as they address unrelated issues."
"Ce n'est pas surprenant pour eux, d'adopter une mesure de sécurité qui était précieuse pour les contrôles aux checkpoints.",aucune preuve n'a été trouvée lors de l'inspection au poste de contrôle,entailment,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the adoption of a valuable security measure for checkpoints, but it does not provide information about the findings or outcomes (such as finding proof or evidence) during an inspection at a checkpoint. The hypothesis states that no proof was found during an inspection at a checkpoint, which does not directly contradict or confirm anything about the effectiveness or details of the security measure discussed in the premise."
"Ce n'est pas surprenant pour eux, d'adopter une mesure de sécurité qui était précieuse pour les contrôles aux checkpoints.",Les vérifications aux points de contrôle ne sont effectuées qu'à l'instinct des agents douaniers qui effectuent les vérifications.,contradiction,"The premise states that adopting a security measure valuable for checkpoint controls is not surprising for them. This implies that there is a specific, valuable security measure in place for checkpoint controls.

The hypothesis claims that checks at checkpoints are conducted solely based on the instincts of the customs agents performing the checks, suggesting there is no specific protocol or measure guiding these checks.

Given that the premise implies the existence of a valuable security measure at checkpoints, while the hypothesis suggests that checks are solely based on instinct (implying the absence of a specific guiding measure), the two statements are in opposition.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction."
"Ce n'est pas surprenant pour eux, d'adopter une mesure de sécurité qui était précieuse pour les contrôles aux checkpoints.","Sa découverte aurait nécessité une coopération rapide et efficace du gouvernement allemand, ce qui aurait été difficile à obtenir.",neutral,"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise discusses the adoption of a valuable security measure at checkpoints, while the hypothesis talks about the need for rapid and efficient cooperation from the German government for a discovery, which would have been difficult to obtain. There is no direct connection or contradiction between the security measures mentioned in the premise and the issues of governmental cooperation discussed in the hypothesis."

The hypothesis talks about officers being deployed to assist in evacuating stairwells and other areas such as the esplanade, entrance hall, and metro station.

These two statements are discussing completely different topics: one is about an analyst's confusion over legal and procedural matters, and the other is about physical evacuation efforts by officers. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as neither statement entails nor contradicts the other."
Le courrier électronique de l'analyste montre qu'il confond un large éventail d'alertes et d'obstacles juridiques au partage d'informations ainsi que des règles d'utilisation des informations obtenues par les agents criminels dans le cadre du renseignement.,"L'incapacité à communiquer a été un élément déterminant dans la chute du World Trade Center, du Pentagone, du comté de Somerset, ainsi que de la Pennsylvanie, où des organismes et des administrations ont été impliqués.",entailment,"Neutral. The premise discusses the confusion of an analyst regarding a range of alerts and legal obstacles related to information sharing and the rules for using information obtained by criminal agents in intelligence. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the inability to communicate was a key factor in the events at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, Somerset County, and Pennsylvania involving various agencies and administrations. There is no direct link or contradiction between the analyst's confusion about information sharing and the communication issues mentioned in the hypothesis related to specific events. Therefore, the relationship is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis."

The premise discusses the confusion of an analyst regarding a range of alerts and legal obstacles related to information sharing and the rules for using information obtained by criminal agents in intelligence contexts. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a general statement about communication functioning well on September 11, without specifying the context or the type of communication. There is no direct link or contradiction between the confusion of the analyst about specific legal and procedural issues and the overall effectiveness of communication on a particular date. Therefore, the answer is neutral."

These two statements do not logically connect or contradict each other in any way."
les gens ne pouvaient pas parler au World Trade Center,les chercheurs demandent votre autorisation pour inclure des données professionnelles,neutral,"The premise states that people could not speak at the World Trade Center, while the hypothesis states that researchers are asking for your permission to include professional data.

These two statements do not directly relate to each other in terms of content. The premise is about the improvement of a series' ambiance by a specific person, while the hypothesis deals with a film's content about a person's preferences for depicting his death.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral** as they discuss different subjects without any direct contradiction or entailment."

"Malheureusement, dans une affaire commerciale à New-York, Klayman a été accusé de partialité ethnique.",Klayman ne pensait pas qu'il pourrait être accusé pour son tribalisme.,neutral,"The premise states that Klayman was accused of ethnic bias in a business matter in New York. The hypothesis suggests that Klayman did not think he could be accused of tribalism. 

The terms ""ethnic bias"" and ""tribalism"" could be considered related but are not necessarily synonymous. Ethnic bias generally refers to prejudice or discrimination based on ethnicity, while tribalism can refer to loyalties to a particular group or tribe, which could be based on various factors including but not limited to ethnicity.

Since the premise does not provide information about Klayman's thoughts or expectations regarding the accusation, and the terms used are not exactly the same but related, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. There is no direct contradiction or clear entailment based on the information given."

The hypothesis suggests that there were people accusing the Klaymans of ""tribalisme"" (tribalism). 

Although both terms involve allegations of bias based on group affiliations, ethnic bias and tribalism are not synonymous. Ethnic bias refers specifically to prejudice based on ethnicity, while tribalism can refer to biases based on broader or different group identities, which might not necessarily be defined by ethnicity alone (such as political, regional, or cultural groups).

Given that the terms do not perfectly overlap and the premise does not confirm anything about accusations of tribalism, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis."

tous les athlètes sont nés forts,la force de l'athlète dépend de l'entraînement plutôt que du sang,neutral,"The premise ""tous les athlètes sont nés forts"" (all athletes are born strong) suggests that athletes inherently possess strength from birth. The hypothesis ""la force de l'athlète dépend de l'entraînement plutôt que du sang"" (the athlete's strength depends on training rather than blood) implies that strength is primarily acquired through training rather than being an innate quality.

These statements present opposing ideas about the origin of an athlete's strength. The premise asserts that strength is innate (from birth), while the hypothesis argues that it is acquired (through training). Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction."
tous les athlètes sont nés forts,les athlètes sérieux s'entraînent au moins huit heures par semaine,entailment,"The premise ""tous les athlètes sont nés forts"" (all athletes are born strong) does not logically imply anything about how many hours athletes train per week. The hypothesis ""les athlètes sérieux s'entraînent au moins huit heures par semaine"" (serious athletes train at least eight hours per week) is about the training habits of serious athletes, which is unrelated to the inherent strength they were born with as stated in the premise.

The premise expresses a personal interest in politics, while the hypothesis states that the speaker has heard about America. There is no direct logical connection between liking politics and having heard about America.

The hypothesis ""J'ai entendu dire que les États-Unis vont réduire les provisions de deux sortes de retour chez eux"" translates to ""I heard that the United States is going to reduce provisions of two kinds back home.""

The premise states a personal interest in politics, while the hypothesis discusses a specific action supposedly being taken by the United States regarding provisions. There is no direct logical connection between someone liking politics and the specific actions of the United States government.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is **neutral**. The premise neither logically entails nor contradicts the hypothesis."

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral."
